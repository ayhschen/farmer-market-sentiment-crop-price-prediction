    "November_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, reduced use, and smaller ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 13.661 billion bushels, down 118 million from last month on a 1.4-bushel reduction in yield to 167.0 bushels per acre.  Feed and residual use is down 25 million bushels based on a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  Exports are reduced reflecting the slow pace of early-season sales and shipments.  Corn used for ethanol is down 25 million bushels based on September data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and weekly ethanol production data as reported by the Energy Information Administration for the month of October.  With supply falling more than use, corn ending stocks are lowered 18 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents to $3.85 per bushel based on observed prices to date. Global coarse grain production for 2019/20 is forecast 1.8 million tons lower to 1,394.9 million.  This month\u2019s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, increased trade, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher as increases for several African countries, as well as Russia and Turkey, more than offset declines for Mexico, Ukraine, and the EU.  For Mexico, production is lowered as area for summer season corn is expected to be the lowest on record.  Yield forecasts for Russia and Ukraine are raised and lowered, respectively, based on observed harvest results to date.Corn exports are raised for Brazil and Russia, with reductions for the United States and Mexico.  For 2018/19, corn exports for Brazil are raised for the local marketing year beginning March 2019, based on shipments observed through October.  For 2019/20, corn imports are raised for Vietnam, Colombia, Japan, and South Korea.  Partly offsetting, are reductions for Iran, Egypt, Malaysia, and Turkey.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lower relative to last month, with declines for Brazil, Iran, Mexico, China, and Argentina that are partly offset by small increases for several African countries.  Global corn ending stocks, at 296.0 million tons, are down 6.6 million. RICE:  This month\u2019s outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice is for slightly lower supplies, unchanged use, and decreased ending stocks.  The NASS November Crop Production report indicated 2019/20 rice production is lowered 0.7 million cwt from the previous forecast to 187.9 million.  Long-grain is lowered 0.5 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain is lowered 0.2 million cwt.  The average all rice yield is down 29 pounds to 7,587 pounds per acre.  The production decrease corresponds to a 0.7 million cwt decrease in all rice ending stocks.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $13.00 per cwt, up from last year\u2019s revised $12.30.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised 1.4 million tons, mainly on increased beginning stocks reflecting lower 2018/19 consumption.  Several mostly offsetting changes led to fractionally lower global production.  India production is raised 1.0 million tons due to ample water supplies and increased planting intentions of the irrigated Rabi crop.  Indonesia production is lowered 0.9 million tons due to the delayed onset of the monsoon, and the Philippines are lowered 0.2 million tons as farmers shift production to more profitable crops.  Global exports for 2019/20 are lowered fractionally led by a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Thailand as its export prices are expected to remain uncompetitive.  Partly offsetting is a 0.2-million-ton increase in India exports reflecting the larger crop, and a 0.2-million-ton increase for Vietnam on improved price competitiveness.  Global imports are down 0.5 million tons with a 0.8-million-ton increase for Indonesia more than offset by 0.6-million-ton decrease for China, a 0.4-million-ton decrease for Nigeria, and a 0.2-million-ton decrease for the Philippines.  Ending stocks are raised 2.0 million tons to a record 177.0 million.  ",
    "September_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, reduced feed and residual use, lower stocks, and higher prices.  Corn production is forecast at 15.093 billion bushels, down 61 million from last month.  Corn supplies for 2016/17 are lowered from last month but are still forecast at a record 16.859 billion bushels, as a smaller crop more than offsets a small increase in beginning stocks due to a reduction in 2015/16 exports.  Feed and residual use for 2016/17 is lowered 25 million bushels with a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  Exports are unchanged from last month, reflecting the competitiveness of U.S. corn on the world market.  Corn ending stocks are down from last month but, if realized, would still be the highest since 1987/88.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents on both ends to $2.90 to $3.50 per bushel.  Sorghum production for 2016/17 is forecast 14 million bushels above last month on higher yields.  Grain sorghum prices are projected to average $2.75 to $3.35 per bushel, raised 5 cents on each end from last month. Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast down 2.8 million tons to 1,319.7 million, but still above the record reached in 2014/15.  The 2016/17 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, slightly higher consumption, larger trade, and reduced stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is raised, as relatively favorable corn prices in southern Brazil are expected to boost first-crop planted area at the expense of soybeans.  Barley production is raised for Argentina, Australia, and Canada.  China corn production is lowered, based on drier-than-normal conditions during July and August in western Heilongjiang and eastern Inner Mongolia.  EU corn and barley production are reduced; even with lower barley production, EU internal market prices are expected to favor greater barley feeding, offsetting reduced corn feeding.  Russia barley production is down based on lower-than-expected yields for spring barley.Corn exports are raised for Brazil with larger projected supplies for the local marketing year beginning in March 2017.  Corn imports are raised for China, reflecting updated expectations of trade by non-state importers.  China\u2019s barley imports are lowered as the pace of trade has slowed in recent months, despite global feed barley prices that are well below a year ago.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are lowered 0.7 million tons from last month.  Stock declines are the largest in Argentina and the EU, with the former reflecting expectations of larger exports during 2015/16. Global corn stocks, at 219.5 million, are down from last month but still projected to be record high.RICE:  U.S. 2016/17 all rice supplies are reduced 0.6 million cwt due to a lower production forecast that is mostly offset by increased beginning stocks.  Imports are also lowered 0.5 million cwt.  All rice beginning stocks for 2016/17 are raised 7.1 million cwt from last month based on USDA\u2019s August Rice Stocks report.  All rice production is lowered 7.2 million tons on both lower area and yield.  The production estimate reflects excessive rain and flooding that has taken place in several areas of the Southern production region.  The long-grain crop is lowered 4.8 million cwt to 177.9 million, but is 44.9 million cwt above the previous year and the largest crop since the 2010/11 record.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 2.3 million cwt to 59.3 million.  Total rice exports are unchanged, but domestic and residual use is lowered 5.0 million cwt to 133.0.  Ending stocks are raised 4.4 million cwt and the all rice season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per cwt at the midpoint to a projected range of $10.20 to $11.20.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are raised 1.8 million tons on higher beginning stocks and production.  Production is raised 0.7 million tons and remains record large.  India production for 2016/17 is raised 1.5 million tons on an increase in projected harvested area; however, this is partially offset by a 0.7-million-ton reduction for Vietnam.  Global exports for 2016/17 are raised 0.3 million tons with stronger shipments from India partially offset by reduced Vietnam exports.  Global consumption for 2016/17 is lowered fractionally.  With total supplies rising and total use declining, world ending stocks are raised 1.8 million tons to 115.6 million.",
    "September_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for increased production, greater feed and residual use, higher ending stocks, and lower prices.  Corn production is forecast at 14.184 billion bushels, up 32 million from last month.  Corn supplies are up from last month, as a larger crop more than offsets a small decline in beginning stocks due to updated use estimates for 2016/17.  Feed and residual use for 2017/18 is raised 25 million bushels with a larger crop and lower expected prices.  Corn used for ethanol for 2017/18 is projected down 25 million bushels at 5.475 billion, based on observed usage during 2016/17 and expectations of lower exports.  Other industrial use is lowered 50 million bushels.  With supply increasing and use falling, corn ending stocks are up 62 million bushels from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents on both ends to a range of $2.80 to $3.60 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2017/18 is forecast up 2.4 million tons to 1,316.5 million.  The 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for greater production, slightly lower consumption, reduced trade, and larger stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast to decline relative to last month with reductions for Serbia, Ukraine, the EU, and Russia more than offsetting increases for Argentina and Mexico.  The projected corn yield for Ukraine is reduced based on heat and dryness during the month of August.  In Argentina, corn area is raised from last month and is now forecast to be record high.  Barley production is raised for Russia and Canada, but lowered for Argentina and the EU. Corn exports are lowered for Serbia and Russia, but increased for Ukraine.  Despite a smaller crop, Ukraine\u2019s relatively large exportable supplies and logistical advantages are expected to fill demand for imported corn in the EU.  Brazil\u2019s 2016/17 exports are raised for the local marketing year beginning March 2017.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2017/18 are virtually unchanged from last month, with declines for Brazil, Serbia, Ukraine, and Russia offset by increases for Argentina and Mexico.  Global corn stocks, at 202.5 million tons, are up 1.6 million from last month.RICE:  Total U.S. rice supplies are reduced 6.6 million cwt from last month due to a lower production forecast.  In the September Crop Production report, NASS reduced the 2017/18 U.S. crop size by 6.7 million cwt to 179.7 million, primarily on lower area.  NASS incorporated FSA certified acreage data this month in adjusting forecast acreage lower.  The average all rice yield also declined by 9 pounds to 7,504 pounds per acre.  Long-grain production is reduced by 5.3 million cwt and combined medium-short is decreased by 1.4 million.  The reduction in 2017/18 supplies results in both lower projected domestic use and residual and exports.  All rice ending stocks are reduced 1.1 million cwt to 29.0 million, the lowest level since 2007/08.  The 2017/18 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.50 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $12.70 to $13.70.  Prices for all rice classes are increased this month. Global 2017/18 rice supplies are increased to 603.7 million tons, primarily on higher production and beginning stocks for India.  Production increases are partly offset by reductions in China and Bangladesh.  World 2017/18 consumption is increased by 1.1 million tons to 480.2 million.  Global 2017/18 trade is raised to a record 44.2 million tons on higher exports from Burma and India.",
    "November_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.626 billion bushels, down 152 million from last month on a reduced yield forecast.  Feed and residual use is lowered 50 million bushels based on a smaller crop and higher prices. Exports are reduced 25 million bushels based on expectations of increased competition from Ukraine.  With supply falling more than use, corn ending stocks are down 77 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 10 cents to a midpoint of $3.60 per bushel. Production, domestic consumption, and ending stocks of corn for China are revised beginning with the 2007/08 marketing year.  A detailed breakout of the corn balance sheet revisions is available via at the Foreign Agricultural Service PS&D website and the WASDE historical revisions web page.  Production, domestic consumption, and ending stocks of corn for China are revised beginning with the 2007/08 marketing year.  A detailed breakout of the corn balance sheet revisions is available via at the Foreign Agricultural Service PS&D website and the WASDE historical revisions web page.  China\u2019s NBS does not publish estimates of corn stocks or consumption.  USDA\u2019s estimates of corn stocks are based on official production estimates by NBS, trade data as reported by China Customs, and other related utilization data.  For the time period encompassing the 2007/08 to 2017/18 marketing years, NBS increased corn total production by an unprecedented 266 million metric tons.  USDA raises estimates of domestic disappearance, resulting in higher stock levels that sum to an additional 149 million tons of ending stocks for the 2018/19 marketing year.  Changes to feed and residual disappearance attempt to account for, among other factors, the expected impact of the variation in soybean meal equivalent protein consumption, corn prices, availability of other energy substitutes, and residual statistical error.  Importantly, USDA\u2019s estimates of China\u2019s coarse grain imports do not change with this revision, and thus still reflect the reality that coarse grain imports, in addition to other energy substitutes, surged during a time period when the country was accumulating large stocks of corn.Global coarse grain production for 2018/19 is forecast 29.9 million tons higher to 1,373.3 million, with a greater corn production forecast for China accounting for a large portion of the increase.  Aside from China, corn production is forecast higher for Ukraine, Argentina, Kenya, Moldova, and Russia.  EU corn production is lowered, mostly reflecting reductions for Hungary, Poland, and Germany. Corn exports are raised for Ukraine, Argentina, and Moldova. Imports are raised for the EU, Vietnam, and Iran.  Barley imports are raised for Saudi Arabia, with higher exports projected for Russia and Ukraine.  Not including China, foreign corn ending stocks are higher than last month, mostly reflecting increases for Argentina, Iran, Paraguay, and Vietnam. RICE: This month\u2019s outlook for 2018/19 U.S. rice is for fractionally higher supplies, reduced exports, and higher ending stocks.  The NASS November Crop Production report indicated 2018/19 rice production is lowered slightly from the previous forecast to 218.3 million cwt with California accounting for the entire reduction.  The average all rice yield is reduced 17 pounds to 7,522 pounds per acre.  Despite lower production, supplies still increased as imports are forecast up 1.0 million cwt to a record of 28.0 million on higher medium- and short-grain imports into Puerto Rico.  The all rice export forecast is lowered 2.0 million cwt to 96.0 million with all of the reduction in long-grain on continued strong competition in Western Hemisphere markets from South American suppliers.  All rice ending stocks are increased 2.5 million cwt to 46.7 million and are 59 percent higher than 2017/18.  The projected 2018/19 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised this month $0.30 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.50 to $12.50, as a higher projected medium- and short-grain SAFP more than offsets a lower long-grain SAFP.     Global 2018/19 rice supplies are increased by 17.7 million tons to 651.4 million, mostly due to revisions for China.  USDA incorporated China\u2019s NBS rice production revisions from 2007/08 through 2017/18, which consequently raised its supplies over this multi-year period.  The cumulative increases in China\u2019s ending stocks result in the large upward adjustment in 2018/19 global supplies.  Additionally, China\u2019s 2018/19 production forecast is raised on larger harvested area, reflecting the NBS revisions for prior years.  Global consumption is fractionally lower at 488.4 million tons as reductions in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are not completely offset by increases in other countries.  World trade is lowered 0.6 million tons to 48.9 million on reduced exports for India, Argentina, and the United States.  Global ending stocks are raised 17.8 million tons to a record 163.0 million with China now accounting for 69 percent of 2018/19 world stocks, compared to 66 percent last month.  ",
    "July_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for larger production and beginning stocks, greater feed and residual use, lower food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use, and increased ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are raised 145 million bushels, reflecting lower use forecasts for 2018/19.  Exports are reduced based on current outstanding sales and shipments to date, with export inspection data for June the lowest for the month since 2013.  Feed and residual use is down based on indicated disappearance during the first three quarters of the marketing year in the June 28 Grain Stocks.  FSI is lowered with forecast declines in several categories of non-ethanol industrial use.  For 2019/20, corn production is projected 195 million bushels higher based on increased planted and harvested areas from the June 28 Acreage report.  Excessive rainfall prevented planting at the time of the Acreage survey, leaving a portion of acres still to be planted for corn in a number of major producing states.  In July, USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will collect updated information on 2019 acres planted, and if the newly collected data justify any changes, NASS will publish updated acreage estimates in the August Crop Production report.  The national average corn yield is unchanged at 166.0 bushels per acre.  Silking as reported in the Crop Progress report is behind the recent historical average, thus for much of the crop the critical pollination period will be during late July into early August.  Projected feed and residual use is raised 25 million bushels, reflecting a larger crop.  FSI is lowered 20 million bushels, reflecting lower projections for non-ethanol industrial use.  Small revisions are made to historical trade and utilization estimates based on the 13th month trade data revisions from the Census Bureau.  With supply rising more than use, stocks are raised 335 million bushels to 2.0 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $3.70 per bushel.This month\u2019s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production and trade, and slightly lower stocks relative to last month.  Ukraine corn production is raised, reflecting increased area.  Barley production is raised for Canada but lowered for Ukraine and India.  For 2018/19, Argentina corn production is higher based on harvest results to date.  Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include higher corn exports for Ukraine, with increased imports for Zimbabwe.  For 2018/19, corn exports are raised for Argentina and Brazil reflecting higher-than-expected shipments during the month of June.  Foreign corn ending stocks are virtually unchanged from last month.   RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice is for increased supplies, higher domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks.  All rice supplies are raised this month by 4.9 million cwt to 289.5 million.  All rice production increased by 10.6 million cwt to 208.7 million with long-grain production raised 12.6 million cwt on a higher harvested area than previously estimated.  Combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 2.0 million cwt on reduced harvested area.  Partly offsetting the production increase is a 5.7-million-cwt decrease in beginning stocks.  The NASS Rice Stocks report implied significantly higher domestic and residual use than previously estimated for the 2018/19 marketing year, which resulted in lower 2019/20 beginning stocks.  All rice exports for 2018/19 are also raised 2.0 million cwt (all long-grain) to 92.0 million, the result of a strong recent export pace.  Total rice use for 2019/20 is increased 6.0 million cwt to 239.0 million on a 5.0-million-cwt increase in domestic and residual use and a 1.0-million-cwt increase in exports.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.1 million cwt to 50.5 million, and the season-average farm price for all rice is raised $0.10 per cwt to $11.80.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised fractionally on both higher beginning stocks and production.  The higher 2019/20 beginning stocks stem from several 2018/19 changes including a 0.4-million-ton production decrease, a 0.9-million-ton consumption decrease, and a 0.2-million-ton increase in beginning stocks.  The small 2019/20 production increase is the result of a 0.3-million-ton increase in U.S. production that is partially offset by a 0.1-million-ton decrease for Brazil.  Global 2019/20 exports are lowered fractionally to 46.9 million tons.  With global supplies rising more than use, world ending stocks are increased 0.8 million tons to a record 172.7 million.  ",
    "June_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for increased beginning stocks and imports, sharply lower production, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are up reflecting a 100-million-bushel decline in projected exports for 2018/19 to 2.2 billion bushels, based on current outstanding sales and reduced U.S. price competitiveness.  Corn production for 2019/20 is forecast to decline 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2015/16.  Unprecedented planting delays observed through early June are expected to prevent some plantings and reduce yield prospects.  USDA will release its Acreage report on June 28, which will provide survey-based indications of planted and harvested area.  With sharply lower supplies, use is projected to decline 425 million bushels to 14.3 billion, based on reductions to feed and residual use and exports.  With supplies falling more than use, ending stocks are projected to decline 810 million bushels to 1.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14.  The season-average farm price is raised 50 cents to $3.80 per bushel.This month\u2019s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, increased trade and lower stocks relative to last month.  Argentina corn production is raised on increased area with higher prices.  Canada corn production is lowered on reductions to both area and yield with planting delays in Ontario.  Russia corn production is higher based on government data indicating larger-than-expected planted area.  Barley production is lowered for the EU reflecting a reduction for Spain.  For 2018/19, Brazil corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics. Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include larger forecast corn exports for Argentina and Russia, with a partly offsetting reduction for Zambia.  For 2018/19, exports are raised for Brazil and Argentina for the local marketing year beginning in March 2019 based on higher-than-expected shipments during May.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month mostly reflecting reductions for Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the EU. RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks.  Projected U.S. all rice production is lowered 20.1 million cwt or 9 percent to 198.1 million with all of the decrease in long-grain, primarily on a reduction in planted area.  The excessive spring precipitation in the Delta is expected to result in lower rice area in this region compared to the NASS Prospective Plantings intended acreage, issued March 29.  Partially offsetting the smaller production are higher projected imports, which are raised by 1.2 million cwt to a record large 29.2 million with increases for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain.  All rice projected domestic and residual use is lowered 7.0 million cwt to 133.0 million, mainly the result of reduced long-grain supplies.  Projected all rice exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million.  The reduction in long-grain exports on higher projected prices is partially offset by increased medium- and short-grain exports as a portion of outstanding sales from the 2018/19 market year are expected to be shifted to 2019/20.  Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 7.2 million cwt to 51.6 million with long-grain accounting for all of the reduction.  The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised by $0.50 per cwt to $11.70 with increases in the projected SAFPs of all rice classes this month.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are decreased by 0.5 million tons to 667.8 million as higher carryin stocks are more than offset by lower production.  Global production is down as reductions for the United States, North Korea, and Thailand are not completely offset by higher projected production for Madagascar, Egypt, and the EU.  World 2019/20 consumption is lowered fractionally to 496.0 million tons on reduced expected use in China, North Korea, and the United States more than offsetting higher use in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Burma, and Egypt.  Global 2019/20 trade is lowered 0.4 million tons to 47.2 million as reduced exports by India, Burma, and the United States are not completely offset by higher exports by China.  Projected world ending stocks are adjusted lower this month to 171.9 million tons but remain record large.",
    "September_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2015/16 U.S. feed grain supplies are reduced this month with lower forecast corn production more than offsetting a small increase for sorghum.  Corn production is forecast 101 million bushels lower with the national average yield expected at 167.5 bushels per acre, down 1.3 bushels from the August forecast.  A 40-million-bushel reduction in projected beginning stocks, reflecting higher expected corn food, seed, and industrial use (FSI) and exports in 2014/15, also reduces projected supplies for 2015/16.  U.S. corn usage for 2015/16 is lowered 20 million bushels, but usage is expected to be record high and just above the level projected for 2014/15.  Feed and residual use for 2015/16 is expected 25 million bushels lower with the smaller crop.  FSI use is projected 5 million bushels higher on an increase in expected use for sweeteners consistent with this month\u2019s upward revision to that usage category for 2014/15.  Despite higher projected global import demand, projected corn exports for 2015/16 are unchanged with tighter supplies.  U.S. ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected 121 million bushels lower and 140 million bushels below this month\u2019s lowered 2014/15 carryout projection.  The 2015/16 season-average corn price received by producers is projected 10 cents higher on both ends to $3.45 to $4.05 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 2.3 million tons lower as a 7.5-million-ton reduction in world corn production more than offsets a 5.3-million-ton increase in world barley output.  Much of the decline in global corn production reflects a 4.3-million-ton reduction in EU corn and this month\u2019s lower U.S. production, but small reductions are also made for the Philippines, Moldova, Serbia, and Thailand.  Barley production is raised for Russia, EU, Canada, Turkey, and Ukraine.Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is raised slightly, mostly on higher expected barley consumption for EU and Saudi Arabia.  Global corn consumption is lowered 2.3 million tons with the reduction in U.S. feed and residual use and lower corn feeding expected in EU.  Higher EU barley and wheat feeding more than offset reductions for corn and oats.  EU corn imports are raised 1.0 million tons.  Global corn imports for 2015/16 are raised 2.0 million tons as increases for Vietnam, Mexico, and the Philippines combine with that for EU.  Corn exports for 2015/16 are raised for Ukraine.  A 1.0-million-ton increase in 2014/15 Brazil corn exports, reflecting higher expected shipments through February 2016, also helps meet higher expected global corn import demand resulting from the crop short-fall in EU during the 2015/16 marketing year.  Global 2015/16 corn ending stocks are projected 5.4 million tons lower at 189.7 million, 7.5 million lower than for 2014/15.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 rice supplies are lowered 14.9 million cwt from last month resulting from a decrease in production that is partially offset by a slight increase in beginning stocks.  Imports are unchanged.  U.S. rice production for 2015/16 is forecast at 189.5 million cwt, down 15.5 million from last month due to a decrease in both area harvested and yield.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.57 million acres, down 174,000 from last month.  Harvested area estimates are lowered for all states except California.  The average all rice yield is estimated at 7,374 pounds per acre, down 98 pounds per acre from last month, with decreases in all states except Mississippi.  Long-grain rice production is forecast at 131.5 million cwt, down 17.5 million from last month, and combined medium- and short-grain production is forecast at 58.0 million cwt, up 2.0 million.  All rice beginning stocks for 2015/16 are raised 0.7 million cwt from last month to 48.5 million (rough-equivalent basis) based on USDA\u2019s August Rice Stocks report.  All rice 2015/16 domestic consumption and residual is lowered 4.0 million cwt to 125.0 million due mainly to lower supplies.  Exports are forecast at 97.0 million cwt, down 10.0 million from last month with long-grain exports down 10.0 million, but medium- and short-grain unchanged.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 0.9 million cwt to 41.5 million.The 2015/16 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $12.80 to $13.80 per cwt, up $1.30 per cwt on both ends of the range from last month compared to $11.90 per cwt for 2014/15.  The all medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.50 to $18.50 per cwt, down 30 cents per cwt on both ends of the range from last month compared to $17.90 per cwt for 2014/15.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price, at a midpoint of $21.00 per cwt, is unchanged from last month.  The Other States medium-and short-grain rice price, at a midpoint of $14.50 per cwt, is lowered 30 cents per cwt.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $14.20 to $15.20 per cwt, up 80 cents per cwt from a month ago compared to a revised $13.20 per cwt for 2014/15.Projected global 2015/16 rice ending stocks are reduced on lower supplies.  Global rice production is projected at 475.8 million tons, down 2.9 million from last month, primarily due to smaller crops forecast for Burma, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, and the United States.  This is the first year-to-year decrease in production since 2009/10.  Burma\u2019s crop is lowered due to significant widespread flooding in late July through mid-August.  China\u2019s crop is lowered based mostly on early rice crop production data released by the government of China.  Egypt\u2019s rice crop is lowered due to prolonged excessive heat during the growing season.  Indonesia\u2019s crop is lowered due to a downward adjustment in expected yield.  The Philippines crop is lowered due to a decrease in area and expected yield.  Global beginning stocks are raised 1.8 million tons, due mostly to an increase in India.  India\u2019s 2014/15 rice crop is raised 2.3 million tons based on data released by the government of India.  India\u2019s exports for 2015/16 are raised 0.5 million tons to 9.0 million, partially offset by a reduction of 0.4 million for Burma to 1.8 million.  Global 2015/16 rice consumption is lowered slightly from last month.  Global 2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 90.2 million tons, down 0.7 million from last month, and a decline of 11.7 million from the previous year.  Ending stocks are lowered for Burma, China, Egypt, Indonesia, and the Philippines; and raised for India and Vietnam.",
    "September_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2014/15 U.S. feed grain supplies are raised this month with higher forecast corn production.  Corn production for 2014/15 is forecast 363 million bushels higher at a record 14,395 million bushels.  The corn yield forecast is raised 4.3 bushels per acre to a record 171.7 bushels.  Corn supplies for 2014/15 are projected at 15,607 million bushels, up 826 million bushels from the previous record in 2013/14.  Total 2014/15 corn usage is projected at 13,605 million bushels, up 170 million from last month.  Although a record, usage is expected up just 5 million bushels from 2013/14 as export prospects remain constrained by large foreign carryin stocks.  Feed and residual use for 2014/15 is projected 75 million bushels higher this month with the larger crop and lower prices.  Projected food, seed, and industrial use is raised 70 million bushels with increases expected for both ethanol and sweeteners.  Increases are supported by the reduced corn price outlook and higher production of these corn-based products in recent months.  Corn exports are projected 25 million bushels higher with lower prices and reduced competition expected from South America later in the marketing year.  Projected U.S. corn ending stocks are raised 194 million bushels to 2,002 million and would be the highest since 2004/05.  The projected season-average corn farm price is lowered 40 cents at the midpoint to $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel.Other notable supply and use changes this month include higher projected sorghum exports for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 and an increase in expected barley imports.  The 2014/15 season-average farm price for sorghum is projected 35 cents lower at the midpoint to $3.00 to $3.60 per bushel, but the price outlooks for barley and oats are raised reflecting higher-than-expected prices for malting barley and oats reported during the summer months of their June-May marketing year.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 4.0 million tons higher, despite a 7.9-million-ton reduction in foreign coarse grain production.  In addition to the higher forecast U.S. corn production, higher foreign beginning stocks also offset the reduction in foreign output.  Most of the increase in beginning stocks reflects lower 2013/14 EU corn and barley use and higher corn imports.  Adding to available EU grain supplies for 2014/15 is a combined increase of 2.1 million tons in corn and barley output.  Brazil corn production is also raised 1.0 million tons for 2014/15 with a month-to-month increase in expected area reflecting the higher area and production reported for 2013/14.  Serbia corn production is raised 0.3 million tons for 2014/15.Corn production for 2014/15 is reduced elsewhere with the largest reduction for China where output is expected down 5 million tons based on persistent summer dryness in key growing areas of the North China Plain and Northeast.  Argentina corn production is lowered 3.0 million tons for 2014/15 with lower expected plantings, but higher reported yields boost 2013/14 production 1.0 million tons.  Hot, dry conditions in Ukraine and Russia reduce 2014/15 corn production prospects by 1.0 million tons and 0.5 million tons, respectively.  Other coarse grain production changes for 2014/15 include a 0.6-million-ton reduction in Argentina sorghum and a 0.5-million-ton reduction in Argentina barley.  Barley production is also reduced for Algeria, Australia, and Azerbaijan.  A 0.8-million-ton increase in Ukraine barley and a 0.2-million-ton increase in Canada barley, combined with the higher EU output, boost global barley production 0.5 million tons.Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised 2.3 million tons as higher U.S. consumption is partly offset by a reduction in foreign corn use.  Higher expected corn exports for the United States, EU, and Serbia mostly offset an expected reduction for Argentina.  Higher 2013/14 Argentina and Brazil local marketing-year (March 2014-February 2015) exports are expected to limit opportunities for U.S. exports during the early months of the 2014/15 U.S. marketing year (September-August); however, lower year-to-year 2014/15 production and exports for Argentina and Brazil are expected to reduce competition for U.S. shipments during the second half of the 2014/15 September-August marketing year.  Global corn ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected 2.1 million tons higher with reductions for China, Argentina, and Russia more than offset by the larger stocks for the United States and Brazil.RICE:  U.S. 2014/15 rice supplies are lowered 11.5 million cwt because of declines in both beginning stocks and production, while imports are unchanged from a month ago.  U.S. rice production for 2014/15 is forecast at 218.3 million cwt, down 10.5 million from last month due both to a decrease in area harvested and yield.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.91 million acres, down 116,000 from last month.  Harvested area estimates are lowered for Arkansas and California; raised in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; and unchanged in Missouri.  Medium-grain harvested area in California is lowered 65,000 acres to 390,000 acres, down 120,000 acres from last year.  The average all rice yield is estimated at 7,501 pounds per acre, down 59 pounds per acre from last month, with decreases in Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, partially offset by an increase in California.  Long-grain rice production is forecast at 158.3 million cwt, down 11.1 million from last month, and combined medium- and short-grain production is forecast at 60.0 million cwt, up 0.6 million.  All rice beginning stocks for 2014/15 are lowered 0.9 million cwt from last month to 31.8 million (rough equivalent basis) based on USDA\u2019s August Rice Stocks report.  All rice 2014/15 domestic consumption and residual is lowered 3.0 million cwt to 131.0 million due mainly to lower supplies.  Exports are forecast at 102.0 million cwt, down 7 million from last month.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.5 million cwt to 38.1 million.All rice domestic and residual use for 2013/14 is raised 1.9 million cwt to 124.9 million, up 5.3 percent from 2012/13 based mostly on the ending stocks data.  The 2013/14 export projection is lowered 0.8 million cwt to 92.7 million based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau for the full marketing year.The 2014/15 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $12.50 to $13.50 per cwt, up 50 cents per cwt on both ends of the range from last month compared to $15.40 per cwt for 2013/14.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.25 to $18.25 per cwt, down 25 cents per cwt on both ends of the range from last month compared to a revised $18.50 per cwt for 2013/14.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $13.90 to $14.90 per cwt, up 10 cents per cwt from a month ago compared to $16.10 per cwt for 2013/14.Projected global 2014/15 rice ending stocks are reduced slightly on lower supplies.  Global rice production is projected at a record 477.0 million tons, down 0.4 million from last month, primarily due to smaller crops forecast for North and South Korea and the United States.  Global beginning stocks are lowered slightly, due mostly to a reduction in Thailand.  The Thailand 2013/14 export forecast is raised 0.5 million tons to 9.5 million.  Global 2014/15 rice consumption is lowered a little from last month.  Global exports are lowered slightly from a month ago on a decrease for the United States, which is partially offset by increases for Australia and Guyana.  Global 2014/15 ending stocks are projected at 105.1 million tons, down 268,000 tons from last month, and a decline of 4.8 million from the previous year.  Ending stocks are lowered for Thailand, South Korea, and the United States and raised for Australia, Guyana, and India.",
    "June_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced beginning stocks, lower feed and residual use, greater corn used for ethanol production, and lower ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are down largely reflecting a 75-million-bushel increase in projected exports for 2017/18 to 2.300 billion bushels, which if realized would be the highest since 2007/08.  Exports during the month of April were record high, besting the prior monthly shipment record set in November 1989.  Export inspection data for the month of May implies continued robust global demand for U.S. corn, while old crop outstanding sales at this point in the marketing year are record high.  Projected 2018/19 corn used for ethanol is raised 50 million bushels, offsetting a 50-million-bushel reduction in food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use of sorghum.  Corn feed and residual use is lowered 25 million bushels with increased ethanol by-product production and higher expected prices.  With supply falling and use rising, ending stocks are lowered 105 million bushels to 1.577 billion bushels, which if realized, would be the lowest level since 2013/14.  The season-average farm price is raised 10 cents at the midpoint with a range of $3.40 to $4.40 per bushel.The 2018/19 U.S. sorghum outlook is for a 50-million-bushel increase in forecast exports offset by reduced FSI use.  Exports are raised reflecting expectations of China\u2019s demand for U.S. sorghum, based on the announcement by The Ministry of Commerce May 18 terminating the anti-dumping and subsidy investigation on imported sorghum originating from the United States. This month\u2019s 2018/19 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, reduced trade and lower stocks relative to last month.  Russia corn production is down based on government data indicating lower-than-expected planted area.  Barley production is reduced for Ukraine, India, and the EU, but raised for Argentina.  For 2017/18, Brazil corn production is lowered, as below-normal rainfall in the Center-West and South during May reduces yield prospects for second-crop corn.  Area is also reduced based on the latest government statistics. Major global trade changes for 2018/19 include lower forecast corn exports for Russia, with reductions in corn imports for Vietnam, Iran, and Algeria.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for the EU, Brazil, and Vietnam that more than offset increases for Ukraine and South Africa. RICE:  U.S. 2017/18 rice ending stocks are raised 3.0 million cwt this month on a 1.0-million-cwt increase in imports and a 2.0-million-cwt decrease in exports.  Both changes reflect the pace of trade to date.  The import increase is primarily for long-grain aromatics from Asia.  The entire export reduction was medium- and short-grain and is now projected at the lowest level in more than a decade.  The 2017/18 season-average farm price for all rice is lowered $0.10 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $12.30 to $12.70.  Total supplies for 2018/19 are raised 4.0 million cwt on increased beginning stocks and imports.  Domestic and residual usage is raised 1.0 million cwt on larger supplies.  Exports are raised 2.0 million cwt following the unusually low medium- and short-grain sales from the previous market year.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are raised 1.0 million cwt and prices are unchanged.  Global supplies for 2018/19 are lowered 2.1 million tons primarily on reduced China production.  China\u2019s harvested area is decreased 0.5 million hectares and production is down 2.3 million tons.  The reduced China supplies are accounted for by a 1.0-million-ton reduction in consumption and a 1.3-million-ton decrease in stocks.  Global consumption is lowered 0.6 million tons and exports are raised fractionally.  With reduced supplies more than offsetting lower use, global ending stocks are down 1.5 million tons.  ",
    "July_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, greater feed and residual use, increased exports, and lower ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are lowered 75 million bushels as higher forecast exports and food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use more than offset lower feed and residual use in 2017/18.  Increased 2017/18 exports are based on record-high shipments during the month of May and export inspection data for June.  Current outstanding export sales are also record high.  FSI use is raised as a projected 25-million-bushel increase in the amount of corn used for ethanol, based on reported use to date, is partially offset by a decline in the amount of corn used for glucose and dextrose.  Feed and residual use is lower based on indicated disappearance during the first three quarters of the marketing year in the June 29 Grain Stocks report.  For 2018/19, corn production is forecast 190 million bushels higher based on increased planted and harvested areas from the June 29 Acreage report.  The national average corn yield is unchanged at 174.0 bushels per acre.  During June, harvested-area weighted precipitation for the major corn producing states was above normal.  While silking, as reported in the Crop Progress report, is ahead of the recent historical average, for much of the crop, the critical pollination period will be during middle and late July.  Projected feed and residual use for 2018/19 is raised 75 million bushels, mostly reflecting a larger crop and a forecast reduction in the amount of corn used to produce ethanol.  FSI use is lowered 60 million bushels based on a 50-million-bushel reduction in the forecast amount of corn used to produce ethanol, and a 10-million-bushel decline in amount of corn used for glucose and dextrose.  Exports are raised 125 million bushels based on expectations of reduced competition from Argentina, Brazil, and Russia.  Small revisions are made to historical trade and utilization estimates based on the 13th month trade data revisions from the Census Bureau.  With use rising more than supply, stocks are lowered 25 million bushels to 1.552 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint for a range of $3.30 to $4.30 per bushel.Oat production is virtually unchanged and barley production is up 8 million bushels reflecting area adjustments in the Acreage report and higher barley and lower oat yields in today\u2019s Crop Production report.  Sorghum production is raised based on the higher area reported in the Acreage report.This month\u2019s 2018/19 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, trade, and stocks relative to last month.  Russia corn production is lowered, reflecting reductions to both area and yield.  Extreme heat and dryness in the Southern and North Caucasus districts during the month of June is expected to reduce yield prospects.  Corn production is raised for the EU, but lowered for Canada.  Barley production is reduced for Russia, Australia, and the EU, but raised for Canada.  For 2017/18, Brazil corn production is reduced based on the latest government statistics.  Major global trade changes for 2018/19 include lower corn exports for Russia, more than offset by increased exports for the United States.  Corn imports are raised for South Korea and Saudi Arabia, but lowered for Japan and Mexico.  Sorghum imports are lowered for China, but partially offset by increases for Mexico and Japan.  For 2017/18, corn exports are lowered for Argentina and Brazil.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month, with the largest declines for China, the EU, and Mexico.   RICE: U.S. 2018/19 all rice supplies are increased this month by 4.8 million cwt to 272.3 million as higher production more than offsets reduced beginning stocks.  Rice production increased by 9.8 million cwt to 213.0 million as the NASS Acreage report indicated greater rice area for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain than previously forecast.  The NASS Rice Stocks report implied significantly higher than previously estimated domestic use and residual for the 2017/18 marketing year, which resulted in lower 2018/19 beginning stocks.  Total rice use for 2018/19 is increased 4.0 million cwt to 230.0 million, all on higher projected domestic and residual use.  All rice exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 102.0 million with medium- and short-grain accounting for the reduction.  Projected 2018/19 all rice ending stocks are raised to 42.3 million cwt, up 31 percent from last year with long-grain comprising most of the increase.  The 2018/19 all rice season-average farm price is reduced $0.30 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.60 to $12.60.  Global 2018/19 rice supplies are raised fractionally on increased production for the United States and Vietnam more than offsetting reductions in Australia, South Korea, and Russia.  World exports, while still a record, are modestly lower this month as reductions for India and Australia are not completely offset by higher exports for Vietnam and Pakistan.  Global ending stocks are raised by 0.6 million tons to 143.8 million, almost entirely due to a nearly 1.0 million increase for India. ",
    "July_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is for sharply lower supplies, reduced feed and residual use, increased food, seed, and industrial use, and lower ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are raised 145 million bushels, based on lower use forecasts for 2019/20.  Feed and residual use for 2019/20 is lower based on indicated disappearance during the first three quarters of the marketing year as reported in the June 30 Grain Stocks.  Food, seed, and industrial use is lowered 45 million bushels.  Corn used for ethanol is lowered 50 million bushels based on reported use to date and weekly ethanol production data reported by the Energy Information Administration during the month of June and into early July.  Projected corn used for glucose and dextrose and starch are both raised, while that used for high fructose corn syrup is lowered.  For 2020/21, corn production is forecast 995 million bushels lower based on reduced planted and harvested areas from the June 30 Acreage report.  The national average corn yield is unchanged at 178.5 bushels per acre.  During June, harvested-area weighted precipitation for the major corn producing states as reported by the National Centers for Environmental Information was below normal, but did not represent an extreme deviation from the 1988 to 2019 average.  Silking as reported in the Crop Progress report is slower than the recent historical average and for much of the crop the critical pollination period will be during middle and late July.  Projected feed and residual use is lowered 200 million bushels, reflecting a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  Food, seed, and industrial use is raised 25 million bushels, based on projected increases in the amount of corn used for beverage and manufacturing, starch, and glucose and dextrose.  Small revisions are made to historical trade and utilization estimates based on the 13th month trade data revisions from the Census Bureau.  With supply declining more than use, stocks are lowered 675 million bushels to 2.6 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 15 cents to $3.35 per bushel.This month\u2019s 2020/21 foreign coarse grain outlook is for virtually unchanged production, slightly higher trade, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is virtually unchanged from last month, as forecast increases for Russia and Bolivia are essentially offset by a reduction for Canada.  Barley production is lowered for the EU and Morocco but raised for Canada.  Major global trade changes for 2020/21 include larger corn imports for Canada and Algeria, with a partly offsetting reduction for Kenya.  For 2019/20, corn exports are raised for Argentina but lowered for Brazil for the local marketing year beginning March 2020 based on observed data through early July.  China\u2019s corn feed and residual use for 2019/20 and 2020/21 is raised from last month, based on a faster-than-expected rebound in soybean meal equivalent protein consumption and current corn prices.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are lowered from last month, with the largest declines for China, Argentina, the EU, Canada, and Mexico.RICE:  The outlook for both 2019/20 and 2020/21 U.S. rice is for increased supplies, higher domestic use, and lower exports while ending stocks are reduced for 2019/20 and increased for 2020/21.  All rice supplies for 2020/21 are raised 3.5 million cwt this month based on a 4.5-million-cwt production increase and a 1.0-million-cwt import increase, which are partially offset by a 2.0-million-cwt reduction in beginning stocks.  The NASS Rice Stocks report, and surging imports, implied significantly higher domestic and residual use than previously estimated for 2019/20.  Imports for both 2019/20 and 2020/21 are raised to record-high levels, primarily reflecting strong demand for imported Asian aromatic varieties.  Long-grain production for 2020/21 is raised 6.3 million cwt to 161.8 million on increased planted acreage, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 1.8 million to 58.9 million on reduced area, based on the June 30 NASS Acreage report.  Rising domestic and residual use is expected to continue in 2020/21.  Exports for 2019/20 are lowered 1.5 million cwt on continued uncompetitive prices for U.S. long grain as well as recent cancelations of outstanding sales; 2020/21 exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt (though still up 3.5 million cwt from the previous market year) on expectations of continued strong international competition for long grain exports.  All rice ending stocks for 2020/21 are raised 0.5 million cwt to 43.8 million and the season-average farm price for all rice is lowered $0.20 per cwt to $12.70.  Global 2020/21 rice supplies are raised fractionally on higher beginning stocks and production.  The higher 2020/21 beginning stocks stem from several 2019/20 changes including a 0.9-million-ton production increase that is only partially offset by increased domestic and residual use.  Global 2020/21 production and domestic use are each raised 0.5 million tons, and both remain record high.  With supplies rising more than use, global 2020/21 ending stocks are a record high 185.8 million tons with China and India respectively holding 63 percent and 21 percent.  ",
    "June_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is little changed from last month, with fractional increases to beginning and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are raised, as a 45-million-bushel reduction in estimated production for 2019/20 is largely offset by a 50-million-bushel reduction in projected corn used for ethanol.  Corn used for ethanol is lowered reflecting a slower-than-expected rebound in ethanol production as indicated by Energy Information Administration data during the month of May and into early June.  For 2020/21, with supply up slightly and no changes to projected use, ending stocks are 5 million bushels higher at 3.3 billion bushels.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $3.20 per bushel.The global coarse grain production forecast for 2020/21 is raised 3.2 million tons to 1,484.6 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, increased use, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is raised based on higher expected area.  Barley production is raised for the EU, based mostly on a forecast increase for the United Kingdom that is partly offset by a reduction for France.  Barley production is raised for Australia, but lowered for Ukraine, India, and Russia.  For 2019/20, Brazil corn production is unchanged, as higher indicated area is offset by a reduction in yield.  Yield prospects for much of the Center-West are generally favorable in contrast to the South where conditions have been poor. Major global trade changes for 2020/21 include a larger corn export forecast for Zambia, with increases in corn imports for Thailand and Honduras.  Barley exports are lowered for Australia, based on a reduction in projected imports for China.  For 2019/20, corn exports are raised for Argentina but lowered for Brazil for the local marketing year beginning March 2020 based on observed data through early June.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are lowered from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for China, Argentina, South Africa, and Paraguay that more than offset increases for Brazil and India.RICE: The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for larger supplies, greater domestic use, reduced exports, and increased ending stocks.  Most of the 2020/21 revisions are the result of 2019/20 supply and use changes.  The 2020/21 all rice beginning stocks are increased 1.5 million cwt to 32.0 million, a result of higher 2019/20 imports, now forecast at a near-record 33.5 million, raising 2019/20 ending stocks.  All of the increase in 2019/20 imports is for long-grain, based on a record import pace to date, primarily aromatics from Thailand.  Long-term growth in imports is expected to continue in 2020/21 as projected imports are raised 1.0 million cwt to a record-high 33.6 million.  The combination of increased beginning stocks and higher imports raises 2020/21 total supplies by 2.5 million cwt to 281.8 million.  Total 2019/20 domestic use and residual is raised 2.0 million cwt to 135.0 million, based on the higher import forecast.  Similarly, total 2020/21 domestic use is also raised by 2.0 million cwt to 139.5 million, based on higher imports.  Total 2019/20 exports are lowered by 2.0 million cwt to 96.0 million, all for long-grain as the U.S. is becoming increasingly uncompetitive as the marketing year nears completion.  Total 2020/21 exports are reduced by 1.0 million cwt to 99.0 million, all based on lower long-grain exports as the U.S. is expected to remain uncompetitive early in the marketing year.  Projected 2020/21 all rice ending stocks are raised 1.5 million cwt to 43.3 million, up 35 percent from the 2019/20 revised ending stocks.  The 2020/21 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is unchanged at $12.90 per cwt, compared to the upwardly revised 2019/20 SAFP of $13.10.  The 2020/21 global outlook is for larger supplies, fractionally lower consumption and trade, and increased stocks.  Supplies are raised by 1.0 million tons to a record 683.3 million, mainly on higher beginning stocks for China and Thailand.  World production is only fractionally higher at 502.1 million tons as increases for Brazil and Nigeria are almost completely offset by a reduction for Vietnam, with global production remaining record high.  World 2020/21 consumption is lowered by 0.1 million tons to 498.0 million, still a record, as decreases for Vietnam and Philippines are not completely offset by increases for Brazil, China, Nigeria, and the U.S.  Global trade is reduced 0.3 million tons to 44.9 million, primarily on lower exports from Vietnam and China.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are raised 1.2 million tons to a record high of 185.4 million with China accounting for 63 percent of the total.",
    "November_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for higher production, larger feed and residual use, and greater ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 13.930 billion bushels, up 35 million from last month on a 0.4-bushel increase in yield to 172.3 bushels per acre.  Feed and residual use is higher based on a larger crop.  With supply rising more than use, corn ending stocks are raised 10 million bushels.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $6.80 per bushel.  Global coarse grain production for 2022/23 is forecast fractionally lower at 1,459.5 million tons.  This month\u2019s 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for reduced production, lower trade, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast lower as declines for the EU, South Africa, Philippines, and Nigeria are partly offset by increases for Angola, Mali, Pakistan, Turkey, and Senegal.  Corn production in the EU is down based on a decline for Hungary.  South Africa is reduced based on lower expected area.  Barley production is lowered for Argentina but raised for Australia and the EU.  Major global trade changes include lower corn exports for South Africa.  Corn imports are reduced for Vietnam, Algeria, and Turkey.  For 2021/22, corn exports for Argentina are cut for the local marketing year beginning March 2022, based on shipments observed through October.  For 2022/23, barley exports are raised for Australia but lowered for Argentina and Russia.  Barley imports are reduced for China.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down, mostly reflecting declines for Nigeria and South Africa that are partly offset by an increase for Vietnam.  Global corn ending stocks, at 300.8 million tons, are down 0.4 million. RICE:  The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for nearly unchanged supplies, higher domestic use, reduced exports, and larger ending stocks.  Supplies are fractionally lower as reduced production is not completely offset by higher imports.  The NASS November Crop Production report reduced 2022/23 all rice production 1.1 million cwt to 164.3 million, all on lower yields.  The average all rice yield is down 50 pounds per acre to 7,549 pounds.  This is the lowest U.S. rice production since 1993/94.  Imports are raised 1.0 million cwt (all long-grain) to a record 45.0 million with strong demand for Thai and Indian rice.  Total domestic and residual use is also raised 1.0 million cwt (all long-grain) to 142.0 million on higher consumption of imported fragrant rice.  All rice exports are lowered 4.0 million to 71.0 million cwt with 3.0 million of the reduction for long-grain on lagging shipments to the leading U.S. markets of Mexico and Haiti.  All rice exports would be the lowest since 1991/92 as the United States continues to be uncompetitive in several key markets.  All rice ending stocks are raised 2.9 million cwt to 36.1 million but are still down 9 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price for all rice is raised $0.50 per cwt to a record $19.90, all on higher medium- and short-grain price forecasts, with the long-grain price unchanged.The 2022/23 global outlook is for lower supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks this month.  Supplies are reduced 2.5 million tons to 686.8 million, on lower beginning stocks for India and smaller production for Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka.  India\u2019s beginning stocks are reduced 1.0 million tons on higher exports and domestic consumption for 2021/22.  Pakistan\u2019s 2022/23 production is lowered 0.8 million tons to 6.6 million on heavy flooding in the Sindh region expected to reduce yields.  This would be Pakistan\u2019s lowest production since 2012/13.  World 2022/23 consumption is lowered 0.3 million tons to 517.8 million on reductions for Pakistan and India.  Global trade is reduced 0.4 million tons to 52.8 million as lower Pakistan exports are not completely offset by higher India exports.  Projected world ending stocks are reduced 2.2 million tons to 169.0 million, primarily on reductions for India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.",
    "June_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced beginning and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are down 150 million bushels reflecting projected increases for 2020/21 in corn used for ethanol and exports.  Corn used for ethanol is raised 75 million bushels based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report, and weekly ethanol production and refiner and blender net inputs data during May which indicate demand is almost back to levels seen prior to COVID-19.  Exports are raised 75 million bushels, based on export inspection data for the month of May that implies continued robust global demand for U.S. corn, despite high prices.  With no use changes for 2021/22, ending stocks are lowered 150 million bushels. The season-average farm price received by producers is unchanged at $5.70 per bushel.This month\u2019s 2021/22 foreign coarse grain outlook is for greater production, marginally higher trade, and larger ending stocks relative to last month.  Barley production is raised for the EU, mostly reflecting forecast increases for Germany and France that are partly offset by a reduction for Spain.  Barley production is also lowered for Turkey.  Brazil corn production for 2020/21 is reduced on lower yield expectations for second-crop corn, based on below-normal rainfall in the Center-West and South during the month of May.  Partly offsetting is greater indicated area for the second and third crops. Major global trade changes for 2021/22 include larger forecast barley exports for the EU with increased imports for China.  For 2020/21, Brazil\u2019s corn exports are lowered for the marketing year beginning March 2021.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2021/22 are raised relative to last month, mostly reflecting increases for Pakistan and South Africa that are partly offset by a reduction for Canada.   RICE: The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for smaller supplies, unchanged domestic use and exports, and reduced ending stocks.  All of the 2021/22 changes are the result of 2020/21 trade revisions.  The 2021/22 all rice beginning stocks are reduced 2.0 million cwt to 40.9 million, due to a combination of lower imports and higher exports for 2020/21.  All rice 2020/21 imports are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 34.7 million on reduced volumes from Asia in recent months.  All rice 2020/21 exports are raised 1.0 million cwt to 92.0 million, primarily on increased export sales and shipments to Venezuela.  Both of these trade changes are for long-grain.  Since there are no other 2021/22 supply changes and no changes to the use categories, 2021/22 projected ending stocks are reduced by 2.0 million cwt to 39.0 million.  The 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at $14.20 per cwt, compared to $13.90 for 2020/21, which is also unchanged this month.   The 2021/22 global outlook is for larger supplies, higher consumption and trade, and increased stocks.  Supplies are raised by 1.6 million tons to 682.9 million, primarily on a combination of higher beginning stocks for China and Bangladesh and increased production for India.  World production is raised to a record 506.6 million tons, mainly on higher production for India, as its harvested area is expected to remain at the same level as 2020/21, which was also raised this month.  World 2021/22 consumption is raised by 1.2 million tons to a record 514.5 million, mainly on India\u2019s increased supplies.  Global 2021/22 trade is raised 0.5 million tons to 47.0 million, primarily on higher exports by India.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are raised 0.4 million tons to 168.4 million with China accounting for 65 percent of the total.",
    "July_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, greater feed and residual use, increased exports, and higher ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are lowered 25 million bushels, based on greater feed and residual use for 2020/21 as indicated in the June 30 Grain Stocks report.  Corn production for 2021/22 is forecast 175 million bushels higher based on greater planted and harvested area from the June 30 Acreage report.  The national average corn yield is unchanged at 179.5 bushels per acre.  During June, harvested-area weighted precipitation for the major corn producing states was below normal but did not represent an extreme deviation from the 1988 to 2020 average.  For much of the crop the critical pollination period will be during middle and late July and USDA will provide its first survey-based corn yield forecast of the season in the August 12 Crop Production report.Total U.S. corn use for 2021/22 is forecast 75 million bushels higher with increases for feed and residual use and exports.  Feed and residual use is raised reflecting a larger crop.  Corn exports are raised 50 million bushels, with sharply lower exports expected for Brazil.  With supply rising more than use, ending stocks are up 75 million bushels.  The season-average farm price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $5.60 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2021/22 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production and use, larger trade, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is higher, with a projected increase for Russia based on higher indicated area.  Barley production is raised for Australia but lowered for Canada, the EU, Russia, Kazakhstan, and India.  For 2020/21, foreign corn production is lowered, with reductions for Brazil and Paraguay more than offsetting an increase for Argentina.  Major global trade changes for 2021/22 include larger corn exports for the United States and Russia with a reduction for Mexico.  Corn imports are lowered for the EU and Iran.  For 2020/21, corn exports are raised for Argentina but lowered for Brazil for the local marketing year beginning March 2021.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2021/22 are virtually unchanged from last month.   RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for slightly larger supplies, lower domestic use, higher exports, and larger ending stocks.  Supplies are raised slightly as increased beginning stocks and imports more than offset lower production.  Beginning stocks are higher, primarily due to lower estimates for domestic use and residual for 2020/21, as implied by the latest NASS Rice Stocks report.  Domestic use is also reduced in 2021/22 by 3.0 million cwt to 153.0 million, although still a record.  All rice production is reduced 2 percent to 199.3 million cwt with all the decline occurring in medium- and short-grain.  The severe drought in California reduced medium- and short-grain area as reported in NASS Acreage.  The all rice yield is also lowered based on less California area, which consistently achieves higher yields than the southern rice producing States.  Because of reduced supplies of medium- and short-grain, imports for these classes are raised to a record 8.0 million cwt which increased all rice imports to a record at 39.0 million.  All rice exports are raised 2.0 million cwt to 90.0 million (all long-grain) on expectations the United States will continue its recent expansion of rough rice exports to Venezuela and other Latin American markets.  Projected 2021/22 all rice ending stocks are raised by 2.3 million cwt to 41.3 million with long-grain accounting for all the increase.  The 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price is increased $0.20 per cwt to $14.40, all on higher medium- and short-grain prices expected for California and Other States.  The 2021/22 global outlook is for reduced supplies, lower consumption, marginally higher trade, and decreased ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced by 2.0 million tons to 681.0 million, primarily on a combination of lower beginning stocks for India and decreased production for Egypt, EU, and United States.  India\u2019s beginning stocks are reduced as its 2020/21 exports are raised 2.0 million tons to a record 19.0 million on a continued robust pace and very competitive export prices.  World 2021/22 consumption is reduced by 0.6 million tons to a still record 514.0 million.  Global 2021/22 trade is raised 0.1 million tons to 47.1 million, on higher exports by the United States, Brazil, and Australia.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are reduced by 1.4 million tons to 167.0 million, primarily on India as its stocks are at a 4-year low.  ",
    "November_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, reduced feed and residual use, larger exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.507 billion bushels, down 215 million with a reduction in yield to 175.8 bushels per acre.  Corn exports are raised 325 million bushels to 2.650 billion, which if realized would be record high.  Projected feed and residual use is lowered 75 million bushels based on a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  With supply falling and use increasing, corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are down 465 million bushels to 1.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14.  The corn price is raised 40 cents to $4.00 per bushel.Global coarse grain production for 2020/21 is forecast down 11.1 million tons to 1,447.8\t million.  The 2020/21 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, virtually unchanged use, and greater stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast lower with reductions for Ukraine, the EU, Russia, and Moldova more than offsetting increases for South Africa and Laos.  For Ukraine, the projected corn yield is lowered based on continued poor harvest results to date and if realized would be the lowest since 2012/13. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2020/21 include larger corn exports for the United States, Turkey, and South Africa, with mostly offsetting reductions for Ukraine and Russia.  Corn imports are raised for China and South Korea, but lowered for the EU, Mexico, and Iran.  For China, while the National Development and Reform Commission has not made any public statements indicating additional corn import quota has been allocated, shipment data for exporting countries through early November indicates they will exceed their tariff rate quota level of 7.2 million tons.  Barley exports are raised for the EU, with higher imports forecast for China.  Total coarse grain imports for China are forecast to reach a record 26 million tons, just above the previous high of 25.7 million reached during 2014/15. Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are higher, mostly reflecting increases for China and South Africa that are partly offset by reductions for the EU and Russia.  Global corn ending stocks, at 291.4 million tons, are down 9.0 million from last month.RICE: The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for decreased supplies, unchanged domestic use, lower exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered as NASS decreased the all rice production forecast by 0.2 million cwt to 226.1 million, all on lower yields.  The all rice yield is forecast at 7,560 pounds per acre, down 7 pounds from the previous forecast.  Exports are reduced by 2.0 million cwt to 97.0 million on the slow pace of sales and shipments in the early part of the marketing year (MY) with all the reduction for long-grain.  Projected 2020/21 all rice ending stocks are raised 1.8 million cwt to 49.5 million, up 72 percent from last year.  The projected 2020/21 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per cwt to $12.90 with increases in both the long-grain and medium- and short-grain prices.  These increases are based on NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the remainder of the MY. The 2020/21 global outlook is for higher supplies, lower consumption, trade nearly unchanged, and increased stocks.  Rice supplies are raised 0.4 million tons to 679.0 million, primarily on increased beginning stocks for Iraq, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  World production for 2020/21 is lowered 0.4 million tons to 501.1 million, mainly on a reduction for Bangladesh due to damaging floods, but global production remains a record.  Global 2020/21 consumption is lowered fractionally but remains a record at 499.2 million tons as reductions for Bangladesh and Cambodia are partially offset by China.  World trade is virtually unchanged at 44.3 million tons as lower exports for China and the United States are almost offset by higher exports by Turkey and Cambodia.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are raised 0.6 million tons to a record 179.8 million with China and India accounting for 65 and 17 percent of the total, respectively.",
    "September_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected higher this month as forecast increases in corn and sorghum production more than offset declines in projected beginning stocks for the same crops.  Corn production is forecast 80 million bushels higher at a record 13.8 billion bushels.  The national average corn yield is forecast at 155.3 bushels per acre, up 0.9 bushels from last month.  Higher yields for the Central Plains and across the South more than offset yield reductions for Iowa and North Dakota.  Sorghum production is forecast 37 million bushels higher with the national average yield raised 6.1 bushels per acre mostly with higher yields and production for Kansas and Texas.Corn supplies for 2013/14 are projected 18 million bushels higher due to increased production; however, projected imports are reduced 5 million bushels and beginning stocks are down 58 million bushels on lower imports and higher use projections for 2012/13.  Projected corn use for 2013/14 is unchanged.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 18 million bushels higher.  The projected season-average farm price for corn is lowered 10 cents at both ends of the range to $4.40 to $5.20 per bushel.  Total corn use for 2012/13 is projected 55 million bushels higher.  Corn used in the production of ethanol is raised 15 million bushels based on stronger-than-expected August ethanol production as indicated by weekly ethanol production data from the Energy Information Administration.  Partly offsetting is a 5-million-bushel reduction in corn used for sweeteners.  Corn exports are raised 20 million bushels based on the latest information from the U.S. Bureau of Census and August grain inspections.  Projected feed and residual use is raised 25 million bushels reflecting the limited amount of new-crop corn available for use before September 1 due to delayed 2013 crop maturity.  The 2012/13 season-average farm price for corn is lowered 5 cents per bushel from the midpoint of last month\u2019s projected range with the lower prices reported for July and August.  At $6.90 per bushel, the 2012/13 price remains a record and well above the previous record of $6.22 per bushel in 2011/12.  Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 0.5 million tons lower mostly reflecting lower foreign corn production.  Foreign 2013/14 corn production is lowered 2.5 million tons with reductions for Argentina, Canada, Serbia, and Paraguay.  Reductions for Argentina and Paraguay reflect smaller expected areas for crops that have yet to be planted.  Foreign corn beginning stocks for 2013/14 are raised 1.0 million tons mostly with an increase in 2012/13 Brazil production.  Barley production for 2013/14 is raised 1.0 million tons for the European Union and 0.5 million tons each for Canada and Ukraine.  Russia barley production is lowered 0.5 million tons.

Nigeria millet production is lowered with the data series revised back to 2011/12.  Global 2013/14 corn consumption is lowered with reductions in corn feeding in Argentina, Canada, and Serbia more than offsetting an increase for South Korea where wheat feeding is reduced this month.  South Korea corn imports are raised accordingly.  Corn exports for 2013/14 are lowered for Argentina, Paraguay, and Serbia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 1.3 million tons higher with larger stocks in Brazil and the United States.RICE:  U.S. 2013/14 rice supplies are increased 5.6 million cwt or 2 percent because of increases in beginning stocks and production.  Imports are unchanged from a month ago.  U.S. rice production in 2013/14 is forecast at 185.1 million cwt, up 3.7 million from last month due both to an increase in area harvested and yield.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.46 million acres, up 15,000 acres from last month. Harvested area estimates are raised for all states except Mississippi and Missouri which are lowered.  The average yield is estimated at a record 7,511 pounds per acre, up 105 pounds per acre from last month, with increases in all states except California and Texas.

Projected global 2013/14 rice ending stocks are nearly unchanged from last month as the changes on the supply and use sides nearly balance.   Global rice production is projected at a record 476.8 million tons, down 1.2 million tons from last month, primarily due to smaller crops forecast for Brazil and China.  China\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 142.0 million, down 1 percent from 2012/13.  Hot dry weather in the lower Yangtze River Valley and in the southwest stressed mostly the single rice crop.  Rice production is likely to be negatively affected in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces.  Brazil\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is lowered 0.2 million tons to 8.3 million due to a 3 percent decrease in area.  Global consumption is lowered 0.9 million tons due to expected declines for India, China, and the Philippines. Global exports are raised slightly from a month ago largely due to an increase in India that is partially offset by a decrease in Brazil. Import projections are raised for Iran and Panama and lowered for the Philippines. Global ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 107.4 million tons, down less than 100,000 tons from last month, but up 2.2 million from the previous year.

RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for increased supplies, higher domestic use, lower exports, and larger ending stocks.  Supplies are raised as NASS increased rice production by 3.3 million cwt to 193.8 million, all on higher yields.  The all rice yield is forecast at a record 7,756 pounds per acre, up 131 pounds from the previous forecast.  Record yields are forecast for Arkansas, California, Mississippi, and Missouri.  This increase in supply is partially offset by a reduction in imports, all long-grain, as monthly Census imports continue to run below last year\u2019s pace.  All rice imports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 35.0 million but remain above last year.  Domestic and residual use is raised 1.5 million cwt to 147.5 million on increased supplies.

The season-average farm price received by producers is unchanged at $6.75 per bushel.Global coarse grain production for 2022/23 is forecast 3.3 million tons higher to 1,479.2 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, lower trade, and higher ending stocks relative to last month.  Corn production is raised for Ukraine, reflecting higher area based on data reported by the government.  Barley production is lowered for the EU, mostly on forecast declines for Spain and France that are partially offset by an increase for Germany.  Barley production for Australia and Ukraine is reduced based on declines in area.  Major global trade changes for 2022/23 include larger corn imports for the EU, but reductions for Morocco, Jordan, and Peru.  Barley exports are lowered for Australia, the EU, and Ukraine.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised relative to last month, mostly on increases for Ukraine and Russia.  Global corn ending stocks, at 310.5 million tons, are up 5.3 million from last month.RICE:  The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for higher beginning and ending stocks with no other changes to the 2022/23 balance sheet.  The 2022/23 all rice beginning stocks are increased 1.0 million cwt to 38.5 million, due to a combination of higher imports and lower exports in 2021/22.  For 2021/22, all-rice imports are raised 1.0 million cwt to a record 35.5 million on increased shipments from Asia in the first four months of 2022 as indicated by Census data.  All rice 2021/22 domestic and residual use is increased by 1.0 million cwt to 148.5 million as the increase in imports is expected to raise consumption by an equivalent amount.  All rice 2021/22 exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 84.0 million (all long-grain) on a recent extremely slow pace of sales as U.S. rice prices are increasingly uncompetitive.  The 2022/23 all rice season average farm price (SAFP) is unchanged at $17.80 per cwt, up $1.90 from the revised 2021/22 SAFP.  The 2022/23 global outlook is for smaller supplies, increased consumption, unchanged trade, and lower stocks.  Supplies are lowered 2.0 million tons to 702.7 million, primarily on lower beginning stocks for India that were only partly offset by larger production in India and Peru.  Rice production in India for 2021/22 is raised 0.7 million tons to 129.7 million on revised estimates from the Government of India.  India\u2019s domestic consumption is raised 3.5 million tons in 2021/22 to 107.0 million on higher-than-expected use in food assistance programs.  World 2022/23 consumption is raised 0.8 million tons to a record 519.2 million, mainly on increased consumption in India.  Projected 2022/23 global ending stocks are lowered 2.8 million tons to 183.4 million, down 4.6 million from the record high in 2020/21 and the second year of declining global stocks after consecutive year-after-year growth from 2006/07 through 2020/21.",
    "July_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies and higher ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are raised 25 million bushels, based on reduced feed and residual use for 2021/22 as indicated in the June 30 Grain Stocks report.  Corn production for 2022/23 is forecast 45 million bushels higher based on greater planted and harvested area from the June 30 Acreage report.  The yield is unchanged at 177.0 bushels per acre.  With no use changes, ending stocks are up 70 million bushels.  The season-average farm price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $6.65 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production and use, and larger stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is down, with reductions for Russia, the EU, and Kenya partially offset by an increase for Paraguay.  Russia corn production is lowered reflecting a cut in area.  EU corn production is reduced with a forecast decline for Italy.  For 2021/22, corn production is raised for Paraguay with increases to both area and yield.  Foreign barley production for 2022/23 is lowered with reductions for Canada and the EU.  Major global trade changes for 2022/23 include larger corn exports for Paraguay with a reduction for Russia.  Corn imports are raised for Zimbabwe.  Barley exports are lowered for Canada and the EU.  Foreign corn ending stocks are up marginally relative to last month.  Global corn stocks, at 313.0 million tons, are up 2.5 million tons relative to last month.     RICE:  The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for slightly larger supplies, higher domestic use, lower exports, and larger ending stocks.  Supplies are raised slightly as increased beginning stocks and imports more than offset lower production.  Beginning stocks are higher on increased imports and lower exports for 2021/22.  All rice production for the 2022 crop is reduced 8.2 million cwt to 174.5 million with most of the reduction in medium- and short-grain.  The NASS Acreage report showed California, the leading medium- and short-grain producing state, with the lowest rice acreage since 1958 on limited water allocations.  All rice imports are raised to a record 43.0 million cwt on reduced domestic supplies of medium- and short-grain and on the trend of higher Asian aromatic long-grain imports expected to continue.  Domestic and residual use is raised to 145.0 million cwt due to record imports.  All rice exports are reduced 3.0 million cwt to 79.0 million on reduced supplies of U.S. grown rice.  Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are raised to 35.5 million cwt but are still down 16 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price (SAFP) for all rice is raised $0.40 per cwt to a record $18.20, all on a higher California medium- and short-grain SAFP. The 2022/23 global outlook is for lower supplies, consumption, and stocks with higher trade.  Supplies are reduced 1.3 million tons to 701.4 million primarily on lower beginning stocks for India and Pakistan and reduced production from the EU and United States.  EU production is forecast at the lowest level since 1995/96 on severe drought conditions in Italy and Spain, the two largest rice producing countries in the EU.  World 2022/23 consumption is reduced by 0.6 million tons to 518.6 million, still a record.  Global 2022/23 trade is raised 0.4 million tons to 54.6 million on higher exports by Pakistan and Cambodia.  Projected 2022/23 world ending stocks are reduced by 0.7 million tons to 182.8 million, primarily on reductions for India and Pakistan.       ",
    "January_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn outlook is for higher production, greater food, seed, and industrial use (FSI), lower exports, and larger ending stocks.  Corn production is estimated at 15.115 billion bushels, up 53 million on a 0.3-million acre increase in harvested area.  Total corn use is virtually unchanged at 14.835 billion.  Exports are lowered 75 million bushels to 2.425 billion, reflecting expectations of increased competition from other exporters.  FSI use is raised 80 million bushels.  Corn used for ethanol is raised 75 million bushels to 5.325 billion, based on data through November from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and weekly ethanol production data as reported by the Energy Information Administration for the month of December.  The projected amount of corn used for glucose and dextrose is raised 5 million bushels.  Feed and residual use is unchanged at 5.650 billion, based on indicated disappearance during the September-November quarter as reflected by the Grain Stocks report.  With use essentially unchanged and supply rising, corn stocks are raised 47 million bushels.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $5.45 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2021/22 is forecast 1.6 million tons lower to 1,500.1 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, consumption, and stocks.  Foreign corn production is forecast lower with declines for Brazil, Argentina, Kenya, Mexico, the EU, and Paraguay that are partially offset by an increase for Ukraine.  For Argentina, dryness during December reduces yield prospects for early-planted corn in key central growing areas, although with an increase in late-planted corn area for much of the crop the critical phase of the growing season lies in the months ahead.  Brazil is lowered reflecting reduced yield expectations for first-crop corn in southern Brazil.  Other major coarse grain production changes include updated barley, sorghum, and millet production for China based on the latest information from the Rural Statistical Yearbook. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2021/22 include greater corn exports for Ukraine, Pakistan, and Tanzania with a reduction for Paraguay.  For 2020/21, Argentina and Brazil\u2019s exports for the marketing year beginning in March 2021 are raised based on observed shipments to date.  For 2021/22, corn imports are raised for Kenya, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, but lowered for Bangladesh.  Barley imports are raised for Iran but lowered for Saudi Arabia.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lower, mostly reflecting reductions for Brazil, Argentina, and Pakistan.  Global corn stocks, at 303.1 million tons, are down 2.5 million.  RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for smaller supplies, lower domestic use, decreased exports, and reduced ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced on a lower production estimate and decreased imports.  All rice 2021/22 production is estimated at 191.8 million cwt, down 2.0 million from the previous estimate.  The all rice average yield is estimated at 7,709 pounds per acre, down 47 pounds from the prior estimate but still a record.  Imports are lowered 2.5 million cwt to 31.0 million with reductions in both long-grain and medium- and short-grain on a continued sluggish pace.  All rice domestic and residual use is lowered 2.0 million cwt to 145.5 million on reduced production and imports.  Exports are lowered by 1.0 million cwt to 88.0 million; the decline is all for medium- and short-grain on the continued weak pace of sales and shipments.  Projected 2021/22 all rice ending stocks are 33.0 million cwt, down 1.5 million from last month and down 24 percent from last year.  The projected 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.30 per cwt to $15.10 with increases for both the long-grain and medium-and short grain prices.The 2021/22 global outlook is for smaller supplies, reduced consumption, fractionally higher trade, and lower stocks.  Rice supplies are reduced 1.4 million tons to 696.4 million, primarily on lower beginning stocks for Sri Lanka and Thailand and decreased production for Mali and Sri Lanka.  Global 2021/22 consumption is lowered 0.6 million tons to 510.3 million but remains a record.  World trade is marginally higher at 49.9 million as higher exports by India, Vietnam, and China more than offset reductions for Brazil and Paraguay.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are lowered 0.7 million tons to 186.1 million, primarily on reductions for Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand.  ",
    "February_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected higher this month with corn imports raised and exports lowered.  Corn imports are projected 10 million bushels higher based on recent imports of corn into southeastern U.S. feed markets.  Corn exports are projected 50 million bushels lower as larger supplies of South American corn further increase competition for U.S. exports. Partly offsetting is a 25-million-bushel increase in projected U.S. corn use for ethanol based on the strong pace of ethanol production during January, as indicated by weekly Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, and higher forecast gasoline consumption.  Corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised 35 million bushels.  The projected range for the corn season-average farm price is narrowed 5 cents on both ends to $3.35 to $3.85 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 1.3 million tons higher.  Higher Brazil and Argentina corn production more than offset lower corn beginning stocks in these same countries and lower production elsewhere.  Brazil and Argentina 2015/16 beginning stocks are lowered with higher 2014/15 exports.  Brazil corn production for 2015/16 is raised 2.5 million tons based on higher first-crop yields and indications that strong domestic corn prices, reflecting the devalued local currency, will increase second-crop plantings.  Argentina corn production is increased 1.4 million tons on higher area.  Argentina corn production is revised higher for 2014/15, also on higher area.  South Africa corn production for 2015/16 is lowered 1.0 million tons, as continued historic drought conditions further reduce crop prospects despite some stabilizing rain during the month of January.  Indonesia corn production is reduced 0.5 million tons.  Other coarse grain production changes are mostly offsetting with sorghum lowered for Mexico, rye raised for EU, and barley increased for Argentina. Global coarse grain consumption for 2015/16 is raised 0.9 million tons with foreign consumption up 0.2 million tons.  The largest change this month is a 2.0-million-ton increase in China corn feed use as relative internal market prices are expected to support greater corn feeding at the expense of wheat.  Corn use is also increased for Mexico, India and Turkey.  Partially offsetting are corn feeding reductions for Brazil and Argentina. Sorghum feed use is lowered for Mexico.  Global coarse grain imports for 2015/16 are raised 4.3 million tons with corn imports higher for South Africa, Iran, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey.  Corn exports are raised for Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa, but lowered for the United States.  Barley exports are raised for Argentina and Kazakhstan, with higher imports for Saudi Arabia.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are slightly higher, as larger barley and rye stocks more than offset a small reduction for corn.RICE: There are no changes to this month\u2019s 2015/16 U.S. rice supply and use projections.  The all rice price is lowered $0.40 per cwt at the high end and $0.20 at the low end to a range of $12.50 to $13.30.  The long-grain price is lowered $0.20 per cwt at the midpoint and the medium/short-grain price is lowered $0.60 per cwt at the midpoint.  The price changes are made based on reported prices to date and expectations regarding prices for the remainder of the market year.  Global rice supplies for 2015/16 are reduced 1.0 million tons on decreased production and lower beginning stocks.  The largest production change is a 0.5-million-ton decline for Thailand on the lack of water available.  Brazil is down 0.1 million tons on updated government statistics, while crop estimates are lowered for Nicaragua and other Central American countries to reflect drought conditions.  Beginning stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons primarily due to Vietnam.  Global 2015/16 exports are lowered 0.5 million tons led by 0.3-million-ton reductions each for Thailand and Vietnam, both on lower exportable supplies.  Global imports are reduced 0.2 million tons with the biggest reduction 150,000 tons for Iran.  World rice consumption for 2015/16 is lowered 0.6 million tons, but remains a record at 483.7 million tons.  The largest reduction is for Thailand, which is lowered 0.3 million tons on a smaller crop.  With the reduction in global supplies greater than the reduction in total use, world ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons to 89.3 million, the smallest since 2007/08.  ",
    "May_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  The U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2019/20 is for larger production and domestic use, lower exports, and greater ending stocks.  The corn crop is projected at 15.0 billion bushels, up from last year and the second largest on record behind 2016/17 as an increase in area more than offsets a reduction in yield.  The yield projection of 176.0 bushels per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2018 time period.  With beginning stocks down from a year ago, total corn supplies are forecast record high at 17.2 billion bushels. Total U.S. corn use in 2019/20 is forecast to rise relative to a year ago as greater domestic use offsets a slight decline in exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is projected to rise 50 million bushels to 7.0 billion.  Corn used for ethanol is projected to increase 1 percent from a year ago, based on expectations of modest growth in motor gasoline consumption, a slight decline in ethanol\u2019s inclusion rate into gasoline, and larger exports.  Feed and residual use is projected higher on a larger crop, lower expected prices, and continued growth in grain consuming animal units. U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 25 million bushels in 2019/20, despite larger world corn trade.  Increased exports out of Argentina and Brazil during 2018/19 (local marketing years beginning March 2019 and ending February 2020) are expected to limit U.S. exports during the first half of 2019/20.  Combined corn exports for Ukraine and Russia in 2019/20 are projected to decline, mostly reflecting a return to normal weather for Ukraine following a bumper harvest in 2018/19. With total U.S. corn supply rising more than use, 2019/20 U.S. ending stocks are up 390 million bushels from last year and if realized would be the highest since 1987/88.  Stocks relative to use at 16.9 percent would be the highest since 2005/06.  With larger stocks relative to use, the season-average farm price is projected at $3.30 per bushel, down 20 cents from 2018/19 and the lowest since 2006/07.The global coarse grain outlook for 2019/20 is for record production and use, and lower ending stocks.  World corn production is forecast record high, with the largest increases for the United States, South Africa, Russia, Canada, India, and Brazil.  Partly offsetting are smaller crops projected for China and Ukraine.  Global corn use is expected to grow 1 percent, while global corn imports are projected to increase 2 percent.  Notable forecast increases in corn imports include China, Iran, Kenya, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Vietnam.  Global corn ending stocks are down 11.2 million tons from a year ago, mostly reflecting a forecast decline for China.  Outside of China, stocks are up 6.8 million tons, and if realized would be the highest since 2016/17.  For China, total coarse grain imports are forecast at 15.1 million tons, up 2.7 million from 2018/19.  Corn imports are forecast to increase, based on expectations of sharply reduced sorghum imports and a wider price wedge between China\u2019s domestic and world market prices relative to a year ago, particularly in the feed deficit South.  RICE: The 2019/20 outlook for U.S. rice is for higher supplies, exports, domestic use, and ending stocks.  For the 2018/19 market year, imports and exports are each reduced 1.0 million cwt, and the season-average farm price is lowered $0.10 per cwt to $12.00.  U.S. 2019/20 all rice production is projected at 218.2 million cwt, down 3 percent from the previous year.  Both long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain production are projected to be smaller this year.  The year-over-year supply increase stems from an 82 percent increase in beginning stocks.  Total U.S. rice supplies are projected to increase more than 6 percent to 299.8 million cwt.  U.S. 2019/20 total use is projected at 241.0 million cwt, up nearly 6 percent from the previous year with both domestic and residual use and exports higher.  Long-grain exports are projected up 9 percent to 72.0 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain exports are up 7 percent to 29.0 million cwt.  Both export changes are based on improved price competitiveness and larger exportable supplies.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 58.8 million cwt, up 10 percent and the largest since the 1985/86 market year.  The 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price is projected at $11.20 per cwt, down $0.80 from last year\u2019s revised price.  World rice production for 2019/20 is projected at 498.4 million tons, down fractionally from the previous year\u2019s record.  China and India lead production declines with crops reduced 2.5 million tons and 1.0 million tons, respectively.  Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia have the largest production increases.

This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for slightly higher production, consumption, and stocks relative to last month.  Global corn production is raised 0.4 million tons, as an increase for South Africa is partially offset by reductions for India, Peru, and Russia.  For South Africa, production is higher as continued favorable conditions during the month of February boost yield prospects. Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include higher projected corn exports for Ukraine, South Africa, and the EU.  For 2018/19, Brazil\u2019s exports for the marketing year ending February 2020 are lowered based on smaller-than-expected late-season shipments.  Partly offsetting is an increase for Argentina.  Corn imports for 2019/20 are raised for Canada and Peru but lowered for the Philippines.  China\u2019s sorghum imports are raised reflecting recent purchases from the United States.

Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised 3.4 million tons primarily on a 3.0-million-ton increase for India production stemming from revised government data.  Global exports are lowered 0.5 million tons primarily on a reduced forecast for India, despite its larger supplies.  India\u2019s exports are lowered 0.7 million tons on a slowing pace of trade to African markets.  Global imports are reduced 0.6 million tons led by a 0.3-million-ton reduction for Nigeria which was lowered on a slowing pace of parboiled exports to West Africa and enforcement of land border closures.  India is an important parboiled rice exporter to the region.  World consumption is lowered 0.8 million tons, led by a 0.5-million-ton reduction for India.  With supplies higher and use revised down this month, global ending stocks are raised 4.2 million tons.  Outside of several small and mostly offsetting changes, India accounts for nearly all of the global stock increase.

The corn crop is projected at 14.0 billion bushels, down from last year with a lower forecast area and yield.  The yield projection of 174.0 bushels per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2017 time period.  With beginning stocks down from a year ago, total corn supplies at 16.3 billion bushels, if realized would be down 675 million from the prior year. Total U.S. corn use in 2018/19 is forecast to decline modestly from a year ago on reductions in domestic use and exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is projected to rise 75 million bushels to 7.1 billion, driven by an expected increase in the amount of corn used to produce ethanol for fuel and growth in non-ethanol FSI.  Corn used to produce ethanol is up 50 million bushels mostly reflecting expectations of gasoline consumption growth.  Sorghum FSI is up 55 million bushels on an expected increase in the amount of sorghum used to produce ethanol.  Feed and residual use for corn is projected lower as a smaller crop, increased use of ethanol by-products, and higher expected prices more than offset growth in grain consuming animal units. U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 125 million bushels in 2018/19.  Reduced exports out of Argentina and Brazil during 2017/18 (local marketing years beginning March 2018) are expected to boost U.S. exports during the first half of 2018/19.  However, a nearly 265-million-bushel increase in the combined corn exports for Ukraine and Russia in 2018/19 will likely increase competition for the United States, reducing the forecast U.S. share of global corn trade from a year ago.  With total U.S. corn supply falling faster than use, 2018/19 U.S. ending stocks are down 500 million bushels from last year to 1.7 billion.

Corn production is forecast up from a year ago, with the largest increases for China, Brazil, Argentina, Ukraine, and Russia.  Global corn use is expected to grow 2 percent, while global corn imports are projected to increase 5 percent.  Notable forecast increases in corn imports include Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.  Global corn ending stocks are down 35.8 million tons from a year ago, and if realized would be the lowest since 2012/13.  For China, total corn supply is down 11 million tons in 2018/19, as larger production and imports are more than offset by lower beginning stocks.  Corn area is projected higher based on current cash and futures prices that are above a year ago.  Total coarse grain imports are forecast at 16.1 million tons, down 1.1 million from 2017/18, but still the fourth largest in the world behind Mexico, Japan, and the EU.  World market prices for coarse grains are expected to remain below China\u2019s domestic corn prices, particularly in the feed deficit south, thus driving expected demand for imported feedstuffs in 2018/19.

Total rice supplies are projected to increase 5 percent to 263.5 million cwt, mainly on long-grain.    U.S. 2018/19 total use is projected at 223.0 million cwt, up 3 percent from 2017/18 with both domestic and residual use and exports higher.  Long-grain exports are projected up 4 percent to 72.0 million cwt on improved price competitiveness with increased exportable supplies.  Medium- and short-grain exports are projected 7 percent higher to 29.0 million cwt on expanding exports to the Mediterranean region with reduced Egyptian competition.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 40.5 million cwt, up 18 percent from 2017/18 with most of the increase for long-grain.  The 2018/19 all rice season-average farm price is projected at $11.90 to $12.90 per cwt, down $0.20 from last year\u2019s revised midpoint.  The 2018/19 global rice outlook is for record-high production, consumption, and trade.  World rice production is projected at 489.5 million tons, up slightly from 2017/18 primarily on larger crops for Bangladesh, Thailand, and the United States more than offsetting reductions for China and India.  Global rice consumption is projected at 488.6 million tons, up 2 percent from 2017/18 and led by China.  Global exports are projected at 49.3 million tons, up modestly from 2017/18 but continuing the multi-year trend of expanding exports.  World 2018/19 ending stocks are projected at 144.7 million tons, up marginally from 2017/18.  China is projected to hold the majority of stocks at 67 percent of the total. ",
    "February_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for increased food, seed and industrial (FSI) use and reduced stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 25 million bushels to 5,350 million based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report, and strong pace of weekly ethanol production during January as indicated by Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.  Non-ethanol FSI is raised 10 million bushels.  Corn ending stocks are lowered 35 million bushels from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is narrowed 10 cents on each end to $3.20 to $3.60 per bushel, with the midpoint unchanged at $3.40. Forecast U.S. sorghum exports are lowered 25 million bushels from last month, reflecting the slow pace of export commitments through January, particularly to China. Offsetting is a projected increase in feed and residual use.  Grain sorghum prices are projected to average $2.50 to $2.90 per bushel, down 20 cents at the midpoint to $2.70 reflecting the current weak relationship to corn prices in interior markets. Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast 1.4 million tons higher from last month to 1,329.0 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for increased production, consumption, and trade relative to last month.  Mexico corn production is projected to be record high, as government data indicates higher planted area and a lower level of abandonment following a favorable summer growing season.  Sorghum production is lowered as producers reduced plantings in favor of corn due to the prevalence of the sugarcane aphid.  Ukraine corn production is raised on a forecast record-high yield, based on the latest harvest results to date.  Barley production is lowered for Iran, but raised for Kazakhstan. Major global trade changes for 2016/17 this month include higher projected corn exports for Ukraine and Canada.  Corn imports are raised for Iran and Vietnam, while sorghum imports are lowered for China.  Forecast 2016/17 corn feed and residual use for China is raised, reflecting sharply reduced imports of corn substitutes, relatively low internal market prices and efforts by the government to promote use of domestic supplies.  Projected FSI use for China is increased as lower prices and government support are expected to boost domestic use and exports of corn-based industrial products.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month, with reductions for China and the EU only partially offset by increases for Paraguay and Mexico.  RICE:  U.S. 2016/17 rice exports are lowered 2.0 million cwt to 110.0 million.  Long-grain milled exports account for the entire reduction and reflect the sales and shipment pace to date.  U.S. ending stocks are raised by an equal amount and are the highest since 1985/86.  The 2016/17 all rice season-average farm price range is raised $0.10 per cwt at the midpoint to $10.50.  The long-grain, and the Other States medium- and short-grain season-average prices are both increased.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are raised fractionally this month.  World exports are raised 0.5 million tons led by increases for Thailand and India.  Global use is raised 0.8 million tons resulting in a 0.8 million ton reduction in the world ending stocks forecast.  Global ending stocks are projected to be the largest since 2001/02.  ",

Foreign corn production is forecast higher with increases for Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the EU.  For Brazil, production is raised reflecting increased area; yield expectations are essentially unchanged this month as much of the second crop will enter the critical phase of development during April.  Indonesia corn production is higher as greater area more than offsets a slight reduction to yield.  Corn production is raised for the EU, mostly reflecting increases for Germany, Romania, and the Czech Republic.  Foreign barley production is lower with reductions for the EU and Tunisia.Major global trade changes include lower forecast corn exports for Ukraine, Serbia, and Paraguay, with increases for Brazil, Canada, and India.  Corn imports are lowered for China, Chile, and Bangladesh, but raised for Iran.  Foreign corn ending stocks are higher, mostly reflecting increases for Ukraine, Serbia, the EU, and Indonesia that are partly offset by a reduction for Canada.  Global corn ending stocks, at 305.5 million tons, are up 4.5 million from last month.RICE:  This month\u2019s supply and demand outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice is unchanged from last month but there are offsetting by-class changes for domestic use and residual.  Based on the NASS Rice Stocks report, long-grain domestic use is raised 2.0 million cwt to 115.0 million and medium- and short-grain is reduced 2.0 million cwt to 30.5 million.  The season-average farm price for all rice is lowered $0.20 per cwt to $15.70 on lower-than-expected prices reported by NASS for February for long-grain and expectations regarding prices and marketings for the remainder of 2021/22.The 2021/22 global outlook is for lower supplies, increased trade, fractionally higher use, and reduced ending stocks.  Global production is decreased by 1.0 million tons to 513.0 million, primarily on a lower estimate for Indonesia.  Indonesia\u2019s 2021/22 rice production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 34.4 million, on lower area for its main-season rice crop that was mostly harvested in February and March.  Global trade in 2021/22 is raised 1.1 million tons to 52.5 million, with increased exports for India, Burma, Pakistan, and Thailand.  India\u2019s rice exports for 2021/22 are increased 0.5 million tons to a record 21.0 million on a strong pace of exports to date.  China\u2019s imports are increased 0.6 million tons to 5.2 million in 2021/22 based mostly on a continued strong pace of broken rice imports, which are mostly expected for feed use.  Total global use is raised 0.1 million tons million tons to 511.2 million, as increases for China and the Philippines offset a decrease for Indonesia.  World ending stocks are projected 1.7 million tons lower to 188.8 million, primarily on decreases for Indonesia and India.  Despite the reduction, ending stocks would still be a record high, led by China and India which would hold 60 and 22 percent of global ending stocks respectively.",
    "October_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced supplies, greater feed and residual use, lower exports and corn used for ethanol, and smaller ending stocks.

Corn supplies are forecast at 15.322 billion bushels, a decline of 172 million bushels from last month, as lower production and beginning stocks are partially offset by higher imports.  Exports are lowered 125 million bushels reflecting smaller supplies and slow early-season demand.  Projected feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels based on indicated disappearance during 2021/22.  Corn used for ethanol is lowered 50 million bushels.  With supply falling more than use, corn ending stocks for 2022/23 are cut 47 million bushels.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents to $6.80 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2022/23 is forecast down 3.8 million tons to 1,459.8 million.  The 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, greater trade, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is reduced as declines for the EU and Serbia are partly offset by an increase for India.  EU corn production is lowered reflecting reductions for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and France.  India corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics. Corn exports are raised for Ukraine and India but lowered for the United States and Serbia.  For 2021/22, corn exports for Argentina are lowered for the local marketing year beginning March 2022 based on shipments through the month of September.  For 2022/23, corn imports are lowered for Iran, Japan, and Vietnam, but raised for the EU and United States.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down, mostly reflecting reductions for China and Ukraine.  Global corn stocks, at 301.2 million tons, are down 3.3 million.RICE: The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for slightly increased supplies, unchanged domestic use, lower exports, and larger ending stocks.  Supplies are raised slightly as the NASS October 12 Crop Production report increased the all rice yield 13 pounds to 7,599 pounds per acre.  The 2022/23 export forecast is lowered 2.0 million cwt to 75.0 million, all long-grain rice, as relatively higher U.S. prices contribute to a slow pace of sales this marketing year.  If realized, this would be the lowest all rice export total since 1991/92.  Ending stocks are raised 2.3 million cwt to 33.2 million, which would still be down more than 16 percent from the prior year.  The season-average farm price for all rice is unchanged at $19.40 per cwt. The 2022/23 global rice outlook this month is for lower supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered by 3.6 million tons to 689.3 million for 2022/23, primarily on decreases in production for India and Pakistan.  India\u2019s production is lowered 2.5 million tons to 124.0 million based on the government\u2019s first estimate of the 2022/23 kharif crop.  Production in Pakistan is lowered 1.0 million tons to 7.4 million as widespread and prolonged flooding, particularly in the Sindh province, reduced harvested area and yields.  Global exports are lowered 0.4 million tons to 53.2 million as decreases for India and Pakistan are partly offset by increases for Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil.  Global 2022/23 ending stocks are lowered 2.4 million tons to 171.2 million, primarily due to a decrease for India, and would be the lowest level since 2017/18.  ",

Corn used for ethanol is lowered, based on data through November from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and weekly ethanol production during December as indicated by the Energy Information Administration.  Feed and residual use is reduced 50 million bushels to 5.650 billion, based on indicated disappearance during the September-November quarter.  With supply falling more than use, corn stocks are lowered 150 million bushels to 1.552 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised to $4.20 per bushel.Sorghum production is estimated 2 million bushels higher as increased harvested area more than offsets a reduction in yield.  Food, seed, and industrial use is lowered 10 million bushels on lower sorghum used for ethanol.  Exports are raised 15 million bushels reflecting larger exports to China. Global coarse grain production for 2020/21 is forecast down 9.3 million tons to 1,438.5 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production and consumption, and smaller ending stocks.  Foreign corn production is reduced with declines for Argentina and Brazil more than offsetting increases for China and India.  For Argentina, dryness during December reduces yield prospects for early-planted corn in key central growing areas.  Brazil is lowered reflecting reduced yield expectations for first-crop corn in southern Brazil.Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2020/21 include reduced corn imports for the EU-27+UK, Mexico, Iran, Vietnam, Colombia, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Peru, and Saudi Arabia, with a partly offsetting increase for China.  For 2019/20, Argentina\u2019s exports for the marketing year beginning in March 2020 are lowered based on the shipment pace to date.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lower, mostly reflecting reductions for Brazil and the EU-27+UK.  Global corn stocks, at 283.8 million tons, are down 5.1 million.    RICE: The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for larger supplies, higher domestic use, decreased exports, and lower ending stocks.  Supplies are raised as increased production more than offsets decreased imports.  All rice 2020/21 production is 227.6 cwt, up 1.5 million from the previous estimate.  The all rice average yield is estimated at 7,619 pounds per acre, up 59 pounds from the prior estimate.  Imports are lowered 0.3 million cwt to 36.2 million with all the reduction in medium- and short-grain.  All rice domestic and residual use is raised 14.5 million cwt to 160.0 million on higher-than-expected usage for August-November as implied by the NASS Rice Stocks report.  Exports are lowered by 1.0 million cwt to 94.0 million, all for long-grain on the continued weak pace of sales and shipments for long-grain milled rice.

    "April_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced imports, greater feed and residual use, lower food, seed, and industrial use, and larger stocks.  Feed and residual use is raised 150 million bushels to 5.675 billion.  This is based on corn stocks reported as of March 1 which indicated disappearance during the December-February quarter rose about 4 percent relative to a year ago.  Lower forecast corn used for ethanol also supports larger feed and residual use.  Corn used to produce ethanol is lowered 375 million bushels to 5.050 billion based on the latest indications from Energy Information Administration data indicating an unprecedented decline in ethanol production and motor gasoline consumption as a result of COVID-19.  Partly offsetting is a forecast increase in the amount of corn used for alcohol for beverages and manufacturing use.  With supply down fractionally and use declining, ending stocks are raised 200 million bushels to 2.092 billion.  The season-average marketing weighted corn price received by producers is lowered 20 cents to $3.60 per bushel.

Corn imports are raised for South Korea, Turkey, Algeria, and Indonesia, with lower projections for Vietnam, Taiwan, Cuba, and Mexico.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised, mostly reflecting increases for Thailand, Taiwan, India, and Turkey that more than offset declines for Argentina and Mexico.  Global corn ending stocks, at 303.2 million tons, are up 5.8 million from last month.    RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, unchanged domestic use and exports, and reduced ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered by 0.5 million cwt to 261.5 million on decreased imports.  Long-grain imports are lowered on an expected reduced volume in the near-term due to sharply curtailed restaurant usage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are subsequently reduced by 0.5 million cwt to 29.5 million, which is down 34 percent from last year.  The projected all rice stocks-to-use ratio of 12.7 percent would be the lowest since 2007/08.  Reflecting the tighter supplies, the projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per cwt to $13.20 with increases in both the long-grain and California medium- and short-grain price projections.  The 2019/20 international outlook is revised lower this month for supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are lowered by 2.8 million tons to 671.8 million, mainly on production reductions for several Southeast Asian countries, led by Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines.  World 2019/20 consumption is lowered by 2.1 million tons to 490.2 million on decreases for several Asian and African countries with constrained supplies.  Global 2019/20 trade is reduced 2.2 million tons to 42.2 million, primarily on export restrictions recently imposed by several Southeast Asian rice exporters in the form of bans, licenses, and quotas due to domestic supply concerns.  Collectively, projected exports for Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam are reduced 1.7 million tons or 15 percent this month.  Additionally, India\u2019s exports are lowered 0.3 million tons to 10.2 million as the current country-wide quarantine is expected to affect export activity.  These factors have contributed to raising international rice prices to their highest levels in more than seven years.  Projected world ending stocks are down 0.7 million tons this month but are still at a record high of 181.6 million with China accounting for 65 percent of the total. ",
    "February_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected lower with reductions for corn, sorghum, and barley.  Corn accounts for most of the reduction with projected use in ethanol production raised 75 million bushels on higher forecast 2015 gasoline consumption by the Energy Information Administration.  Corn feed and residual use is projected 25 million bushels lower with the accompanying increase expected in supplies of distillers\u2019 grains.  Corn ending stocks for 2014/15 are reduced 50 million bushels.  The projected range for the corn season-average farm price is narrowed 5 cents on both ends to $3.40 to $3.90 per bushel.This month\u2019s changes to 2014/15 sorghum and barley supply and use are driven by adjustments in the trade outlooks for both commodities.  Sorghum exports for 2014/15 are raised 30 million bushels with further strong export sales and shipments to China.  Projected sorghum feed and residual use is lowered 10 million bushels and food, seed, and industrial use is lowered 15 million bushels.  Sorghum ending stocks are projected 5 million bushels lower.  The sorghum farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on each end to $3.55 to $4.05 per bushel.  Projected barley imports are lowered 10 million bushels based on the lagging pace of trade to date.  Feed and residual use and ending stocks are both lowered 5 million bushels.  The barley farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on each end to $5.05 to $5.45 per bushel based. Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 5.0 million tons higher mostly on higher corn production for Ukraine and Argentina and higher corn beginning stocks for South Africa, Argentina, and Brazil.  Higher 2014/15 beginning stocks for South Africa reflect reduced 2013/14 exports and an upward revision to 2013/14 production.  Argentina and Brazil corn production are both revised higher for 2013/14.  The largest production change for 2014/15 is a 1.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine corn based on the latest government statistics.  Argentina corn production for 2014/15 is raised 1.0 million tons reflecting mostly favorable growing conditions.  Corn production is raised 0.5 million tons for India and 0.2 million tons each for EU, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Turkey.  Russia corn production is reduced 0.5 million tons.  Other coarse grain production changes are mostly offsetting with sorghum raised for Argentina, but lowered for Mexico, and Russia barley and oats production raised and rye production lowered. Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised 4.8 million tons with foreign consumption up 4.3 million tons.  Leading the increases are a 1.0-million-ton increase in EU corn feed use and a 0.8-million-ton increase in China sorghum feed use.  Corn use is also increased for Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Turkey.  Sorghum feed use is lowered for Mexico.  Global coarse grain trade for 2014/15 is raised with corn imports higher for EU, Canada, and China, and sorghum imports higher for China.  Corn exports are raised for Argentina, Ukraine, and South Africa, but lowered for Russia.  In addition to the United States, sorghum exports are also raised for Argentina.

Two additional combined medium- and short-grain farm prices are introduced this month: a California price (on an October-September basis) and a price for Other States (on an August-July basis).  The California combined medium- and short-grain price is forecast with a midpoint of $20.00 per cwt, and the midpoint for the Other States is $15.10.Global 2014/15 rice supply and use projections are lowered from last month.  Global 2013/14 rice production is forecast at 474.6 million tons, down 0.9 million from last month.  The largest declines for Thailand and Cambodia are partially offset by increases for Sri Lanka and Iraq.  Thailand\u2019s 2014/15 rice crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 19.5 million due to a reduction in dry-season plantings resulting from an on-going drought and a reduction in irrigation water availability concentrated in the Central Region.  Thailand\u2019s 2014/15 crop would be the smallest since 2006/07.  Cambodia\u2019s crop is lowered 200,000 tons to 4.7 million due mostly to flooding of the main-season crop.  Global consumption is down slightly from a month ago.  World trade in 2014/15 is lowered 400,000 tons due mostly to reductions for Thailand and Cambodia.  Imports are lowered for Iraq.  World ending stocks are lowered 0.8 million tons to 98.2 million due mostly to a reduction for Thailand, which is partially offset by increases for Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  Thailand\u2019s 2014/15 ending stocks are lowered 1.4 million tons to 9.6 million, the lowest since 2011/12.  Pakistan\u2019s 2014/15 ending stocks are raised 0.5 million tons owing to a reduction in the 2013/14 export projection.",
    "August_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, reduced exports and corn used for ethanol, and greater ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 13.9 billion bushels, up 26 million from the July projection as a decline in harvested acres is virtually offset by an increase in yield.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 169.5 bushels per acre, is 3.5 bushels higher than last month\u2019s projection.  Today\u2019s Crop Production report indicates that Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, and South Dakota are forecast to have yields below a year ago.  Of the major producing states, only Missouri is forecast to have yields above a year ago.  Corn used for ethanol is reduced 25 million bushels to 5.5 billion.  Exports are lowered reflecting U.S. export competitiveness and expectations of increasing competition from Argentina, Brazil, and Ukraine.  With supply rising and use falling, ending stocks are up 171 million bushels to 2.2 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $3.60 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, increased trade, and greater stocks relative to last month.  Ukraine corn production is projected record high, reflecting increases to both area and yield.  Cool temperatures and timely rain during reproduction are expected to boost yield prospects.  EU corn production is raised, as increases for Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria more than offset declines for Poland, France, and Germany.  Barley production is raised for Argentina and Russia, but lowered for Turkey, the EU, and Kazakhstan. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2019/20 include corn export increases for Ukraine and Serbia, with a partially-offsetting reduction for Russia.  For 2018/19, exports for Argentina and Brazil are raised for the local marketing year beginning March 2019, based on larger-than-expected shipments during the month of July.  Corn imports for 2019/20 are raised largely reflecting increases for the EU and Indonesia.  For China, corn feed and residual use is lowered based on lower forecast protein meal consumption.  Foreign corn ending stocks are higher relative to last month, mostly reflecting increases for China, EU, Ukraine, and Turkey partially offset by reductions for Argentina and Indonesia. RICE:  The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use, and lower ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced on a combination of lower beginning stocks and smaller production.  The first survey-based forecast for the 2019/20 crop year lowered all rice U.S. production by 3.3 million cwt to 205.4 million with all of the reduction on a lower yield forecast.  Long-grain production is reduced 3.0 million cwt, while combined medium- and short-grain is lowered 0.3 million.  The all rice yield forecast is lowered 121 pounds per acre from the previous forecast to 7,577 pounds.  Rice yields in all states are unchanged or below last year with the exception of California.  All rice domestic and residual use is reduced 1.0 million cwt to 137.0 million on the lower production while exports are unchanged at 101.0 million.  Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 3.3 million cwt to 47.2 million, down 7 percent from last year\u2019s revised 50.6 million.  The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price is raised by $0.40 per cwt to $12.20 with increases for both long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain prices. Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised by 0.4 million tons to 669.2 million on a combination of higher beginning stocks and increased production.  Global production is higher as increases for Iraq and Vietnam more than offset reductions for Thailand, the United States, and the EU.  Worsening drought conditions in Thailand are expected to reduce rice production by 0.4 million tons to 20.5 million.  World 2019/20 consumption is lowered to 494.5 million tons, mainly on reduced expected use in China for rice feeding and less availability of rice from domestic auctions of stocks.  Global 2019/20 trade is lowered 0.3 million tons to 46.6 million, largely on reduced exports by Thailand as its exports are expected to be less competitive compared to other Asian suppliers.  Projected world ending stocks are up 2.0 million tons to a record 174.7 million with China accounting for virtually all of the increase.  China now comprises 68 percent of 2019/20 global rice stocks.   ",
    "March_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn supply and use outlook is for increased food, seed, and industrial use, larger exports, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Corn used for ethanol is raised 25 million bushels to 5.350 billion, based on data through January from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and weekly ethanol production data as reported by the Energy Information Administration for the month of February.  Exports are raised 75 million bushels to 2.500 billion, reflecting expectations of sharply lower exports from Ukraine.  The projected season-average farm price is raised 20 cents to $5.65 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2021/22 is forecast 1.5 million tons higher to 1,498.9 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, lower trade, and greater ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast modestly higher with increases for India and Russia that are partly offset by declines for Argentina and South Africa.  India corn production is higher with increases to both area and yield.  Argentina corn production is lowered as higher indicated area is more than offset by a reduction in yield.  South Africa corn production is down reflecting lower yield prospects.  Corn exports are raised for the United States and India but reduced for Ukraine.  Imports are lowered for Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Israel, India, and Bangladesh.  Barley exports are raised for Australia and Canada but reduced for Ukraine.  Foreign corn ending stocks are higher, mostly reflecting increases for Ukraine, India, and Russia that are partly offset by reductions for Argentina, South Africa, and Bangladesh.  Global corn ending stocks, at 301.0 million tons, are down 1.3 million from last month.    RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for stable supplies, unchanged domestic use, reduced exports, and higher ending stocks.  Exports are lowered by 1.0 million cwt to 86.0 million with the decline for medium- and short-grain on the continued weak pace of sales and shipments, particularly to the Middle East.  Projected 2021/22 all rice ending stocks are 34.5 million cwt, up 1.0 million from last month but down 21 percent from last year.  The projected 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is $0.20 per cwt higher at $15.90 per cwt.  The long-grain SAFP is raised $0.50 per cwt to $14.00 on expectations of elevated cash and futures prices for the remainder of the marketing year with higher projected U.S. wheat, corn, and soybean prices.  However, the medium- and short-grain SAFP is reduced $0.50 per cwt to $21.60 on lower-than-expected NASS prices reported to date for California rice.  The 2021/22 global outlook is for larger supplies, higher consumption, increased trade, and higher stocks.  Rice supplies are raised 4.9 million tons to 701.6 million, mainly on higher production for India, which is projected at a record 129.0 million tons, up 4.0 million.  This is based on the government\u2019s Second Advanced Estimates of Production and a favorable and extended monsoon season.  India\u2019s 2020/21 production was also increased by 2.1 million tons to 124.4 million on the final government estimate.  Global 2021/22 consumption is increased 0.7 million tons to a record 511.1 million.  World trade is 0.5 million tons higher at 51.3 million on greater exports by India and Thailand.  India\u2019s 2021/22 exports are forecast at 20.5 million tons, surpassing last year\u2019s record 20.2 million.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are raised 4.2 million tons to a record 190.5 million, primarily on increases for India and Thailand.  India accounts for 22 percent of global stocks at 42.0 million tons.",
    "December_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected U.S. feed grain supplies for 2013/14 are raised slightly this month with a 5-million-bushel increase projected for corn imports.  With a record crop now estimated for Canada, additional quantities of Canadian corn are expected to find their way into the U.S. market.  U.S. corn use for 2013/14 is projected higher with increases for food, seed, and industrial use and for exports.  Corn used in ethanol production is projected 50 million bushels higher reflecting the strong pace of weekly ethanol production since mid-October.  Exports are also projected 50 million bushels higher based on the pace of sales to date and higher expected global consumption.  Projected U.S. ending stocks are lowered 95 million bushels.  The 2013/14 season-average farm price for corn is projected 10 cents lower at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $4.05 to $4.75 per bushel based on prices reported to date.  Average prices received by farmers, however, are expected to continue to be reported above prevailing cash bids well into early 2014 as some sales will reflect the higher forward prices available before harvesting.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 3.6 million tons higher.  At 1,420.5 million tons, supplies are up 122.8 million from 2012/13 and 103.1 million above the previous record in 2011/12.  Corn accounts for more than 80 percent of the increase over this period with 2013/14 world corn production up 101.4 million tons from last year.  Global corn output for 2013/14 is raised this month with Canada and Ukraine increased 1.1 million tons and 1.0 million tons, respectively.  Partly offsetting are 0.4-million-ton reductions for both the European Union and Kenya.  World barley and oats production are also raised, up 1.7 million tons and 0.8 million tons, respectively.  Barley production is raised 1.2 million tons for Australia and 0.8 million tons for Canada.  Partly offsetting are small reductions for Iran and the European Union.  Oats production is raised 0.6 million tons for Canada with small increases also for the European Union and Australia.  World sorghum production is lowered 0.4 million tons with smaller crops projected for India and Australia. Global 2013/14 coarse grain consumption is raised 4.3 million tons with half of the increase from higher foreign corn consumption.  Corn feeding is raised for Canada, the European Union, and Ukraine.  Foreign barley and oats consumption are also raised with increased barley feeding in Australia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Canada, and increased oats feeding in Canada.  Higher coarse grain production in Canada, Australia, and Ukraine support increased use for these countries and higher imports allow for the increases for the European Union and Saudi Arabia.   Global corn exports are raised 1.8 million tons with increases for the United States and Canada.  Global barley exports are raised 0.9 million tons with increases for Australia, Ukraine, and Canada.  World corn ending stocks are projected 1.9 million tons lower as the U.S. reduction is only partly offset by a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine.  RICE:  Slight changes are made to the U.S. 2013/14 all rice and rice-by-type supply and use balance sheets. All rice imports are lowered 1.0 million cwt (all in long-grain) to 21.0 million based on U.S. Census Bureau data through October and expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.  U.S. 2013/14 beginning stocks and production are unchanged from a month ago.  U.S. 2013/14 rice total use is unchanged from last month\u2014with domestic and residual use and exports forecast at 116.0 million and 100 million cwt, respectively.  The rice-by-class forecasts of domestic and residual use and exports are also unchanged from a month ago. All rice ending stocks at 30.2 million cwt are down 3 percent from a month ago. The 2013/14 long-grain rice season-average farm price range is projected at $14.80 to $15.80 per cwt, up 30 cents on each end of the range from last month. The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $16.80 to $17.80 per cwt, unchanged from last month.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $15.40 to $16.40 per cwt, up 20 cents per cwt on each end of the range. Global total supplies of rice for 2013/14 are lowered more than the decrease in total use resulting in a drop in world ending stocks.  Global rice production is projected at 470.6 million tons, still a record, but down 2.6 million from last month due primarily to lower forecasts for India and Thailand.  India\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is lowered 2.0 million tons to 103.0 million, still the third largest crop on record, due to the impact of torrential rains from a number of tropical cyclones and flooding in northeastern and southeastern regions.  Thailand\u2019s 2013/14 rice production is lowered 0.6 million tons to 20.5 million, still a record, due to an expected decline in the dry-season or off-season rice crop.  Changes to Thailand\u2019s off-season rice pledging program have cut intervention prices and eligible tonnage for each household by 13 percent making it less appealing to Thailand farmers.  The Philippine rice crop is still a record, but is lowered less than 0.1 million tons to 11.6 million due to the impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan.  Despite being one of the strongest storms ever recorded, crop damage from the typhoon is not expected to affect the nation\u2019s rice supply as the impacted regions were not key producing areas, according to the U.S. Agricultural Counselor in Manila.Global rice consumption for 2013/14 is forecast at a record 472.9 million tons, down 0.2 million from last month due mostly to a decrease in India.  Global 2013/14 exports are increased due to an increase of 0.5 million tons for Thailand, now forecast at 8.5 million.  World imports are also increased with the Philippines and the European Union up from last month, partially offset by lower imports for Iran and the United States.  World ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 104.3 million tons, down 2.2 million from last month, and a decrease of 2.3 million from the year earlier.  Ending stocks are lowered for the European Union, India, Thailand, and the United States.",
    "August_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, greater feed and residual use, increased exports, and larger ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.6 billion bushels, up 356 million from the July projection.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at a record 178.4 bushels per acre, is 4.4 bushels higher than last month\u2019s trend-based projection.  Today\u2019s Crop Production report indicates that Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, North Dakota, and South Dakota are forecast to have yields above a year ago.  The yield for Iowa is unchanged relative to last year, while Missouri, Minnesota, and Kansas are forecast below a year ago.  Feed and residual use is up based mostly on a larger crop and lower expected prices.  Exports are raised reflecting U.S. export competitiveness and expectations of reduced competition from Brazil.  With supply rising faster than use, ending stocks are raised 132 million bushels to 1.7 billion. The season-average corn price received by producers is down 20 cents at the midpoint at a range of $3.10 to $4.10 per bushel.  Sorghum production is forecast 19 million bushels higher with the forecast yield 3.6 bushels per acre above last month\u2019s projection.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use is raised reflecting an increase in the amount of sorghum used to produce ethanol.    This month\u2019s 2018/19 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, reduced trade, and slightly lower stocks relative to last month.  EU corn production is lowered, mostly reflecting reductions for France and Germany that are partially offset by increases for Romania and Bulgaria.  Brazil corn production is lowered based on updated expectations for second-crop corn area that will be planted beginning early 2019.  Ukraine corn production is forecast higher, as timely rainfall and lack of excessive heat during reproduction boost yield prospects.  Other notable corn production changes include projected increases for Zimbabwe, Serbia, and Moldova, with reductions for Zambia and South Africa.  Barley production is lowered for the EU, but raised for Ukraine. Major foreign coarse grain trade changes for 2018/19 include corn export reductions for Brazil, Zambia, and South Africa that are partially offset by increases for Serbia, Ukraine, and Moldova.  Brazil\u2019s corn exports are lowered for 2017/18 based on lower-than-expected shipments observed for the local marketing year beginning in March 2018.  Global corn imports for 2018/19 are raised reflecting expectations of record-high imports for the EU that are partially offset by reductions for Vietnam and Zimbabwe.  Foreign corn ending stocks are slightly higher relative to last month, mostly reflecting increases for Brazil and Zimbabwe that are largely offset by reductions for Zambia, South Africa, Canada, and Russia.  RICE: Total U.S. rice supplies for 2018/19 are raised slightly from last month due to increased beginning stocks that were mostly offset by a smaller crop.  Beginning stocks are raised 2.5 million cwt on a 3.5-million export reduction for the 2017/18 crop year that is partially offset by increased domestic and residual use.  U.S. rice production is lowered 2.1 million cwt to 210.9 million on the first survey-based yield forecast of the 2018/19 season.  Long-grain production is lowered 2.8 million cwt, while combined medium- and short-grain is raised 0.7 million cwt.  The all rice yield forecast is lowered 76 pounds per acre from the previous forecast to 7,523.  Exports for the 2018/19 crop year are lowered 4 million cwt to 98 million on a lack of price competitiveness relative to both Asian and South American exporters.  Ending stocks are raised 1.4 million cwt to 43.6 million and the 2018/19 all rice season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.40 to $12.40. Global supplies for 2018/19 are lowered fractionally on reduced production for Madagascar and Iraq.  World trade is raised slightly, led by higher Pakistan exports and Iraq imports.  Global exports remain record large.  Global consumption and ending stocks are each lowered fractionally.  ",
    "February_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2013/14 are expected lower with a 150-million-bushel increase projected for corn exports.  Global trade data and strong export sales support this month\u2019s outlook for increased world corn imports.  Reduced foreign export prospects also lower competition for U.S. corn in the world market.  U.S. corn ending stocks are projected 150 million bushels lower with the export increase.  The season-average farm price for corn is raised 10 cents on both ends of the projected range to $4.20 to $4.80 per bushel.  Season-average farm prices for the other feed grains are also projected slightly higher.  Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 2.1 million tons higher with higher foreign beginning stocks and production.  Corn beginning stocks are raised for Argentina and South Africa with exports lowered for 2012/13.  Coarse grain production for 2013/14 is up 0.8 million tons as small increases in sorghum, barley, oats, and millet production more than offset a reduction for corn.  Corn production is lowered 1.0 million tons for Argentina as additional dryness in January reduces expected plantings and trims yield prospects.  Production is lowered 0.3 million tons for Russia corn based on final official estimates.  Partly offsetting these reductions is a 0.9-million-ton increase for Ukraine corn output, which is also based on the latest official data.  Area harvested and production for both Russia and Ukraine are records for 2013/14.  Global 2013/14 coarse grain consumption is raised 5.0 million tons with higher corn feeding for the European Union, Canada, South Korea, and Egypt and higher barley feeding for Canada, Kazakhstan, Libya, Kuwait, and Syria.  Corn feeding is also increased for Mexico, but offsets a reduction in sorghum feeding.  Sorghum feeding is raised for China with higher imports.  Global corn imports for 2013/14 are raised 3.2 million tons with increases for the European Union, Egypt, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam.  Corn exports are raised 0.5 million tons each for Russia and Ukraine, but lowered 1.0 million tons for Argentina and 0.5 million tons each for the European Union and India.  With stronger foreign corn use, increased U.S. exports fill the gap between higher foreign corn imports and lower foreign corn exports.  Global barley imports are also raised, up 0.5 million tons, with increases for Libya, Kuwait, and Syria. Barley exports are raised with Australia, but a reduction for Kazakhstan is partly offsetting.  Global corn ending stocks are projected 2.9 million tons lower.  At the projected 157.3 million tons, world ending stocks remain at a 13-year high. RICE:  Slight revisions are made to the U.S. all rice and rice-by-class 2013/14 supply and use balance sheets.  All rice domestic and residual use is unchanged at 120.0 million cwt; however, long-grain domestic use is raised 1.0 million to 89.0 million and combined medium- and short-grain domestic use is lowered 1.0 million to 31.0 million.  The all rice export forecast is raised 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million with combined medium- and short-grain exports raised 1.0 million to 33.0 million and long-grain rice exports unchanged at 67.0 million.  Rough rice exports are increased 1.0 million cwt to 36.0 million, and brown and milled rice exports are unchanged at 64.0 million (rough-equivalent basis).  The increase in the export forecast is due to higher-than-expected exports of medium-grain rice to Turkey as reported in the U.S. Export Sales report.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 27.3 million with long-grain stocks down 1.0 million to 16.3 million, and combined medium- and short-grain stocks unchanged at 8.7 million.The 2013/14 average milling yield is increased 0.75 percentage points to 71.0 percent based on milling yield data from warehouse stored loan data for long-, medium-, and short-grain rice provided by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).  This is the highest milling yield achieved since 2009/10 and is a full percentage point higher than last year as U.S. crop conditions were mostly favorable throughout the 2013 growing season.The 2013/14 long-grain season-average price range is narrowed to $15.10 to $15.70 per cwt, up 30 cents on the low end of the range and lowered 10 cents on the high end\u2014the midpoint of the range is raised 10 cents from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain season-average price range is narrowed to $17.20 to $17.80 per cwt, up 90 cents on the low end of the range and an increase of 50 cents on the high end\u2014midpoint of the range is raised 70 cents from last month.  The all rice season-average price range is narrowed to $15.70 to $16.30 per cwt, up 40 cents on the low end of the range and unchanged on the high end\u2014the midpoint of the range is raised 20 cents from last month.  The reduced prospects for 2014/15 medium-grain production in the Sacramento Valley of California due to drought and reduced irrigation supplies have significantly raised medium-grain prices in California beginning in January.  Additionally, export demand for medium-grain rice is up nearly 12 percent from last year as U.S. medium-grain export commitments from Turkey are more than twice the level of 2012/13 according to the U.S. Export Sales report showing commitments through the end of January.Global 2013/14 rice supply and use projections are little changed from last month.  Global 2013/14 rice production is forecast at a record 471.5 million tons up 0.4 million from last month\u2014the largest increases for Bangladesh and the United States.  U.S. milled production is changed due entirely to the change in the milling yield to 71.0 percent from 70.25 percent.  The Bangladesh crop is raised because of better expected yields due to favorable weather.  Global consumption and trade are up slightly from last month.  World ending stocks are lowered marginally from a month ago to 105.0 million tons.",
    "April_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is for greater feed and residual use, increased corn used for ethanol production, larger exports, and lower ending stocks.  Feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels to 5.7 billion based on corn stocks reported as of March 1, which indicated disappearance during the December-February quarter rose about 6 percent relative to a year ago.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 25 million bushels based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report, and the pace of weekly ethanol production during March as indicated by Energy Information Administration data.  Exports are increased 75 million bushels, based on export inspection data for the month of March that was the largest monthly total on record, surpassing the previous high set in November of 1989.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $4.30 per bushel, as reported prices through February indicate much of the crop was marketed at lower prices.Global coarse grain production for 2020/21 is forecast 1.2 million tons higher to 1,446.0 million.  This month\u2019s 2020/21 foreign coarse grain outlook is for higher production, reduced trade, and larger stocks relative to last month.  Corn production is raised for Pakistan, the EU-27+UK, and Ecuador, with partly offsetting reductions for Argentina and Indonesia.  Barley production is higher for Argentina and the EU-27+UK, but lowered for Mexico. Major global trade changes include lower forecast corn exports for Ukraine, based on shipment data to date.  Corn imports are raised for Bangladesh.  Barley exports are raised for Canada, Argentina, and the EU-27+UK, with partly offsetting reductions for Iraq and Kazakhstan.  Barley imports are sharply higher for China, with a partly offsetting reduction for Morocco.  Foreign corn ending stocks are essentially unchanged from last month, mostly reflecting increases for South Korea and Pakistan that are offset by a reduction for Saudi Arabia. RICE:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for slightly lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered, entirely on reduced imports with all the decrease for long-grain on a lower than expected pace.  Domestic and residual use is lowered (all for long-grain) by 2.0 million cwt to 158.0 million on the NASS Rice Stocks report, issued March 31 and usage expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.  Exports are reduced by 2.0 million cwt to 91.0 million, all for long-grain on a lower than expected pace of sales and shipments.  Projected 2020/21 all rice ending stocks are raised by 3.5 million cwt to 42.9 million, up 49 percent from last year.  The projected 2020/21 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per cwt to $13.70 with increases in both long-grain and medium- and short-grain on NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.   The 2020/21 global outlook is for slightly lower supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks.  Rice supplies are reduced 0.5 million tons to 682.0 million, primarily on lower rice production for Burma, Taiwan, and Indonesia not being completely offset by increased production for the Philippines and Thailand.  World 2020/21 consumption is lowered 0.4 million tons to a still record 504.3 million, mainly on reductions for the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Burma.

Beginning stocks are raised 107 million bushels reflecting upward revisions to both on-farm and off-farm stocks as of September 1 as reported in Grain Stocks.  Corn production is estimated at 13.692 billion bushels, up 31 million as a higher yield more than offsets a reduction in harvested area.  Total corn use is up 155 million bushels to 14.070 billion.  Exports are reduced 75 million bushels to 1.775 billion, reflecting the slow pace of shipments through December, and the lowest level of outstanding sales as of early January since the 2012/13 marketing year.  FSI use is lowered 20 million bushels, with lower projected corn used for starch, glucose and dextrose, and high fructose corn syrup.  Feed and residual use is raised 250 million bushels to 5.525 billion, based on indicated disappearance during the September-November quarter and the 2018/19 marketing year as reflected by the Grain Stocks report.  With use rising more than supply, 2019/20 corn stocks are reduced 18 million bushels.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $3.85 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2019/20 is forecast marginally higher to 1,401.8 million tons.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for slightly lower production and consumption, and reduced stocks.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher with increases for Bangladesh, Russia, and the EU.  Other major coarse grain production changes include larger barley production for the EU, with reductions for China and Australia. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2019/20 include increased corn exports for Ukraine and the EU.  For 2018/19, Brazil\u2019s exports for the marketing year beginning in March 2019 are raised based on observed shipments to date.  Barley exports for 2019/20 are raised for the EU, Argentina, and Ukraine, with a partly offsetting reduction for Australia.  Barley imports are raised for Turkey and China.  China\u2019s corn feed and residual use is raised for both 2018/19 and 2019/20 based on lower barley feeding.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lower, mostly reflecting reductions for China and Brazil.  Global corn stocks, at 297.8 million tons, are down 2.8 million.RICE: This month\u2019s outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice is for lower supplies, increased use, and declining ending stocks.  U.S. 2019/20 all rice production is 184.7 million cwt, down 3.3 million from the previous estimate.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 1.8 million cwt and long-grain is reduced 1.5 million.  The all rice average yield is estimated at 7,471 pounds per acre, down 116 pounds from the prior estimate.  Rice imports are raised 0.5 million cwt to a record 30.1 million on strong imports of aromatics from Asia.  All rice domestic and residual use is raised 2.0 million cwt on higher-than-expected usage for August-November as implied by the NASS Rice Stocks report.  Projected all rice exports are increased 0.5 million cwt to 98.0 million reflecting a 1.0-million-cwt increase for long-grain and a 0.5-million-cwt decrease for medium- and short-grain.  The long grain increase is due to a fast export pace to date, while combined medium- and short-grain shipments have been slow.  With use rising and supplies falling, projected 2019/20 ending stocks are lowered 5.3 million cwt to 28.6 million.  The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per cwt to $13.20.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are down fractionally to 671.1 million tons based on a 1.7-million-ton production decline being mostly offset by an increase in world beginning stocks.  The increase in stocks is almost entirely due to final government data from India.  The production decline is mostly caused by a 2.0-million-ton cut to Thailand\u2019s crop as the severe drought in the region has reduced both planted area and yield prospects.  Partly offsetting is a 0.4-million-ton increase in the Bangladesh crop.  World consumption increased slightly and global trade is down fractionally.  For trade, Thailand\u2019s exports are lowered 0.9 million tons on the smaller crop.  However, this reduction is partially offset by a 0.4-million-ton increase for Pakistan, and a 0.3-million-ton increase for India.  Global ending stocks are lowered 0.8 million tons to 177.1 million but remain record high.  ",

Corn production for 2021/22 is forecast at 14.8 billion bushels, down 415 million from the July projection.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 174.6 bushels per acre, is 4.9 bushels below last month\u2019s trend-based projection.  Among the major producing states, today\u2019s Crop Production report indicates that record-high yields are expected in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.  In contrast, yields in Minnesota and South Dakota are forecast below a year ago.  Total U.S. corn use for 2021/22 is down 190 million bushels to 14.7 billion.  Feed and residual use is down 100 million bushels based mostly on a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  Corn used for glucose and dextrose and starch is projected higher based on observed use during 2020/21. Exports for 2021/22 are lowered 100 million bushels to 2.4 billion.  With supply falling more than use, ending stocks are down 190 million bushels to 1.2 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 15 cents to $5.75 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2021/22 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, slightly lower trade, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher relative to last month.  Ukraine corn production is raised as a reduction in area is more than offset by a boost in yield prospects.  Russia corn production is increased based on expectations of greater area.  EU corn production is lowered, mostly reflecting reductions for Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria that are partially offset by increases for France, Croatia, and Germany.  Other notable corn production changes include projected increases for India, Canada, and Moldova, with a reduction for Serbia.  Foreign barley production is lower, with reductions for Canada, Kazakhstan, Turkey, the EU, and Russia more than offsetting increases for Ukraine, Australia, and Morocco. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2021/22 include forecast corn export increases for Ukraine, Russia, and India with reductions for Serbia and the EU.  Corn imports are raised for Bangladesh, Thailand, and the United Kingdom but are reduced for Iran, Vietnam, Mexico, Egypt, Japan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria.  China barley imports are reduced reflecting sharply lower exports for Canada.  For 2020/21, for the local marketing year beginning March 2021 corn exports are lowered for Brazil but raised for Argentina.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2021/22 are down 1.7 million tons to 253.1 million. RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for reduced supplies, lower domestic use, higher exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced on the combination of lower beginning stocks, smaller production, and decreased imports.  Beginning stocks are lower based on higher exports and fewer imports in 2020/21.  The first survey-based 2021/22 production forecast reduced total rice production by 2.0 million cwt to 197.4 million, all on lower yields.  The all rice yield is 7,544 pounds per acre and is down 76 pounds from the previous forecast.  Total rice imports are lowered 1.0 million cwt, all for long-grain, to 38.0 million on the reduced availability of shipping containers and higher freight costs, which are expected to persist into 2021/22.  Total domestic and residual use is lowered by 2.0 million cwt to 151.0 million on the smaller crop size and less imports.  Total exports are increased to 91.0 million cwt as higher long-grain exports more than offset lower medium- and short-grain exports.  Long-grain exports are raised by 2.0 million cwt to 65.0 million on sales to Iraq for the first time in two years.  Medium- and short-grain exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 26.0 million on reduced supplies and increased competition.  Projected 2021/22 all rice ending stocks are reduced by 4.0 million cwt to 37.3 million, down 15 percent from last year.  The 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price is increased $0.10 per cwt to $14.50.  The 2021/22 global outlook is for increased supplies, marginally higher consumption, larger trade, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are raised by 3.4 million tons to 684.4 million, primarily on a combination of higher beginning stocks for China, Vietnam, and Taiwan and increased production for Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.  Bangladesh production is raised to a record 36.3 million tons on increased area harvested and a higher yield.  World 2021/22 consumption is raised by 0.3 million tons to a record 514.3 million, primarily on higher Bangladesh consumption.  Global 2021/22 trade is raised 0.6 million tons to 47.7 million, mainly on increased exports by India.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are increased by 3.2 million tons to 170.1 million, mostly on higher stocks for China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.  ",
    "May_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  The 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, domestic use, exports, ending stocks, and higher prices.  The corn crop is projected at 14.5 billion bushels, down 4.3 percent from last year. The corn yield is projected at 177.0 bushels per acre, 4.0 bushels below the weather adjusted trend presented at USDA\u2019s Agricultural Outlook Forum in February. The very slow start to this year\u2019s planting in the major corn producing States and the likelihood that progress by mid-May will remain well behind normal reduce yield prospects.  Despite beginning stocks that are up relative to a year ago, total corn supplies are forecast to decline 2.7 percent to 15.9 billion bushels. Total U.S. corn use in 2022/23 is forecast to fall 2.5 percent on declines in domestic use and exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is virtually unchanged at 6.8 billion bushels.  Corn used for ethanol is unchanged relative to a year ago on expectations of flat U.S. motor gasoline consumption.  Sorghum FSI is unchanged but higher than the minimum seen in recent years as China is expected to continue to source sorghum from other exporters in addition to the United States.  Corn feed and residual use is down 4.9 percent relative to a year ago, reflecting a smaller crop, higher expected season-average farm prices received by producers, and a decline in grain consuming animal units.  U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 4.0 percent in 2022/23 as lower supplies and robust domestic demand limit prospects.  Even with record exports projected for Argentina and Brazil, a 550-million-bushel drop in exports for Ukraine due to the ongoing conflict is the primary catalyst for a decline in world trade.  With expectations of robust global demand in the face of high prices, the U.S. share of global corn trade is up slightly relative to a year ago. With total U.S. corn supply falling more than use, 2022/23 U.S. ending stocks are down 80 million bushels from last year.  Stocks relative to use at 9.3 percent would be below a year ago and lower than the 14.4 percent average seen during 2015/16 to 2019/20.  The season-average corn price received by producers is projected at $6.75 per bushel, up 85 cents from a year ago and if realized the highest since $6.89 reached during 2012/13. The global coarse grain outlook for 2022/23 is for lower production and use, and smaller ending stocks.  World corn production is forecast to decline from last year\u2019s record high, mostly reflecting reductions for Ukraine, the United States, the EU, and China that are partially offset by increases for Brazil, Argentina, Serbia, and South Africa. World corn use is expected to decline 1.2 percent, with foreign consumption down 0.9 percent.  World corn imports are projected to fall 2.3 percent, with the largest year-over-year declines for China, Canada, the EU, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.  Notable increases in corn imports include Vietnam, Iran, and Bangladesh.  Global corn ending stocks are down 1.4 percent to 305.1 million tons, mostly reflecting expected declines for China and the United States that are partially offset by increases for Brazil, Serbia, and Ukraine. For China, total coarse grain imports for 2022/23 are forecast at 37.9 million tons, down 5.0 million from a year ago and below the record 50.5 million reached during 2020/21. China\u2019s internal market prices for energy feedstuffs remain higher than the world market, despite a surge in prices among major exporting countries.  Corn imports are expected to decline 5.0 million tons to 18.0 million with a decline in imports from Ukraine.  Barley imports are projected at 10.0 million tons and sorghum at 9.5 million.RICE:  The 2022/23 outlook for U.S. rice is for reduced supplies, exports, domestic use, and ending stocks.  Total 2022/23 supplies are projected at 258.2 million cwt, down 4 percent from a year earlier on lower production and beginning stocks more than offsetting record imports.  All rice production is projected at 182.7 million cwt, down 5 percent from 2021/22 on reduced harvested area and yield.  The projected all rice yield is 7,596 pounds per acre, down 113 pounds from last year\u2019s record with a reduction in relatively higher-yielding California acreage, as indicated in the NASS Prospective Plantings report.  Projected all rice imports are 38.0 million cwt, up from the revised 34.5 million for 2021/22.  Continued strong demand for Asian aromatic varieties and reduced domestic supplies are factors behind the increase.  Domestic and residual use for 2022/23 is projected lower at 143.0 million cwt on reduced supplies.  Exports are projected at 82.0 million cwt, down from the revised 85.0 million for 2021/22 with U.S. rice increasingly uncompetitive due to higher prices.  All rice 2022/23 ending stocks are projected at 33.2 million cwt, down 11 percent from last year.  The 2022/23 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is projected at a record $17.80 per cwt, up $2.10 from the 2021/22 revised SAFP.  The increase for 2022/23 is primarily the result of a record long-grain SAFP and a record California medium- and short-grain SAFP.   The global rice outlook for 2022/23 is for record production, consumption, and trade but with reduced ending stocks. Production is projected at a record 514.6 million tons, up slightly from the 2021/22 record with greater output expected from China, India, and Bangladesh, the three largest global rice producers.  World rice consumption is projected at a record 518.4 million tons, up nearly 8.0 million from 2021/22 with most of the increase coming from India and China.  Global trade is projected at 54.2 million tons, up 1.5 million from 2021/22 as higher exports are expected from several of the major Asia exporters, with India again projected as the leading global exporter and Thailand remaining a distant second.  Projected 2022/23 world ending stocks are 186.3 million tons, down 3.8 million from the 2021/22 record, mostly on a reduction for China.",
    "April_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced feed and residual use, slightly lower food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use, and increased ending stocks.  FSI is lowered 5 million bushels, as a 10-million-bushel reduction in the amount of corn used for glucose and dextrose is partially offset by a 5-million-bushel increase in corn used for starch.  Projected feed and residual use is lowered 50 million bushels to 5,500 million bushels based on indicated disappearance during the first half of the marketing year in the March 29 Grain Stocks report.  With supply unchanged and total use declining, ending stocks are raised 55 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $3.20 to $3.50 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2017/18 is forecast 7.0 million tons lower than last month to 1,315.0 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, consumption, trade, and stocks relative to last month.  Argentina corn production is down based on reductions to both harvested area and yield.  Yield results have been below expectations, while dry conditions are expected to increase the amount of corn harvested for forage or grazed.  Brazil corn production is reduced reflecting expectations of lower second-crop corn area.  If realized, the combined corn production of Argentina and Brazil for 2017/18 would be 14.5 million tons below the record reached in 2016/17.  Other coarse grain production changes of note for 2017/18 include lower barley production for Belarus and reduced corn production for Paraguay, with corn production increases for Mexico and South Africa.  Major global trade changes for 2017/18 include lower projected corn exports for Brazil and Argentina, with reduced export competition from these countries expected to impact the first half of the 2018/19 marketing year in the United States.  Corn imports are lowered for Iran, Malaysia, Taiwan, Mexico, and Chile, with partially offsetting increases for Bangladesh and Turkey.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered 2.8 million tons from last month, with the largest declines for Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil.  RICE: U.S. 2017/18 rice ending stocks are raised 4.1 million cwt to 33.3 million, mostly on decreased exports.  These ending stock levels still remain below the 5-year average.  The 4.0-million-cwt decrease in exports is divided evenly between long-grain and medium- and short-grain.  Rough and milled rice exports are also lowered by 3.0 and 1.0 million cwt, respectively.  The export reduction reflects a slow pace to date as well as increased competition in core Western Hemisphere export markets.  The all-rice season average farm price is raised $0.10 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $12.40 to $12.80.  This increased price is all due to higher projected medium- and short-grain prices.  Global 2017/18 rice production is raised 1.2 million tons to a new record led by 0.3-million-ton increases each for Brazil, Burma, Pakistan, and the Philippines.  Global rice exports are raised 0.8 million tons with a 0.3-million-ton increase for Thailand and 0.2-million-ton increases each for Burma, India, and Pakistan.  Imports are raised 0.5 million tons for Indonesia and 0.3 million tons for Bangladesh.  Global domestic use is reduced fractionally.  With supplies increasing and total use decreasing, world ending stocks are raised 1.4 million tons to 144.4 million and are the second highest stocks on record.  ",
    "October_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, increased exports, reduced feed and residual use and larger ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.778 billion bushels, down 49 million on a reduced yield forecast.  Harvested area is virtually unchanged from last month.  Corn supplies are forecast record high, as a smaller crop is more than offset by an increase in beginning stocks based on the September 28 Grain Stocks report.  Exports are raised 75 million bushels reflecting U.S. price competitiveness and reduced exports for Russia.  Projected feed and residual use is lowered 25 million bushels based on a lower crop and indicated disappearance during 2017/18.  Corn ending stocks for 2018/19 are raised 39 million bushels.  The projected midpoint for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at a range of $3.00 to $4.00 per bushel.  Grain sorghum production is forecast higher from last month, as a 3.9-bushel per acre increase in yield to 75.0 bushels per acre is partially offset by a reduction in harvested area.  Barley and oat production estimates are updated based on the September 28 Small Grains Summary report.Global coarse grain production for 2018/19 is forecast down 3.8 million tons to 1,343.4 million.  The 2018/19 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production and consumption, and higher stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast modestly higher reflecting projected increases for Egypt, Mali, Kenya, Canada, the EU, and Serbia that are partly offset by reductions for Russia and Malawi.  The projected corn yield for Russia is lowered based on reported harvest results to date. Corn exports are reduced for Russia, with more than offsetting increases for the United States, Serbia, and Canada.  Corn imports are raised for Mexico and Israel, with the former based on lowered expected imports of sorghum.  Foreign corn ending stocks are higher, mostly reflecting increases for Mexico, Egypt, and Iran that are partly offset by reductions for South Africa and Turkey.  Global corn stocks, at 159.4 million tons, are up 2.3 million from last month.RICE: The 2018/19 rice crop is reduced 0.7 million cwt to 218.8 million on lower yields.  The average yield forecast is lowered 24 pounds per acre to 7,539 pounds.  Decreases are in Texas and California.  The long-grain crop is reduced 0.5 million cwt to 159.0 million.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 0.2 million cwt to 59.8 million.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 0.7 million cwt to 44.2 million as no other supply and demand changes are made this month.  The all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at a range of $11.20 to $12.20 per cwt with the midpoint at $11.70.  Foreign rice supplies for 2018/19 are raised 0.9 million tons mainly on increased production.  India\u2019s crop is raised 1.0 million tons and Madagascar is raised 0.4 million, both on updated government data.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Egypt on new government policies that restrict rice production.  Global trade and consumption are only changed fractionally.  With supplies rising more than use, global ending stocks are increased 0.8 million tons to 145.2 million.  ",
    "May_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  The U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2020/21 is for record high production and domestic use, greater exports, and larger ending stocks.  The corn crop is projected at a record 16.0 billion bushels, up from last year on increased area and a return to trend yield.  The yield projection of 178.5 bushels per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2019 time period.  Despite beginning stocks that are down slightly from a year ago, total corn supplies are forecast record high at 18.1 billion bushels. Total U.S. corn use in 2020/21 is forecast to rise relative to a year ago with increases for domestic use and exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is projected to rise 245 million bushels to 6.6 billion.  Corn used for ethanol is projected to increase from the 2019/20 COVID-19 reduced levels, based on expectations of a rebound in U.S. motor gasoline consumption.  Sorghum FSI for 2020/21 is lower as expectations of increased sorghum import demand from China reduce available domestic supplies.  Corn feed and residual use is projected higher mostly reflecting a larger crop and lower expected prices. U.S. 2020/21 corn exports are forecast to rise 375 million bushels to 2,150 million, driven by growth in world corn trade.  U.S. market share is expected to increase from the 2019/20 multi-year low, but remains below the average level seen during 2015/16 to 2019/20 with expected competition from Argentina, Brazil, and Ukraine. With total U.S. corn supply rising more than use, 2020/21 U.S. ending stocks are up 1.2 billion bushels from last year and if realized would be the highest since 1987/88.  Stocks relative to use at 22.4 percent would be the highest since 1992/93.  With larger stocks relative to use, the season-average farm price is projected at $3.20 per bushel, down 40 cents from 2019/20 and the lowest since 2006/07.The global coarse grain outlook for 2020/21 is for record production and use and larger ending stocks.  World corn production is forecast record-high, with the largest increases for the United States, Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico, and Canada.  Global corn use is expected to grow 4 percent, with foreign consumption up 3 percent.  Global corn imports are projected to increase 4 percent.  Notable forecast increases in corn imports include the EU, Egypt, Mexico, Iran, Morocco, and Vietnam.  Global corn ending stocks are up from a year ago, as a decline in foreign stocks is more than offset by an increase for the United States.  Excluding China and the United States, ending stocks are up 4 percent relative to a year ago. For China, total coarse grain imports are forecast at 18.3 million tons, up 1.3 million from 2019/20 but below the 2014/15 record of 25.7 million tons.  Since 2001/02, China\u2019s largest individual coarse grain import total occurred during 2014/15 with 10.2 million tons of sorghum.  Over that same time period realized corn imports reached a high of 5.5 million tons.  Expectations are for robust demand from China in 2020/21, with 7.0 million tons of corn, 6.0 million of barley, and 5.0 million of sorghum imports from all sources. RICE: For the 2019/20 market year, exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 98 million and the all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is lowered $0.20 per cwt to $13.00.  The 2020/21 outlook for U.S. rice is for larger supplies, exports, domestic use, and ending stocks.  U.S. 2020/21 all rice production is projected at 216.2 million cwt, up 17 percent from the previous year.  Partly offsetting the increased 2020/21 crop is a 32 percent decrease in beginning stocks.  The total 2020/21 rice supply is projected at 279.3 million cwt, up 7 percent from last year.  U.S. 2020/21 total use is projected at 237.5 million cwt, up 3 percent from the previous year with both domestic and residual use and exports higher.  All rice ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 41.8 million cwt, up 37 percent from the previous year\u2019s low level.  The 2020/21 SAFP is projected at $12.90 per cwt, down $0.10 from the 2019/20 revised SAFP.

    "February_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected higher this month as lower expected exports outweigh an increase in projected domestic usage.  Corn exports are projected 50 million bushels lower based on the sluggish pace of sales and shipments to date and prospects for more competition from Brazil.  Corn use for ethanol production is unchanged, but corn use for sweeteners and starch is raised 20 million bushels, boosting projected food, seed, and industrial use.  Projected corn ending stocks are raised 30 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average farm price for corn is lowered 20 cents at the midpoint and narrowed to $6.75 to $7.65 per bushel.  Reported monthly prices received by farmers to date continue to reflect forward sales made at prices below prevailing cash market bids.Usage changes for 2012/13 are also made this month for sorghum and barley.  Sorghum feed and residual use is projected 25 million bushels lower, but offset by a 20-million-bushel increase in food, seed, and industrial use and a 5-million-bushel increase in exports.  Projected barley exports are lowered 1 million bushels, based on indications of slower-than-expected shipments.  Barley ending stocks are increased by the same amount.  The projected range for the sorghum farm price is lowered 15 cents at the midpoint and narrowed to $6.70 to $7.60 per bushel.  The barley farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on each end to $6.15 to $6.65 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2012/13 are projected 2.1 million tons higher as a decrease in beginning stocks is more than offset by a 2.9-million-ton increase in production.  Lower 2012/13 beginning stocks mostly reflect an increase in 2011/12 corn exports for Brazil and revisions to the Paraguay corn series that lower 2011/12 corn area and yield.  Global 2012/13 corn production is raised 2.1 million tons with increases for Brazil, Mexico, India, and Ukraine more than offsetting a reduction for Argentina.  Brazil production is raised 1.5 million tons based on higher reported area and yields for the first-season crop and good early prospects for second-season corn.  Mexico production is increased 0.8 million tons with higher reported area for the summer crop.  Production is raised 0.6 million tons for India on higher area as indicated by the latest sowing progress reports.  Ukraine production is increased 0.4 million tons on higher reported yields.  Argentina production is lowered 1.0 million tons as persistent dryness in January and early February lowers yield prospects, particularly for late-planted corn.Global 2012/13 production is also higher this month for sorghum, barley, oats, and rye.  Sorghum production is raised 0.4 million tons for Mexico with higher area and yields for the summer crop, but lowered 0.2 million tons for Australia with reduced prospects for area and yields.  Global barley, oats, and rye production are up a combined 0.6 million tons on larger reported crops for the FSU-12 countries.Global coarse grain trade for 2012/13 is higher mostly reflecting increased imports of barley for Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Tunisia and higher sorghum imports for Mexico and Japan.  World corn imports and exports are raised only slightly, but significant shifts are made among countries.  Corn imports are raised for EU-27 and China, but lowered for Egypt, Syria, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.  Corn exports are raised for Brazil and Ukraine, but lowered for the United States and Argentina.  Global corn consumption for 2012/13 is lowered with a reduction in world feed and residual usage.  Corn feed and residual use is lowered 2.0 million tons for Brazil, 1.0 million tons for Egypt, and 0.4 million tons for Argentina, but raised 2.0 million tons for EU-27 and 0.5 million tons for China.  Global corn ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected 2.1 million tons higher with the largest increases expected for Brazil and the United States.RICE:  Slight revisions are made to the U.S. all rice and rice-by-class supply and use balance sheets.  U.S. 2012/13 total rice supplies are raised slightly because of an increase in imports.  Beginning stocks and production are unchanged from a month ago.  Long-grain imports are raised 0.5 million cwt to a record 18.5 million, and combined medium- and short-grain imports are unchanged at 2.5 million.  No changes are made on the use side\u2014all rice domestic and residual is still forecast at 125.0 million cwt and exports at 106.0 million.  The rice-by-class projections of domestic and residual use and exports are also unchanged from a month ago. All rice 2012/13 ending stocks are raised nearly 2 percent to 30.6 million cwt\u2014all in long-grain rice. The 2012/13 long-grain, season-average price is raised 10 cents per cwt at the midpoint and the range is narrowed to $14.00 to $14.60 per cwt.  The combined medium- and short-grain price is lowered 50 cents per cwt at the midpoint and the range is narrowed to $15.90 to $16.50 per cwt.  The all rice season-average price is unchanged at $14.90 per cwt at the midpoint, but the range is narrowed to $14.60 to $15.20 per cwt.Global 2012/13 projections of rice production and consumption are raised from last month, but trade and ending stocks are lowered.  Global 2012/13 rice production is forecast at a record 465.8 million due to increases for Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Nepal partially offset by reductions for Argentina and Laos.  Global consumption is raised 0.7 million tons to a record 469.3 million as relatively small changes are made to several countries including Bolivia, Iraq, and Nepal.  Global exports for 2012/13 are lowered slightly due mainly to reductions for Argentina and China.  Imports are reduced for Bangladesh, Cuba, Egypt, and Indonesia.  Global 2012/13 ending stocks are reduced 0.5 million tons to about 102.0 million due mostly to decreases for Egypt and Indonesia.",
    "December_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supply and use projections for 2014/15 are mostly unchanged as a small increase in projected corn food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use reduces ending stocks slightly.  Expected corn use for sweeteners is raised 10 million bushels dropping projected corn ending stocks just below 2.0 billion bushels.  Supply and use projections for the other feed grains are unchanged.  The projected range for the season-average corn farm price is unchanged at $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel.  The sorghum farm price range is raised 5 cents on each end to $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel, equal to corn, as strong demand from China supports sorghum prices.   Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 1.1 million tons higher.  Higher corn production for China and EU, higher rye production for Russia, and higher oats production for Canada, more than offset lower expected corn and barley output for Argentina.  Upward production revisions largely reflect the latest official government estimates and harvest results. Corn production for Argentina is lowered 1.0 million tons reflecting lower expected plantings, but the reduction in area is partly offset by higher expected yields with abundant early season soil moisture in key growing areas.Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised 2.5 million tons mostly on higher expected barley and mixed grain feeding for EU and higher sorghum feeding for China.  Corn feeding is also raised for EU driving the increase in projected foreign corn consumption.  EU livestock and poultry feeders are expected to shift rations toward coarse grains as abundant supplies and stronger wheat exports make coarse grain feeding more competitive.  Global coarse grain trade for 2014/15 is mostly unchanged.  China corn imports are lowered, but China sorghum imports are raised.  Mostly offsetting the increase for China sorghum is a reduction for Japan sorghum imports.  Barley imports are raised for Saudi Arabia.  Barley exports are lowered for Argentina, but partly offset by an increase for EU.  World corn exports are lowered slightly with a reduction for Argentina only partly offset by an increase for Vietnam. Global ending stocks are projected 0.7 million tons higher mostly reflecting the larger China corn crop.  Small reductions in U.S. and EU corn stocks partly offset the increase for China.  RICE:  U.S. 2014/15 rice supplies at 273.9 million cwt are unchanged from a month ago.  All rice domestic and residual use for 2014/15 is unchanged at 131.0 million cwt.  U.S. long-grain exports are increased 1.0 million cwt to 69.0 million, bringing all rice exports to 103.0 million.  Combined medium- and short-grain exports are unchanged at 34.0 million cwt.  The increase in exports is due mostly to an expected increase to markets in the Middle East and South America.  The all rice milled export forecast is raised 1.0 million cwt to 68.0 million, and rough rice exports are unchanged at 35.0 million.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 39.9 million with long-grain stocks reduced to 27.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain stocks unchanged at 10.6 million.The 2014/15 long-grain rice season-average farm price range is projected at $12.00 to $13.00 per cwt, down 20 cents per cwt on each end from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $18.50 to $19.50 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each end.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $14.00 to $15.00 per cwt, down 20 cents per cwt on each end.  The drop in the price outlook is due mostly to an unexpected substantial drop in October prices reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in Agricultural Prices published on November 26 and price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.Global 2014/15 rice supply and use are changed little from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at 475.2 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month due primarily to increased forecasts for China and South Korea, partially offset by a reduction for Indonesia.  China\u2019s rice production is forecast at a record 144.5 million tons, up 0.5 million tons from last month, and up more than 1 percent from last year.  The revision is based on production estimates recently released by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.  Indonesia\u2019s 2014/15 rice crop is forecast at 36.5 million tons, down 0.5 million from last month, but up slightly from 2013/14.  The Philippine 2014/15 rice crop is forecast at 12.2 million tons, unchanged from last month, but up nearly 3 percent from last year.  Typhoon Hagupit struck the Philippines on December 6 and tracked through some rice growing areas, but missed the larger producing regions.  Initial reports from the government of the Philippines indicated that the storm had little impact on the overall rice crop.  However, USDA will continue to assess the damage and offer a more complete supply and use analysis in next month\u2019s supply and demand report.  Global rice consumption for 2014/15 is forecast at a record 482.9 million tons, down slightly from last month.  Global trade is raised 0.4 million tons based largely on increased imports by Indonesia; with exports raised for Burma, China, Thailand, and the United States.  World 2014/15 ending stocks are raised 0.6 million tons, largely due to increases for China and Vietnam, partially offset by reductions for Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and the United States.  Stocks are also raised for Sri Lanka and South Korea.",
    "March_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for lower corn used for ethanol, reduced exports, and larger stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is lowered 25 million bushels to 5.550 billion based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report, and the pace of weekly ethanol production during February as indicated by Energy Information Administration data.  Exports are reduced 75 million bushels to 2.375 billion, reflecting diminished U.S. price competitiveness and expectations of increased exports for Brazil and Argentina.  With no other use changes, ending stocks are raised 100 million bushels to 1.835 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 5 cents at the midpoint to $3.55 per bushel. For sorghum, 2018/19 exports are lowered 15 million bushels to 85 million, which if realized would be the lowest since 2012/13.  Food, seed, and industrial use is lowered 5 million bushels reflecting a reduction in the projected amount of sorghum used to produce ethanol.  Offsetting is a 20 million bushel increase in feed and residual use.  The midpoint price forecast is lowered 5 cents to $3.30 per bushel.The global coarse grain production forecast for 2018/19 is down slightly to 1,371.9 million metric tons.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for marginally lower production, virtually unchanged trade, greater use, and reduced stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is unchanged, with increased yield expectations offset by a reduction in area.  Faster-than-normal planting progress improves yield prospects for second-crop corn in the Center-West, while area is down reflecting updated expectations for both first and second-crop corn.  Corn production is raised for India, but lowered for South Africa.  Australia coarse grain production is higher, as a forecast increase in barley more than offsets a reduction for sorghum. Major global trade changes for 2018/19 include higher projected corn exports for Argentina and Ukraine and reduction for the United States.  For 2017/18, Brazil\u2019s exports for the marketing year ending February 2019 are raised based on larger than expected late-season shipments.  Partly offsetting is a reduction for Argentina.  China\u2019s coarse grain imports for 2018/19 are lowered, reflecting lower forecast sorghum and barley imports.  China\u2019s corn feed and residual use is raised with lower sorghum and barley imports.  Corn imports are raised for the EU and Canada.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2018/19 are lowered from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for China, Brazil, and Argentina.    RICE: This month\u2019s outlook for 2018/19 U.S. rice is for higher imports, lower exports, and increased ending stocks.  All the supply and demand changes are for medium- and short-grain rice.  Total rice imports are raised 0.5 million cwt to record 29.0 million on increased China shipments to Puerto Rico.  All U.S. rice exports are down 2 million cwt to 98 million on a slow shipment pace to date of medium- and short-grain rice.  Even with this reduction, 2018/19 rice exports are forecast to increase 11 million cwt from the previous year as U.S. rice is expected to be more competitive.  Rice ending stocks are raised 2.5 million cwt to 49.6 million, the largest in more than 30 years.  The all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.70 to $12.70 per cwt.  The entire change is due to increased long-grain prices.  Global 2018/19 rice supplies are raised 6.3 million tons to 664.2 million, mostly on a large increase for India production.  India\u2019s rice crop is raised 5.0 million tons to a record 116.0 million due to favorable summer rainfall and updated government data.  Bangladesh production is raised 0.5 million tons to 35.0 million also on favorable weather and increased harvested area.  Global exports are reduced 0.4 million tons to 47.4 million but still remain record large.  Global consumption is raised 1.7 million tons to 492.0 million, led by a 1.1 million ton increase for India.  With world supplies rising more than total use, global ending stocks are raised 4.6 million tons to 172.2 million to a new record.  ",
    "March_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for larger exports and increased corn used to produce ethanol.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 50 million bushels to 5.575 billion based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and pace of weekly ethanol production during February, as indicated by Energy Information Administration data.  Exports are raised 175 million bushels to 2.225 billion, reflecting U.S. price competitiveness, record-high outstanding sales, and reduced exports for Argentina.  With no other use changes, ending stocks are lowered 225 million bushels to 2.127 billion, and if realized would be down from the prior marketing year.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is narrowed 10 cents on the low end to $3.15 to $3.55 per bushel, with the midpoint up 5 cents to $3.35 per bushel. For sorghum, 2017/18 exports are lowered 15 million bushels to 245 million based on expectations of reduced shipments to China.  Offsetting is an increase in projected feed and residual use to 80 million bushels.  The midpoint price forecast is unchanged at $3.15 per bushel.The global coarse grain production forecast for 2017/18 is virtually unchanged at 1,321.96 million metric tons.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for nearly unchanged production, increased use, lower trade, and greater stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is down based on expectations of a more modest increase in second-crop corn area.  For Argentina, continued heat and dryness during February and into early March reduces yield prospects for late-planted corn.  Yield results for early-planted corn have also been lower than expected.  South Africa corn production is higher as timely rains during reproduction support an increased yield forecast.  Partially offsetting is lower expected area.  Corn production is raised for India based on the latest information from the government.  EU corn production is higher based on recent data for France and Germany.  Sorghum production for Australia is down as a period of heat and dryness during the growing season has reduced yield prospects.  Area is also reduced.Major global trade changes for 2017/18 this month include higher projected corn exports for the United States more than offsetting a reduction for Argentina.  Sorghum exports are lowered for Australia, reflecting reduced exportable supplies.  Corn and barley imports are raised for China, partially offset by lower imports of sorghum.  Barley imports are lowered for Saudi Arabia, based on tenders to date and expectations of robust demand from China.  Brazil 2016/17 exports for the local marketing year ending February 2018 are lowered based on data to date.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2017/18 are higher from last month, mostly reflecting increases for Brazil, India, and the EU.    RICE:  The 2017/18 U.S. rice supply and use estimates are unchanged relative to last month.  The projected season-average farm price (SAFP) for all rice classes are unchanged at the midpoint.  The SAFP for all rice is $12.50 per cwt at the midpoint of the range of $12.10 to $12.90.  Global 2017/18 rice production is raised to a new record of 486.3 million tons, fractionally surpassing last year\u2019s record.  Almost all of the production increase is for India, where production is raised to 110.0 million tons, based on the India government updated data for 2017/18.  The increase in India\u2019s production more than offsets a reduction in Sri Lanka, where production is now below average for the second consecutive year.  Global 2017/18 trade is raised to a record 47.3 million tons, mainly on higher exports expected from India with greater exportable supplies.  World ending stocks are projected increasing to 143.1 million tons for 2017/18, which would match the second highest on record.  China now holds over 66 percent of total stocks.  ",
    "December_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised slightly this month.  U.S. corn use for ethanol production in 2015/16 is projected 25 million bushels higher based on the stronger-than-expected pace of ethanol production during November as indicated by weekly data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  EIA also raised its forecasts for 2015 and 2016 gasoline consumption in the December Short-term Energy Outlook.  Corn exports for 2015/16 are projected 50 million bushels lower, reflecting the slow pace of sales and shipments to date and higher projected exports for Brazil and Canada.  U.S. corn ending stocks are projected 25 million bushels higher at 1,785 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average corn farm price is unchanged at $3.35 to $3.95 per bushel, in line with prices reported to date and current futures price levels.  The sorghum farm price range is lowered 10 cents on each end to $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel, reflecting the latest reported prices through October and continued weakness in interior cash sorghum bids.   Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected lower this month with global corn production lowered 1.0 million tons.  Corn production is lowered 1.5 million tons for India with reduced area and yield prospects as a result of limited monsoon rainfall.  South Africa corn production is lowered 0.8 million tons as October and November dryness has significantly delayed plantings in the higher-yielding eastern growing areas, thus reducing yield prospects.  Partly offsetting these reductions is a 1.3-million-ton increase for Canada corn based on the latest official production estimates from Statistics Canada.  Other coarse grain production changes for 2015/16 are mostly offsetting with lower Argentina sorghum, Chile oats, and Australia barley output offset by higher Canada barley and India millet production.Global coarse grain consumption for 2015/16 is lowered slightly.  Global corn consumption is lowered 1.0 million tons mostly reflecting lower use in India and Taiwan.  Corn use is increased for EU and Chile.  Global barley consumption is raised with increases for EU and Canada.  Millet consumption is higher for India with a larger crop, but oats consumption declines for Chile with a smaller crop.  World corn trade for 2015/16 is lowered with imports reduced for Canada and Taiwan.  Corn exports are lowered for the United States, India, and South Africa, but raised for Canada.  Brazil corn exports for 2014/15 (March 2015 through February 2016) are raised 1.0 million tons to a record 32.0 million putting additional pressure on 2015/16 U.S. corn exports (September 2015 through August 2016).  Global corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are nearly unchanged with higher projected stocks for the United States and Canada offset by lower projected stocks for Brazil and EU.RICE:  The U.S. 2015/16 rice supply and use is changed very little from a month ago.  The all rice import forecast is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 24.5 million, all in long-grain, as the pace to date is slower than expected.  No changes are made to 2015/16 use.  All rice domestic and residual use and exports are forecast at 127.0 million cwt and 98.0 million, respectively. All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 38.8 million, all in long-grain.  Long-grain ending stocks are forecast at 20.8 million cwt and medium- and short-grain stocks at 16.1 million.The 2015/16 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $11.50 to $12.50 per cwt, unchanged from last month.  The medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.00 to $18.00 per cwt, down 60 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price, at a midpoint of $21.00 per cwt, is down 50 cents per cwt from last month.  The Other States medium-and short-grain rice price, at a midpoint of $12.30 per cwt, is lowered 70 cents per cwt.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $13.10 to $14.10 per cwt, down 20 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  Lower-than-expected prices published by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for October along with price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year support the downward adjustment in rice prices from a month ago.Global 2015/16 rice supplies are lowered more than the decline in use resulting in a reduction in ending stocks.  This is the third consecutive year that global consumption exceeds production leading to a drawdown in world ending stocks.  Global production is lowered 4.2 million tons to 469.3 million tons, down about 8.9 million tons from the preceding year, and the smallest crop since 2011/12.  Production forecasts are lowered for Australia, India, Madagascar, and the Philippines.  The 2015/16 India crop is lowered 3.5 million tons to 100.0 million, the smallest crop since 2010/11.  The reduction is due to a drop in expected Kharif rice production as early harvest reports indicate lower-than-expected yields across the northeastern rice growing region.  Additionally, the slow pace of plantings of the Rabi rice crop due mostly to dryness is expected to lower expected yields and production.  Rice production in Australia is lowered 254,000 tons as area is lowered 36,000 hectares to 30,000 hectares.  This is the smallest area in production since 2008/09.  Rice production in the Philippines is lowered 250,000 tons to 11.3 million due to cyclone damage.  The rice crop in Madagascar is lowered 256,000 tons to 2.4 million because of lower yields.Global rice consumption for 2015/16 is lowered 1.6 million tons to 484.6 million tons, still a record.  Consumption forecasts are lowered in India, Madagascar, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Global exports are unchanged at 41.3 million as India is lowered and mostly offset by increases for Thailand and Vietnam.  Imports are lowered for Nigeria and the United States.  World 2015/16 ending stocks are lowered 2.6 million tons to 88.4 million, largely due to decreases for India, Nigeria, and Thailand.  Stocks are down 15.3 million tons from the preceding year and the smallest since 2007/08.  The 2015/16 stocks-to-use ratio is projected at 18.2 percent, down from 21.5 in 2014/15, and the smallest since 17.9 percent in 2006/07.",
    "August_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for lower supplies, reduced feed and residual use, slightly higher food, seed, and industrial use, smaller exports, and lower ending stocks.  Projected beginning stocks for 2022/23 are 20 million bushels higher based on a lower use forecast for 2021/22, where a reduction in corn used for ethanol is partially offset by greater use for glucose and dextrose.  Corn production for 2022/23 is forecast at 14.4 billion bushels, down 146 million from the July projection.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 175.4 bushels per acre, is 1.6 bushels below last month\u2019s projection.  Among the major producing states, today\u2019s Crop Production report indicates that yields are forecast above a year ago in Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota.  Yields in Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, and Ohio are forecast below a year ago.  Iowa is unchanged.  Total U.S. corn use for 2022/23 is reduced 45 million bushels to 14.5 billion.  Feed and residual use is lowered 25 million bushels based on a smaller crop.  Corn used for glucose and dextrose is projected higher based on observed use during 2021/22.  Exports for 2022/23 are cut 25 million bushels to 2.4 billion.  With supply falling more than use, ending stocks are lowered 82 million bushels to 1.4 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $6.65 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, larger trade, and smaller ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is down, with reductions for the EU and Serbia partially offset by increases for Ukraine, Malawi, Russia, and Turkey.  EU corn production is sharply lower as extreme heat and dryness cut crop prospects for Romania, Hungary, France, Italy, Spain, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Germany.  Serbia is also reduced based on lower yield prospects.  Corn production for Ukraine is higher as moderate to heavy late-July rainfall boost yield expectations.  Foreign barley production for 2022/23 is higher with increases for Ukraine, Australia, Russia, Turkey, and Canada that are partly offset by a reduction for the EU.  Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2022/23 include forecast corn export increases for Ukraine, Serbia, Zambia, and Russia.  Exports are lowered for the EU and the United States.  Corn imports are raised for the EU but reduced for Vietnam.  Sorghum exports are reduced for the United States, while imports are lowered for China.  Barley exports are raised for Australia but lowered for the EU.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2022/23 are down 4.2 million tons to 271.4 million. RICE:  The outlook for U.S. rice in 2022/23 this month is for increased supplies, unchanged domestic and residual use and exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are raised on higher production that more than offsets a decrease in beginning stocks.  The initial survey-based production forecast for the 2022/23 crop year increased production from the previous forecast by 1.5 million cwt to 176.0 million, all on higher yields.  The average all rice yield is forecast at 7,627 pounds per acre, up 66 pounds from the prior forecast.  Long-grain production is forecast at 140.3 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production is forecast at 35.7 million.  Combined medium- and short-grain production is still down 24 percent from a year earlier and is at the lowest level since 1985/86.  All rice exports for 2022/23 are unchanged, with an increase for milled rice exports offset by a decrease in rough rice.  Projected all rice ending stocks are raised to 36.5 million cwt, up 1.0 million from last month but still 12 percent lower than last year.  The 2022/23 all rice season-average farm price is increased $0.60 per cwt to a record $18.80, compared to last year\u2019s $15.80, with increases in both long-grain and medium- and short-grain.The 2022/23 global outlook is for reduced supplies, fractionally higher consumption and trade, and smaller stocks.  Rice supplies are lowered 4.1 million tons to 697.3 million, primarily on smaller beginning stocks for India and reduced production for Bangladesh and India.  India\u2019s production is lowered 2.0 million tons to 128.5 million as dry weather in the northeast reduced planted area.  With these declines, 2022/23 world production is forecast only slightly below the previous year\u2019s record high.  World use is forecast at a record, up slightly this month to 518.7 million tons.  Projected 2022/23 world ending stocks are lowered 4.2 million tons to 178.5 million, mostly due to smaller stocks in India.  ",
    "May_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  The U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2021/22 is for greater production and domestic use, lower exports, and increased ending stocks.  The corn crop is projected at 15.0 billion bushels, up from last year on higher area and a return to trend yield.  The yield projection of 179.5 bushels per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2020 time period.  With beginning stocks that are down sharply from a year ago, total corn supplies are forecast to increase modestly to 16.3 billion bushels. Total U.S. corn use in 2021/22 is forecast to decline relative to a year ago as greater domestic use is more than offset by lower exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is projected to rise 220 million bushels to 6.6 billion.  Corn used for ethanol is projected to increase based on expectations of higher U.S. motor gasoline consumption.  Sorghum FSI is unchanged from a year ago as expectations of robust sorghum exports to China limit available domestic supplies.  Corn feed and residual use is unchanged, as a larger crop is offset by increased corn used for ethanol and higher expected season-average farm prices received by producers.  U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 325 million bushels in 2021/22.  Unfavorable production prospects are forecast to limit exports out of Argentina and Brazil during 2020/21 (local marketing years beginning March 2021 and ending February 2022), supporting U.S. exports during the first half of 2021/22.  However, a 335-million-bushel increase in the combined corn exports for Ukraine and Russia in 2021/22 is expected to increase competition for the United States, reducing the forecast U.S. share of global corn trade from a year ago. With total U.S. corn supply rising and use declining, 2021/22 U.S. ending stocks are up 250 million bushels from last year.  Stocks relative to use at 10.2 percent would be above a year ago but still below the average seen during 2016/17 to 2019/20.  The season-average corn price received by producers in 2021/22 is projected at $5.70 per bushel, up $1.35 from a year ago when much of the crop was marketed at lower prices. The global coarse grain outlook for 2021/22 is for record production and use, and larger ending stocks.  World corn production is forecast record high, with the largest increases for the United States, Brazil, China, Ukraine, and Argentina.  Global corn use is expected to grow 3 percent, with foreign consumption up 3 percent.  Global corn imports are projected to increase 3 percent.  Notable increases in corn imports include the EU, Turkey, Iran, Japan, and Mexico.  Global corn ending stocks are up 3 percent from a year ago, with expected increases for the United States and foreign countries.  Excluding China, corn ending stocks are up 10 percent relative to a year ago. For China, total coarse grain imports are forecast at 46.3 million tons, up 3.1 million from 2020/21 and if realized would be record high.  Expectations are for continued relatively high corn and other energy feedstuff prices in China, despite an increase in corn production.  Among the individual coarse grains, corn imports are forecast at 26.0 million tons, barley at 10.0 million, and sorghum at 10.0 million. RICE:  The initial 2021/22 outlook for U.S. rice is for reduced supplies, exports, domestic use, and ending stocks.  Total 2021/22 supplies are projected at 285.0 million cwt, down 2 percent from last year on lower production more than offsetting higher imports and significantly greater beginning stocks.  All rice production is projected at 203.6 million cwt, down 11 percent from the previous year on reduced harvested area.  The 2021/22 projected all rice yield is 7,651 pounds per acre, up 32 pounds from last year.  Total 2021/22 imports are a record 38.5 million cwt with increases in both long-grain and medium- and short-grain.  Total 2021/22 U.S. use is projected at 244.0 million cwt, down 2 percent from last year with both domestic and residual use and exports lower.  Total domestic and residual use is projected slightly lower at 156.0 million cwt with reduced supplies but still is the second largest on record.  Total exports are projected at 88.0 million cwt on reduced supplies, higher U.S. prices, and increased export competition.  All rice 2021/22 ending stocks are projected at 41.0 million cwt, down 4 percent from last year.  The 2021/22 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is projected at $14.20 per cwt, up $0.30 from the 2020/21 revised SAFP.  World production for 2021/22 is projected at 505.4 million tons, a record, and up slightly from last year\u2019s record.  The largest production increases are expected from China, Thailand, and Bangladesh more than offsetting declines in India and the United States.  Global 2021/22 rice consumption is projected at a record 513.3 million tons, up nearly 8.0 million from the previous year with most of this increase due to China with more rice expected for feed use.  Global exports for 2021/22 are projected at 46.5 million tons, slightly greater than last year as higher exports from Thailand, Paraguay, Burma, Cambodia, and Pakistan more than offset reductions for India, Vietnam, and the United States.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are 168.0 million tons, down 7.9 million from last year with China and India accounting for most of this reduction.    ",
    "October_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, increased exports, reduced stocks, and higher prices.  Corn production is forecast at 15.057 billion bushels, down 36 million from last month as a lower forecast yield more than offsets an increase in harvested area.  Corn supplies for 2016/17 are down slightly to 16.845 billion bushels, as a lower crop more than offsets a small increase in beginning stocks based on the September 30 Grain Stocks report.  Exports are raised 50 million bushels, reflecting current U.S. export commitments that are well above a year ago.  Corn ending stocks are down 63 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents on both ends to $2.95 to $3.55 per bushel. Grain sorghum production is forecast 22 million bushels below last month, as a forecast 1.5-bushel per acre increase in yield to a record 77.2 bushels per acre is more than offset by lower harvested area, with the largest reduction in Texas.  Barley production is raised 10 million bushels and oat production is down 12 million bushels based on the Small Grains report.  Grain sorghum prices in 2016/17 are projected to average $2.80 to $3.40 per bushel, up 5 cents on both ends of the range. Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast down 5.0 million tons to 1,314.8 million.  This month\u2019s 2016/17 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, higher consumption, increased trade, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is raised on higher area, based on the latest Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB) report indicating a forecast level of first crop corn area above prior expectations.  Corn and barley production are lowered for the EU, while domestic feed demand and competitive world corn prices underpin larger projected imports.  Russia barley production is down based on the latest government harvest reports. Corn exports are raised for Brazil and Argentina, with larger projected supplies in the former and an expected increase in the relative competitiveness of both countries for the local marketing year that begins March 2017.  Other large month-to-month increases in corn imports are forecast for Iran, Vietnam, and Mexico.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are lowered 1.0 million tons, with the largest stock declines in Argentina and Ukraine.  Global corn stocks are projected 2.7 million tons lower to 216.8 million, but are still record high.RICE:  The 2016/17 U.S. rice crop is reduced 1.1 million cwt to 236.0 million on lower yields.  The average yield forecast is lowered 37 pounds per acre to 7,532.  A reduction in Arkansas is partially offset by increases in California, Mississippi, and Texas.  The long-grain crop is reduced 0.9 million cwt to 177.0 million but still the largest since the 2010/11 record.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 0.3 million cwt to 59.0 million.  Total rice exports are down 3.0 million cwt to 112.0 million reflecting a slow export pace to date and increased international competition.  Ending stocks are raised 1.9 million cwt to 61.0 million, the largest since 1985/86.  The all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at a range of $10.20 to $11.20 per cwt.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are raised 4.5 million tons on higher beginning stocks and production.  Production is increased 1.5 million tons to 483.3 million and remains record large.  Thailand production for 2016/17 is raised 1.6 million tons on beneficial precipitation and good reservoir recharge for irrigation, which led to increased dry-season rice area.  Egypt and Australia production are raised 0.6 million tons and 0.2 million tons, respectively.  However, these increases are partially offset by a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Brazil and a 0.3-million-ton reduction for Sri Lanka.  Global exports for 2016/17 are raised 0.3 million tons and global consumption for 2016/17 is lowered 0.6 million tons.  With total supplies rising and total use declining, world ending stocks are raised 5.1 million tons to 120.7 million.  ",
    "January_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for lower production, reduced feed and residual use, increased corn used to produce ethanol, and smaller stocks.  Corn production is estimated at 15.148 billion bushels, down 78 million from last month on lower harvested area and a reduction in yield to 174.6 bushels per acre.  Imports are raised based on the pace of corn imports through November.  Feed and residual use is lowered 50 million bushels to 5,600 million based on the smaller crop, increased corn used to produce ethanol, greater sorghum feeding, and indicated disappearance during September-November as reflected by the December 1 stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 25 million bushels to 5,325 million based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report which estimated the amount of corn used to produce ethanol during September-November to be record high.  With supply falling faster than use, corn ending stocks are lowered 48 million bushels from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents on both ends to $3.10 to $3.70 per bushel. Sorghum production for 2016/17 is estimated 18 million bushels higher on increases in both harvested area and yield.  Grain sorghum prices are projected to average $2.65 to $3.15 per bushel, down 15 cents at the midpoint reflecting the weakening relationship to corn prices in interior markets. Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast 1.7 million tons lower to 1,327.7 million.  This month\u2019s 2016/17 foreign coarse grain outlook is for marginally lower production, higher consumption, and increased trade relative to last month.  Serbia corn production is raised reflecting the latest information from the Foreign Agricultural Service office in Belgrade.  Partly offsetting is lower corn production for Bolivia where the impact of a severe drought during the growing season was worse than previously expected.  Russia barley production is lowered based on the latest government statistics.  Argentina barley production is lowered on dryness in southern Buenos Aires province during crop heading and grain fill in November and December. Major global trade changes for 2016/17 this month include lower projected corn exports for India, more than offset by increases for Serbia and the EU.  Imports are raised for Bolivia, but lowered for Indonesia.  Foreign corn ending stocks are virtually unchanged from last month, with reductions for Indonesia, Mexico, and the EU offset by an increase for Canada.  RICE:  The U.S. 2016/17 all rice crop is reduced 10.6 million cwt to 224.1 million on lower area and yield.  The all rice average yield is lowered 256 pounds per acre to 7,237 pounds.  Arkansas, California, and Texas accounted for the bulk of the production decline.  The long-grain crop is reduced 9.6 million cwt to 166.5 million but remains the largest since the 2010/11 record.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 57.7 million.  All rice domestic and residual use is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 132.0 million, based on the smaller crop.  Total exports are unchanged, but rough exports are raised 1.0 million cwt, which is offset by a 1.0-million-cwt reduction in milled exports.  In addition, long-grain exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt, offsetting an increase by the same amount for medium- and short-grain exports.  The projected all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at a range of $9.90 to $10.90 per cwt.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are lowered 1.5 million tons led by a 0.7 million-ton-reduction for Sri Lanka production.  Global exports and domestic consumption are both raised fractionally.  Ending stocks are lowered 1.5 million tons to 118.7 million.  ",
    "April_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected higher with increases for corn, barley, and oats based on indicated disappearance as reported in the March 31 Grain Stocks and adjustments to seed use based on intended acreage from Prospective Plantings.  Corn feed and residual use is projected 50 million bushels lower reflecting indicated disappearance through the first half of the marketing year.  Corn use in ethanol production is projected 25 million bushels higher on a stronger-than-expected pace of weekly ethanol production through March as reported by the Energy Information Administration.  Projected corn ending stocks are raised 25 million bushels.  The projected season-average farm price for corn is lowered 5 cents at the midpoint to $3.55 per bushel, with the range lowered 10 cents on the high end.Offsetting usage changes are made for 2015/16 U.S. sorghum this month.  Projected feed and residual use is lowered 15 million bushels based on the March 1 stocks.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use is projected 25 million bushels higher based on robust use of sorghum to make ethanol during February as indicated in the latest Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report.  Projected exports are lowered 10 million bushels as sales have declined sharply in recent weeks.  The sorghum farm price range is projected 10 cents lower at the midpoint to $3.20 per bushel as discounts to corn remain large in the latest data.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 0.3 million tons higher with a number of mostly offsetting changes.  Corn production is raised 1.0 million tons for Argentina, as timely rain during February and March was beneficial following some dryness and heat during January.  Barley production for Argentina is raised 0.6 million tons on greater area and better-than-expected yields.  Argentina corn production is also revised 1.7 million tons higher for 2014/15.  Mali corn production for 2015/16 is 0.6 million tons higher following favorable summer rain over the main production areas.  Sorghum output is lowered 3.1 million tons for Sudan and 1.2 million tons for Ethiopia, as El Ni\u00f1o conditions over the past year reduced rain in key growing areas. There are also a number of other smaller changes to coarse grains production in several other countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.  Elsewhere, corn production is raised 0.5 million tons for both Mexico and Serbia.  Production is raised for Mexico reflecting the latest government statistics which indicate higher winter planted area in Sinaloa.  The change for Serbia is based on the latest government revisions for the crop that was grown last summer.  Global coarse grain exports for 2015/16 are raised 3.5 million tons as increases for corn and barley more than offset a small reduction for sorghum.  Corn exports are raised 2.0 million tons for Argentina, 0.3 million tons each for the EU and Russia, and 0.2 million tons for Ukraine.  Vietnam corn imports are raised 2.0 million tons, reflecting trade data and updated estimates for feed and residual disappearance.  Corn imports for the EU are lowered 1.0 million tons, on a slowing import license pace and large, competitively priced wheat supplies, which are expected to support greater domestic wheat feeding.  Corn consumption for Japan is revised lower for several years reflecting official government statistics.  Barley exports are raised for the EU and Argentina with higher imports for Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Sorghum imports are lowered for China but raised for Mexico.  China corn feeding is raised, offsetting a decline in wheat as internal market prices are expected to favor corn.  China corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are lowered 2.0 million tons, but the reduction is more than offset by larger stocks in Japan, the United States, Vietnam, Serbia, and Argentina.  Global corn ending stocks are projected 1.9 million tons higher.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 rice supplies are lowered 0.5 million cwt on lower long-grain imports.  Long-grain ending stocks are lowered 0.5 million cwt to 22.5 million.  All rice ending stocks are now 43.4 million cwt.  The all rice and long-grain season-average prices are each lowered $0.30 per cwt at the midpoint to $12.30 to $12.70 and $10.80 to $11.20, respectively.  Medium- and short-grain prices are also down with the California price lowered $0.50 per cwt at the midpoint and the Other States price lowered $0.20 per cwt at the midpoint.  Global rice supplies for 2015/16 are lowered 0.5 million tons, primarily on reduced production.  Brazil and Pakistan production are lowered 0.3 million tons and 0.2 million tons, respectively, both on updated government statistics.  Global trade and domestic use projections are both lowered fractionally.  Global ending stocks are lowered 0.3 million tons to 90.2 million.  ",
    "August_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2013/14 U.S. feed grain supplies are reduced this month with lower forecast production for corn and sorghum.  Corn production for 2013/14 is lowered 187 million bushels to 13.8 billion.  The first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 154.4 bushels per acre, is down 2.1 bushels from last month\u2019s projection.  Sorghum production is forecast 36 million bushels lower with the forecast yield 5.9 bushels per acre below last month\u2019s projection.  Corn beginning stocks for 2013/14 are projected 10 million bushels lower with a 15-million-bushel increase in 2012/13 exports only partly offset by a 5-million-bushel increase in imports.  Feed and residual use for 2013/14 is lowered 50 million bushels this month with the smaller crop.  Exports are projected 25 million bushels lower with reduced domestic supplies and increased foreign competition.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 122 million bushels lower.  The projected season-average farm price for corn is raised 10 cents at both ends of the range to $4.50 to $5.30 per bushel.  Prices received by farmers are expected to remain above cash bid levels through the fall as producers who forward-priced corn earlier in the year support the weighted average farm-gate price.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 2.9 million tons lower as the reduction in the United States more than offsets an increase in foreign supplies.  Global 2013/14 corn production is lowered 2.7 million tons.  In addition to the United States, corn production is lowered for Mexico, the European Union, Russia, and Serbia.  Partly offsetting are increases for Ukraine, India, and Turkey.  Ukraine production is raised 3.0 million tons as higher reported area combines with favorable July temperatures to raise production prospects.  Production is raised 1.0 million tons for India as favorable monsoon rainfall supports increased plantings and a higher yield outlook.  Turkey corn production is raised 0.4 million tons with higher area and higher expected yields.  Global barley production is raised 1.1 million tons with increases for the European Union, Argentina, and Turkey more than offsetting a reduction for Canada.  Global rye and mixed grain production are also raised slightly this month with increases for the European Union.Global 2013/14 corn trade is raised with increased imports projected for Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, and Egypt.  Corn exports are projected higher for Ukraine, but partly offset by declines for Russia, the European Union, and the United States.  Corn trade is also increased for 2012/13 with higher imports for Egypt, South Korea, Turkey, the European Union, and Indonesia.  Exports for 2012/13 are raised for Brazil and Argentina.  Supporting the increase in Brazil export prospects, particularly over the next few months, is a 3.0-million-ton increase in 2012/13 corn production.  Global corn consumption for 2013/14 is projected 2.3 million tons lower.  Reduced U.S. feed and residual use is only partly offset by increases for South Korea, Ukraine, and Egypt.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 0.8 million tons lower with the increases for Ukraine, India, and Brazil, mostly offsetting the reduction projected for the United States.RICE: U.S. total rice supplies for 2013/14 are projected at 238.4 million cwt, up 2.9 million from last month.  Projected beginning stocks and production are each raised from a month ago, while imports are lowered.  USDA's first survey-based forecast of the 2013/14 U.S. rice crop is 181.4 million cwt, up 1.9 million from last month's projection, but down 9 percent from the previous year.  Average all rice yield is forecast at 7,406 pounds per acre, up 76 pounds per acre from last month\u2019s projection, but down only slightly from last year\u2019s record.  Area harvested is unchanged at 2.45 million acres.  Long-grain production is forecast at 124.8 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production at 56.6 million, up 0.8 million and 1.1 million from a month ago, respectively.  The all rice import projection is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 22.5 million due in part to an expected larger crop.  All rice beginning stocks for 2013/14 are raised 2.0 million cwt to 34.6 million because of a decrease in the 2012/13 export estimate to 107.0 million.U.S. total rice use for 2013/14 is projected at 208.0 million cwt, up 1.0 million cwt from last month. The all rice export projection is raised 1.0 million cwt to 96.0 million cwt\u2014all in medium/short grain.  Long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain exports are projected at 66.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively.  All rice domestic and residual use is unchanged at 112.0 million cwt.  U.S. all rice ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 30.4 million cwt, up 1.9 million from last month, but 12 percent below the previous year.The 2013/14 long-grain U.S. season-average farm price is projected at $14.00 to $15.00 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The combined medium- and short-grain price is projected at $15.80 to $16.80 per cwt, unchanged from a month ago.  The all rice price is projected at $14.50 to $15.50 per cwt, down 40 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  A year-to-year smaller crop and tighter supplies, particularly for long-grain rice, are expected to provide some support to prices; however, plentiful supplies among the major Asian exporters will dampen the increase.  Global 2013/14 export prices are expected to be lower than a year ago.The projected decrease in global 2013/14 total supply is greater than the drop in total use thus resulting in a decrease in world ending stocks.  Global production is lowered 0.8 million tons to 477.9 million, still a record, due primarily to a forecast reduction for China, which is partially offset by increases for Pakistan and the United States.  China\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 143.0 million nearly the same as 2012/13.  Hot dry weather in the lower Yangtze River Valley and in the southwest has stressed both the single and late rice crops.  Rice production is likely to be negatively affected in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces.  Global beginning stocks for 2013/14 are lowered 0.6 million tons due mostly to a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Indonesia\u2014Indonesia\u2019s 2012/13 crop is lowered nearly a million tons to 36.6 million.  World 2013/14 consumption is reduced 0.8 million tons with most of the decline in Indonesia and China.  Global trade is raised 0.7 million tons with increases in exports for India, Pakistan, the United States, and Vietnam.  Import projections are raised for China and a number of West African countries, which are partially offset by reductions for Turkey and the United States.  Global ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 107.5 million tons, down 0.5 million from last month, but an increase of 2.7 million from the previous year.  The largest stocks reduction for 2013/14 is for India, down 0.5 million from a month ago.",

    "March_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected lower with reductions for corn and barley.  Corn use in ethanol production is projected 50 million bushels lower based on the new Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report recently released by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).  Reported corn use for ethanol for October through January implies a higher conversion rate than previously assumed.  Partly offsetting the impact of the higher conversion rate is higher-than-expected December ethanol production and a stronger-than-expected pace of weekly production through February as reported by the Energy Information Administration.  The reduction in corn use for ethanol is offset by a 50-million-bushel increase in projected feed and residual use.  Thus, expected total domestic disappearance is unchanged.  Corn exports are projected 50 million bushels higher based on commitments to date and higher projected global demand.  Projected ending stocks are lowered 50 million bushels.  The season-average farm price for corn is projected at $3.50 to $3.90 per bushel, up 5 cents at the midpoint.Revisions to estimated 2014/15 first-quarter (September-November) corn use in ethanol production, based on the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production data for October and November, will be detailed in the March 12 Feed Outlook available from the Economic Research Service at www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn.aspx.U.S. barley ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected 4 million bushels lower with imports lowered 2 million bushels and exports raised 2 million bushels based on the pace of shipments to date.  The projected barley farm price range is narrowed and raised 10 cents at the midpoint to $5.20 to $5.50 per bushel.  The sorghum farm price projection is also narrowed and raised 10 cents at the midpoint to $3.70 to $4.10 per bushel.  Both increases reflect farm prices reported through January.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 2.4 million tons lower mostly on reduced corn beginning stocks and production for South Africa.  Upward revisions to 2005/06 through 2009/10 South Africa corn consumption lower estimated stocks over the last decade and cause a 2.2-million-ton reduction in 2014/15 beginning stocks.  A 1.0-million-ton increase in Brazil beginning stocks is partly offsetting with 2013/14 production raised 0.5 million tons and exports lowered 0.5 million tons.  Argentina corn exports are raised 0.5 million tons for 2013/14.Global corn production for 2014/15 is lowered 1.6 million tons with reductions for South Africa and Belarus only partly offset by an increase for Argentina.  South Africa corn output is lowered 2.0 million tons as February dryness and periodic heat, particularly in the western and central corn growing regions, coincided with corn pollination.  Corn production is lowered 0.1 million tons for Belarus based on indications of lower harvested area from the Ministry of Agriculture.  Argentina corn production is raised 0.5 million tons as a small reduction in harvested area due to recent flooding is more than offset by higher expected yields with abundant soil moisture available for pollination and grain fill in other areas.  Developing dryness in southern growing areas, however, limits this month\u2019s yield increase.Other coarse grain production changes for 2014/15 include a 0.5-million-ton increase for India millet, a 0.4-million-ton increase for Australia barley, and 0.2-million-ton increases for both Belarus barley and rye.Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised 2.7 million tons mostly on higher barley use for China with larger imports and higher millet use for India with larger production.  Barley consumption and imports are also raised for Iran.  Partly offsetting the increases in barley imports for China and Iran is a reduction for Saudi Arabia.  Barley exports are raised for EU and Australia.  Corn imports are raised for Saudi Arabia and Israel.  In addition to the United States, corn exports are raised for Argentina and Brazil, more than offsetting a reduction for South Africa.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2014/15 are lowered 5.0 million tons with corn ending stocks down 4.4 million.  Projected foreign corn ending stocks are lowered 3.1 million tons with reductions for South Africa and Argentina.RICE:  The changes made to the U.S. 2014/15 rice supply and use balances this month are confined to forecast exports, ending stocks, and prices.  The 2014/15 all rice export projection is raised 1.0 million cwt to 104.0 million.  Long-grain exports are forecast at 72.0 million, up 1.0 million from last month based on larger expected exports to markets in the Western Hemisphere.  The combined medium- and short-grain export projection is unchanged at 32.0 million.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 40.9 million cwt, down 1.0 million from a month ago\u2014all in long-grain rice.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 27.1 million cwt, the largest since 2010/11.  Medium- and short-grain ending stocks are unchanged at 11.5 million. The 2014/15 long-grain season-average rice price range is projected at $12.20 to $12.80 per cwt, up 30 cents on each end of the range.  The all combined medium- and short-grain season-average price range is forecast at $18.10 to $18.90 per cwt, up 20 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price is increased 30 cents per cwt to $19.80 to $20.80 per cwt.  The Other States medium- and short-grain rice price is unchanged at $14.80 to $15.40 per cwt.Global 2014/15 rice ending stocks are lowered 0.6 million tons primarily due to increase in consumption.  Total supplies for 2014/15 are lowered 37,000 tons as the increase in production is insufficient to offset the decrease in beginning stocks.  Global production is increased 300,000 tons based primarily on increases for India (+500,000) and Sri Lanka (+150,000), partially offset by a reduction for Thailand (-350,000).  The increase in India is based on an expected larger Rabi crop.  Sri Lanka rice production is raised because of an expected increase in plantings and yield for the Maha crop.  Thailand 2014/15 rice crop is lowered 0.35 million tons to 19.15 million due to a reduction in dry-season plantings resulting from an on-going drought and a reduction in irrigation water availability concentrated in the Central Region.  Thailand 2014/15 crop would be the smallest since 2006/07.  The reduction in 2014/15 global beginning stocks is due primarily to reductions for Burma and Malaysia.  Global rice consumption (includes residual) is raised 0.5 million tons with the largest increases for China and India.  Global rice exports are raised 0.4 million tons due mostly to increases for Burma, India, and the United States.  Global imports are raised for China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.",
    "March_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2013/14 are reduced with higher corn exports and lower oats imports.  Corn exports are projected 25 million bushels higher on stronger world imports and the rising pace of shipments in recent weeks.  Continued strong export sales also support the higher figure.  Projected corn ending stocks are lowered 25 million bushels.  Oats imports are projected 10 million bushels lower as Canadian logistical problems reduce the availability of importable supplies.  Small reductions in U.S. oats domestic use and ending stocks are projected.  The season-average farm price for corn is narrowed 5 cents on both ends of the projected range to $4.25 to $4.75 per bushel.  Price ranges are similarly narrowed for sorghum and oats.  The barley farm price is raised 10 cents on the low end of the range to $5.95 to $6.25 per bushel based on recently higher reported prices for feed barley.  Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 1.4 million tons higher with larger corn beginning stocks for Indonesia, higher corn production for China, and higher barley production for Australia.  Partly offsetting is a reduction in expected sorghum output for Australia as a continuation of hot, dry conditions have sharply eroded prospects for this year\u2019s sorghum crop. Global coarse grain imports for 2013/14 are raised 1.3 million tons with higher corn imports for Indonesia and the European Union and higher barley imports for China.  Higher expected corn and barley feeding in these countries drive the import increases.  Barley feeding is also raised for Australia as drought reduces sorghum supplies and boosts demand for other feed grains.  Sorghum exports are lowered for Australia.  Sorghum imports are reduced for Mexico as strong demand from China has driven U.S. Gulf sorghum prices above those for corn in recent months limiting import opportunities for sorghum feeders in Mexico.  Barley exports are raised for Australia with the larger crop.  European Union corn exports are lowered, but more than offset by this month\u2019s increase for the United States.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2013/14 are raised slightly with higher corn stocks in China and Indonesia more than offsetting lower barley stocks in the European Union and the reductions in corn and oats stocks in the United States.RICE:  The changes made to the U.S. 2013/14 rice supply and use balances this month are confined to the trade categories and ending stocks.  The 2013/14 all rice import forecast is raised 1.0 million cwt to 22.0 million, based largely on the pace of imports reflected in the U.S. Bureau of the Census import data through January\u2014all in medium- and short-grain rice.  A large shipment of broken rice from Australia was reported by the Bureau of the Census for December.  On the use side, the all rice export forecast is unchanged at 100.0 million cwt; however 1.0 million cwt is shifted from rough rice to milled- and brown-rice (on a rough-equivalent basis) export category.  No changes are made to the all rice or rice-by-class domestic and residual use projections.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 28.3 million cwt, up 1.0 million from a month ago\u2014all in medium- and short-grain rice.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 16.3 million cwt, the lowest stocks since 2003/04.  Medium- and short-grain ending stocks are increased 1.0 million cwt to 9.7 million.The 2013/14 long-grain season-average price range is forecast at $15.30 to $15.90 per cwt, up 20 cents on each end of the range with the midpoint forecast at $15.60 per cwt\u2014the highest price on record (since 1982/83).  The medium- and short-grain season-average price range is forecast at $18.70 to $19.30 per cwt, up $1.50 per cwt on each end of the range with the midpoint forecast at $19.00 per cwt\u2014the highest price since 2008/09.  The all rice season-average price range is forecast at $16.30 to $16.90 per cwt, up 60 cents on each end of the range with the mid-point at $16.60 per cwt\u2014the highest price since 2008/09.  The reduced prospects for 2014/15 medium- and short-grain production in the Sacramento Valley of California due to drought and reduced irrigation supplies have significantly raised medium-grain prices in California.  Additionally, old-crop supplies of medium-grain rice in California are drawing down thus tightening the current supply situation.  Finally, Australia\u2019s drought is also increasing medium-grain prices as Australia is a primary U.S. export competitor.  Long-grain rice prices have strengthened as producers in the Delta in 2014 are expected to increase plantings of medium-grain rice and plant less long-grain area, according to trade reports, due to an advantageous price differential between the two rice classes.  There are reports that supplies of southern medium-grain rice seed are fairly tight which could restrict this expansion.Global 2013/14 rice supplies are raised significantly due to several factors including a supply/use series change for Indonesia, and increased production forecasts for Burma, China, and India.  World 2013/14 beginning stocks are forecast at 111.0 million tons, up 4.1 million from last month due mostly to increases for Burma, Indonesia, and India.  The Indonesia rice supply/use series was modified beginning in 2010/11 based on lower population statistics from the government of Indonesia that indicated lower annual consumption and a corresponding increase in stocks.  The Burma rice production estimates beginning in 2010/11 are raised based on a re-evaluation of the series.  Burma\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is increased 1.0 million tons to a record 12.0 million\u2014largely due to an increase in area harvested.  China\u2019s rice 2013/14 production is raised 0.8 million tons to 142.3 million based on official statistics from the government of China.  India\u2019s rice production is raised 2.0 million tons to a near-record 105.0-million tons based on a report from the U.S. agricultural office in New Delhi.  Additionally, India\u2019s 2012/13 crop is raised 0.8 million to 105.2 million tons\u2014based on data from the government of India.  Indonesia\u2019s crop is lowered 0.3 million tons to 37.4 million due to a decrease in area harvested.  Sri Lanka\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is also lowered 0.3 million tons to 2.75 million tons.Global 2013/14 rice consumption is raised 0.7 million tons to a record 474.0 million tons largely due to increases for Burma and India, partially offset by a decrease for Indonesia and Sri Lanka.  World 2013/14 rice trade is raised slightly due mostly to an increase for Burma.  Global 2013/14 ending stocks are projected at 111.7 million tons, up 6.7 million (+6%) from a month ago, and up 0.7 million from revised 2012/13.  The increase in stocks is due mostly to revisions in Burma, China, India, and Indonesia.",
    "December_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn supply and use outlook is unchanged from last month. The projected season-average farm price is unchanged at $3.85 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2019/20 is forecast 6.8 million tons higher to 1,401.7 million. The 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, increased consumption, and higher stocks relative to last month. Foreign corn production is forecast higher with increases for China and Bolivia more than offsetting a reduction for Canada. China\u2019s corn production is raised, reflecting increases to both area and yield, based on the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Canada\u2019s corn production is lowered, as an increase in harvested area is more than offset by a reduction in yield. Corn exports are lowered for Canada, Laos, and Mexico. Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month, largely reflecting increases for China, Bolivia, and Taiwan that more than offset declines for Canada, Colombia, and Paraguay. Global corn stocks, at 300.6 million tons, are up 4.6 million from last month.RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for unchanged supplies, higher exports, and reduced ending stocks.  All rice exports are raised 2.5 million cwt to 97.5 million on export sales and shipment pace to date and on expectations for continued improved competitiveness of U.S. long-grain exports in Western Hemisphere markets.  Long-grain exports are increased 3.0 million cwt to 69.0 million, the highest since 2016/17.  Conversely, combined medium- and short-grain exports are lowered 0.5 million cwt to 28.5 million on reduced exports outside of Northeast Asian markets.  Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 2.5 million cwt to 33.9 million, down 24 percent from last year.  The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at $13.00 per cwt, compared to $12.30 for 2018/19.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised by 0.6 million tons to 671.6 million, mainly on higher production for China as its output is raised by 0.7 million tons to 146.7 million on updated production data from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.  World 2019/20 consumption is lowered by 0.2 million tons to 493.8 million.  Global 2019/20 trade is decreased fractionally to 45.7 million tons, as reduced exports by India and Thailand are not completely offset by higher exports from Vietnam and Burma.  Projected global ending stocks are up 0.8 million tons this month to a record-large 177.8 million with China accounting for 66 percent of the total. ",
    "February_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn supply and use is unchanged relative to last month.  The season-average farm price remains at $5.45 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2021/22 is projected 2.7 million tons lower to 1,497.4 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production and consumption, and smaller ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is lower, mostly reflecting declines for Brazil and Paraguay that are partially offset by an increase for the Philippines.  Brazil corn production is reduced based on lower yield expectations for first crop corn.  Paraguay corn production is down as extreme heat and dryness sharply reduce yield prospects.  Foreign barley production is reduced reflecting declines for Iraq and Syria. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2021/22 include lower corn exports for Paraguay.  For 2020/21, Argentina and Brazil\u2019s exports for the marketing year beginning in March 2021 are raised based on observed shipments to date.  For 2021/22, corn imports are raised for Iran and Canada.  Barley exports are increased for the EU, with higher imports projected for China but lowered for Saudi Arabia.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down, mostly reflecting a forecast reduction for Brazil that is partly offset by an increase for Argentina.  Global corn stocks, at 302.2 million tons, are down 0.9 million.RICE:  This month\u2019s outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice is for smaller supplies, unchanged domestic use, lower exports, and higher ending stocks.  Total imports are lowered 0.5 million cwt to 30.5 million on reduced imports of medium- and short-grain rice.  Medium- and short- grain imports are now forecast at 6.5 million cwt, down primarily because of the timing of Puerto Rico imports this marketing year (MY).  Exports of medium- and short grain- rice are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 23.0 million, as higher U.S.  prices are expected to continue affecting sales for the remainder of the MY.  Long grain exports are unchanged at 64.0 million cwt.  Projected 2021/22 all rice ending stocks are increased 0.5 million cwt to 33.5 million but still down 23 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price for all rice is forecast at $15.70 per cwt, up 60 cents per cwt on higher reported cash prices through December and expectations regarding prices for the remainder of the MY.  Global 2021/22 rice supplies are increased by 0.4 million tons to 696.7 million, as higher production in Pakistan and Bangladesh more than offsets a decrease in Brazil.  Total trade in 2021/22 increases 1.0 million tons to 50.9 million, mostly on higher exports by India.  In the first three months of its MY, India\u2019s rice exports were larger than a year earlier and demand for Indian rice remains strong, including increased shipments of broken rice. India\u2019s exports are raised 0.8 million tons to 20.0 million, slightly below last year\u2019s record.  Exports from Pakistan are forecast 0.2 million tons higher to 4.2 million because of larger production.  World ending stocks are projected up slightly at 186.3 million, and just below last year\u2019s record, with China holding 61 percent of global stocks.",
    "April_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for increased corn used to produce ethanol, reduced feed and residual use and unchanged ending stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 50 million bushels to 5,450 million based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report which estimated the amount of corn used to produce ethanol to be record high during December-February.  The pace of weekly ethanol production during March as indicated by Energy Information Administration data has also been above expectations.  Offsetting is a 50 million bushel reduction in projected feed and residual use to 5,500 million bushels based on disappearance indicated during the first half of the marketing year in the March 31 Grain Stocks.  With offsetting usage changes, ending stocks are unchanged from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $3.25 to $3.55 per bushel.Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast 4.4 million tons higher from last month to 1,346.1 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for increased production, consumption, trade, and stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is raised primarily on larger projected second crop area.  The latest government data indicate a higher-than-expected expansion of area in both the Center-West and North.  Argentina corn production is increased on the latest harvest results indicating better-than-expected yields.  Other major corn production changes include increases for Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan and South Africa, with reductions for Paraguay, Ecuador and Russia.Major global trade changes for 2016/17 this month include higher projected corn exports for Brazil and Argentina, with increased competition from these countries expected to impact the 2017/18 marketing year in the United States.  Corn imports are raised for Mexico, with mostly offsetting reductions for Indonesia, Venezuela, Philippines, and Colombia.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month, with the biggest increases for Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina.  RICE: U.S. rice ending stocks for 2016/17 are lowered 3.0 million cwt on increased exports; at 49.1 million cwt, these would still be the largest all rice ending stocks since 1986/87.  The 3.0-million-cwt export increase is all rough rice, which is record large at 46.0 million cwt, but split with 2.0 million for long-grain and 1.0 million for medium- and short-grain.  Global 2016/17 rice supplies are raised 0.8 million tons on increased production.  The primary increase is 0.6 million tons for Indonesia on favorable weather.  The Pakistan crop is raised 0.2 million tons, while Burma production is lowered 0.1 million tons.  Global consumption is raised 0.4 million tons led by a 0.3-million-ton increase for Indonesia reflecting the larger crop.  Global imports are adjusted lower with cuts to Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.  Exports are lowered slightly with reductions for Egypt and Pakistan offsetting the increase for the United States.  With supplies rising faster than total use, global ending stocks are increased 0.4 million tons to 118.1 million, the largest since 2001/02.  ",
    "January_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2015/16 are lowered as small increases in corn and sorghum imports and sorghum production are more than offset by a reduction in corn production.  Harvested area for corn is raised slightly, but the national average yield is estimated 0.9 bushel per acre lower than the previous forecast at 168.4 bushels per acre.  Corn production for 2015/16 is estimated 53 million bushels lower, but remains the third largest crop on record at 13.6 billion.  Sorghum production is estimated 3 million bushels higher as an increase in harvested area more than offsets a reduction in yield.Total projected corn use for 2015/16 is reduced slightly with lower projected food, seed, and industrial use and exports.  Feed and residual use is unchanged as September-November disappearance, as indicated by the December 1 stocks, was largely in line with expectations.  Corn used to produce ethanol is unchanged, but projected use for sweeteners is lowered 10 million bushels.  Exports are lowered 50 million bushels based on the slow pace of sales and shipments to date and continued strong competition from South American suppliers.  Corn ending stocks are projected 17 million bushels higher at 1.8 billion bushels, stocks remain the highest since 2005/06.  The projected range for the 2015/16 season-average corn farm price is lowered 5 cents on each end to $3.30 to $3.90 per bushel reflecting weakness in export demand and recent declines in cash and futures prices.  The sorghum farm price is lowered 20 cents at the midpoint to a range of $3.05 to $3.55 per bushel reflecting the weakening relationship to cash corn prices in interior markets.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 6.8 million tons lower mostly on lower corn production for South Africa and the United States and lower rye production for Russia.  Foreign coarse grain supplies are lowered 5.9 million tons.  Corn production is lowered 4.0 million tons for South Africa as continued heat and dryness during December further reduced prospects for area and yields, particularly in the western producing areas where satellite imagery suggests much of this year\u2019s crop may not have been planted.  Russia corn production is lowered 0.5 million tons with reductions in area and yields, but an area increase for Ukraine corn raises production an offsetting 0.5 million tons.  Other corn production changes include small reductions for China and Peru.  Reductions in rye and oats production for Russia more than offset an increase for barley.Global coarse grain consumption for 2015/16 is reduced with the biggest reduction for Russia, down 1.2 million tons with lower rye, oats, and corn consumption reflecting tighter supplies with the smaller crops.  Corn consumption for South Africa is lowered 0.7 million tons with reduced supplies.  Corn consumption is also lowered for Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Pakistan.  Global coarse grain imports for 2015/16 are raised with increases for South Africa, Mexico, and Peru corn more than offsetting reductions in corn imports for China and Saudi Arabia.  Corn exports are raised for Brazil, Mexico, and Ukraine, but lowered for South Africa, India, and Russia.  Corn exports are also raised for Argentina and Brazil for the 2014/15 (March 2015 through February 2016 local year) further reducing prospects for 2015/16 U.S. corn exports (September 2015 through August 2016).   Global 2015/16 corn ending stocks are projected 2.9 million tons lower with reductions for Brazil, China, South Africa, Pakistan, Russia, Argentina, and Saudi Arabia.  World corn ending stocks remain record large at 208.9 million tons; however, more than half of those stocks are held in China. RICE: The U.S. 2015/16 all rice crop is projected at 192.3 million cwt, up 1.6 million from last month.  Long-grain production is up 0.7 million cwt to 133.0 million, and medium- and short-grain is raised 0.9 million cwt to 59.3 million.  The all rice production increase stems from both higher harvested area and yield.  The all rice yield increased 47 pounds per acre to 7,470, and harvested area increased 5,000 acres to 2.58 million.  Imports are lowered 0.5 million cwt to 24.0 million on a slower pace to date.  Changes are made on the use side with domestic and residual lowered 6.0 million cwt and exports raised 4.0 million (both changes are all long-grain).  The reduction in domestic and residual use reflects implied use from the December 1 Rice Stocks report and very strong August-November exports, especially to Latin America.  Ending stocks are projected at 41.9 million cwt, up 3.1 million cwt from last month, but down 6.6 million from the previous year.  The all rice season average price is lowered $0.40 on each end of the range to $12.70 to $13.70 per cwt.  The long-grain price is lowered $0.50 on each end of the range to $11.00-$12.00 per cwt.  The all medium- and short-grain price is lowered $0.40 on each end of the range to $16.60-$17.60 per cwt.  Global 2015/16 rice supplies are raised 0.9 million tons to 574.0 million primarily on increased production.  The largest production gains are 0.3 million tons each for China and the Philippines.  The China increase is on updated government data.  The Philippine increase comes from reported damage related to Typhoon Koppu, that struck a key rice growing region last October, which was less severe than initially thought.  World exports are raised 0.8 million tons to 42.2 million on increased demand, especially in Southeast Asia.  Global consumption is lowered 0.4 million tons to 484.3 million, but remains record large.  Ending stocks are raised 1.3 million tons to 89.7 million, but are still 14.2 million tons below last year and the tightest stocks since 2007/08.  ",
    "October_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for larger production, increased feed and residual use, and nearly unchanged ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.280 billion bushels, up 96 million from last month.  Corn supplies are higher, as a larger crop more than offsets a reduction in beginning stocks based on the Grain Stocks report.  Projected feed and residual use is increased 25 million bushels.  With supply and use changes essentially offsetting, corn ending stocks are up 5 million bushels from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $2.80 to $3.60 per bushel. Grain sorghum production is forecast down from last month, as a 2.4-bushel per acre increase in yield to 72.2 bushels per acre is more than offset by a reduction in harvested area.  Barley and oat production estimates are updated based on the Small Grains report.Global coarse grain production for 2017/18 is forecast up 2.8 million tons to 1,319.4 million.  The 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for greater production, consumption, and reduced stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher, with the largest reductions for Russia, Ukraine, Ethiopia, and Tanzania more than offset by increases for a number of countries including Nigeria, Turkey, and Mozambique.  The projected corn yields for Russia and Ukraine are reduced based on reported harvest results to date.  Historical revisions are made to Nigeria\u2019s corn, sorghum, and millet production estimates to better reflect statistics published by the government. Corn exports are raised for Mexico and Argentina, with largely offsetting reductions for Russia and Ukraine.  Argentina\u2019s 2016/17 exports are lowered for the local marketing year beginning March 2017 reflecting a slower-than-expected pace of exports to date.  Projected 2017/18 food, seed and industrial use for corn in China is raised based on recent trade data indicating a higher-than-expected level of corn product exports.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2017/18 are down from last month, mostly reflecting declines for China and Mexico that are only partially offset by increases for Argentina and Turkey.  Global corn stocks, at 201.0 million, are down 1.5 million from last month.RICE:  The 2017/18 U.S. rice crop is reduced 1.1 million cwt to 178.6 million on lower yields and slightly lower harvested area.  This is the smallest all rice crop since 1996/97.  The average yield forecast is lowered 35 pounds per acre to 7,469.  Decreases in California, Missouri, and Texas are partially offset by an increase in Arkansas.  The long-grain crop is reduced 0.8 million cwt to 126.3 million.  This is the smallest long grain crop since 2011/12.  Medium- and short-grain production is lowered 0.3 million cwt to 52.3 million.  No other supply and demand changes are made this month.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 1.1 million cwt to 27.8 million, which would be the lowest all rice ending stocks in fourteen years.  The all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at a range of $12.70 to $13.70 per cwt. Global rice supplies for 2017/18 are raised 18.3 million tons mainly on a multi-year revision to China\u2019s stocks estimates beginning in 2010/11.  The large multi-year changes in China stocks reflect significant government procurement since 2013 as well as reductions in estimated per capita rice consumption.  For more information see page 11 of the October Grain World Markets and Trade Report (https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/grain-world-markets-and-trade).  Global rice production is increased 0.4 million tons to 483.8 million with increases for Nigeria and Egypt partially offset by a reduction for Bangladesh.  For 2017/18, global trade and total consumption are changed fractionally as a 1.3-million-ton increase in Nigeria\u2019s consumption is partially offset by a 0.7-million-ton reduction for China.  Global 2017/18 ending stocks are raised 18.0 million tons to 141.5 million, the highest since 2000/01.  China is estimated to hold 65 percent of global rice stocks.  ",

Corn production is forecast 30 million bushels lower with harvested area lowered 437,000 acres.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-bushel-per acre increase in the national average corn yield to 168.0 bushels per acre.  Estimated 2015/16 beginning stocks, from the September 30 Grain Stocks report, are nearly unchanged from last month\u2019s projection.  Small revisions to food, seed, and industrial use and trade, based on the latest data, boost 2014/15 feed and residual use 17 million bushels.  Projected U.S. corn usage for 2015/16 is unchanged this month.  Ending stocks are projected 31 million bushels lower to 1,561 million.  The 2015/16 season-average corn price received by producers is projected 5 cents higher on both ends to $3.50 to $4.10 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 8.3 million tons lower mostly on reduced foreign corn beginning stocks and production.  Global corn beginning stocks are lowered 1.2 million tons, reflecting higher 2014/15 EU corn feeding and exports and Ukraine exports.  Global corn production for 2015/16 is lowered 5.5 million tons with reductions for Ukraine, Argentina, India, Philippines, and several Sub-Saharan African countries more than offsetting an increase for Brazil.  Brazil corn production is also raised for 2014/15.  Global 2015/16 production is lowered for rye, millet, sorghum, and barley.  Rye production is lowered for EU.  Millet and sorghum production are lowered for a number of Sub-Saharan African countries.  Barley production is lowered for Russia, but mostly offset by increases for EU, Canada, and Australia.  Mixed grain production is also raised for EU, leaving EU coarse grain production higher on the month.Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is lowered 6.4 million tons with a 4.8-million-ton reduction in corn usage and smaller cuts in rye, millet, and sorghum consumption.  Much of the decline in coarse grain consumption is for those Sub-Saharan African counties with lower output this month; however, reductions are also made for corn consumption in Saudi Arabia, EU, Ukraine, and Philippines, and rye consumption in EU.  Corn trade for 2015/16 is lowered with a reduction in Saudi Arabia imports.  Corn exports are lowered for Ukraine and Argentina but raised for Brazil.  Global 2015/16 corn ending stocks are projected 1.9 million tons lower at 187.8 million, 8.2 million lower than in 2014/15.RICE: U.S. all rice production in 2015/16 is forecast at 187.8 million cwt, down 1.7 million from last month with the decline entirely due to lower yield. The average all rice yield is forecast at 7,307 pounds per acre, down 67 pounds from last month, and the lowest since 2011/12. Yields are lowered for California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; increased for Missouri; and unchanged for Arkansas. All rice harvested area is unchanged at 2.57 million acres. Long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain rice production are both lowered from last month, with long-grain production projected at 130.3 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production at 57.5 million. The all rice import forecast is unchanged at 25.5 million cwt.  All rice domestic and residual use is unchanged at 125.0 million cwt.  All rice exports are unchanged at 97.0 million cwt with long-grain exports projected at 64.0 million and medium- and short-grain exports at 33 million.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 39.8 million cwt, down 1.7 million from last month with long-grain stocks at 21.8 million, and medium- and short-grain at 16.1 million.The 2015/16 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $12.80 to $13.80 per cwt, unchanged from last month.  The medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.30 to $18.30 per cwt, down 20 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price at a midpoint of $21.00 per cwt is unchanged from last month.  The Other States medium- and short-grain rice price at a midpoint of $14.00 per cwt is lowered 50 cents per cwt.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $14.20 to $15.20 per cwt, unchanged from a month ago.Projected global 2015/16 rice ending stocks are reduced on lower supplies. World ending stocks at 88.3 million tons are down 1.9 million from last month and the lowest since 2007/08.  Stocks have dropped 22.5 million tons or 20 percent since 2012/13.  The global stocks-to-use ratio at 18.1 percent is the smallest since 2006/07.  Global rice production is projected at 474.0 million tons, down 1.7 million from last month, primarily due to smaller crops forecast for India and Thailand.   Thailand\u2019s crop is lowered 1.6 million tons, or 9 percent, due to drought and low irrigation supplies in the lower northern region and central plains, as both area harvested and yield are lowered.  India\u2019s crop is lowered 0.5 million tons to 103.5 million due to a 2 percent drop in area harvested.  Global 2015/16 rice consumption is projected at a record 487.5 million tons, up slightly from a month ago.

    "January_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected lower with reduced production estimated for corn and sorghum.  Harvested area for corn is raised 436,000 acres, but the estimated yield is lowered 1.6 bushels per acre to 158.8, reducing production 64 million bushels to 13.9 billion.  Sorghum harvested area is lowered 148,000 acres and the yield is lowered 2.6 bushels per acre, reducing production 27 million bushels.Projected corn use for 2013/14 is raised with feed and residual use projected up 100 million bushels based on September-November disappearance as indicated by the December 1 stocks estimate.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 50 million bushels reflecting continued strong weekly ethanol production, a reduction in expected sorghum use for ethanol, and higher forecast 2014 gasoline consumption in the latest projections from the Energy Information Administration.  A 50-million-bushel reduction in other food, seed, and industrial use offsets the increase in use for ethanol.  Corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 161 million bushels lower at 1.6 billion.  The projected 2013/14 season-average farm price for corn is unchanged at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $4.10 to $4.70 per bushel.Other 2013/14 feed grain changes include increases in projected feed and residual disappearance for sorghum and oats, but a reduction for barley as indicated by December 1 stocks.  Sorghum exports are projected 20 million bushels lower as higher indicated September-November disappearance limits exportable supplies.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use is also lowered 20 million bushels. Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 1.2 million tons higher despite this month\u2019s reduction in U.S. production and a 1.9-million-ton decrease in global beginning stocks.  Higher 2012/13 corn exports for Brazil reduce beginning stocks for 2013/14.  Global barley production for 2013/14 is raised 1.6 million tons with increases for the European Union, Argentina, and Russia.  Foreign corn production is raised 4.3 million tons with higher China production.  China corn production is raised 6.0 million tons reflecting the latest upward revision by the China National Grain and Oil Information Center, indications from the National Bureau of Statistics for total 2013/14 grain production, and review of growing-season weather.  Favorable weather suggests year-to-year yield increases in most of China\u2019s major corn producing areas.  In the northeastern region, above normal rainfall and favorable temperatures were experienced in nearly all of the corn areas.  Harvested area is also raised for China.Partly offsetting the China corn increase are reductions in 2013/14 corn output for Argentina, Russia, and the European Union.  Production is lowered 1.0 million tons for Argentina with lower expected area and reduced prospects for yields following December heat and dryness.  Production is lowered 0.5 million tons for Russia based on the latest government data.  European Union production is lowered 0.3 million tons with a reduction for France.Global 2013/14 coarse grain consumption is raised 4.2 million tons with the higher corn use in the United States and higher barley feeding in the European Union and Russia.  World corn trade for 2013/14 is lowered with a 2.0-million-ton reduction in imports expected for China.  Recent rejections of U.S. corn shipments by China and larger domestic corn supplies in China are expected to limit imports during the 2013/14 marketing year.  China sorghum imports, however, are raised 0.5 million tons.  Corresponding reductions in Mexico sorghum imports and feeding raise corn import needs for Mexico.  Corn imports are raised for Mexico and the Philippines, up 0.5 million tons and 0.3 million tons, respectively.  Corn exports for Argentina are lowered 1.0 million tons also supporting this month\u2019s unchanged U.S. corn export projection.  Global corn ending stocks are projected 2.2 million tons lower with an increase for China more than offset by reductions for the United States and Brazil.RICE:  The U.S. 2013/14 rice crop is estimated at 189.9 million cwt, up 1.2 million from the previous estimate.  Average yield is estimated at a record 7,694 pounds per acre, up 34 pounds per acre.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.468 million acres, up 4,000 acres from the previous estimate.  Long-grain rice production is estimated at 131.9 million cwt, up 2.9 million from last month, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 1.7 million to 58.0 million.  Rice imports for 2013/14 are unchanged from last month.All rice and the long-grain rice 2013/14 domestic and residual use projections are raised 4.0 million cwt from a month ago as indicated by the December 1 stocks with all rice at 120.0 million cwt and long-grain at 88.0 million.  Combined medium- and short-grain domestic and residual use is projected at 32.0 million, unchanged from last month.  The all rice export projection is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 99.0 million\u2014all in the long-grain class.  The pace of exports and sales of long-grain rice have been slow to markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America.  The 2013/14 rough rice export projection is unchanged at 35.0 million cwt.  Exports of milled and brown rice are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 64.0 million (rough-equivalent basis).  All rice ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 28.3 million cwt, down 1.8 million from last month, and a decrease of 22 percent from a year ago.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are forecast at 17.3 million cwt, down slightly from last month, and a decrease of 21 percent from 2012/13.  Combined medium- and short-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 8.7 million cwt, down 1.7 million from last month, and a decline of 29 percent from last year.The Rice Stocks reported total rough rice stocks at 132.8 million cwt as of December 1 and total milled stocks at 6.6 million (9.4 million cwt on a rough-equivalent basis).  Total rice stocks on a rough-equivalent basis are 142.2 million, down 10 percent from a year earlier.  Long-grain stocks as of December 1 are estimated at 89.1 million (rough-equivalent basis) and combined medium- and short-grain stocks at 50.3 million.The 2013/14 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $14.80 to $15.80 per cwt, unchanged from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $16.30 to $17.30 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $15.30 to $16.30 per cwt, down 10 cents per cwt on both ends of the range.Global total supplies of rice for 2013/14 are raised more than the increase in total use resulting in an increase in world ending stocks.  Global rice production is projected at 471.2 million tons, still a record, and up 0.5 million from last month due primarily to increased forecasts for Brazil, Pakistan, and the United States.  Brazil\u2019s crop is raised 0.1 million tons because of an increase in area.  Pakistan\u2019s rice crop is raised 0.4 million tons because of an increase in average yield.  The U.S. rice crop is up on both an increase in area and yield.  Beginning stocks for 2013/14 are increased 0.6 million tons from last month due mostly to increases for Pakistan and Thailand.  Global consumption for 2013/14 is forecast at a record 473.1 million tons due mostly to increases for Brazil and the United States.  Export projections are raised for Argentina and Pakistan, and lowered slightly for the United States.  Imports are raised for the Philippines\u2014up 0.2 million tons to 1.4 million.  Global rice ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 105.2 million tons, up 0.9 million from last month, but a decrease of 1.9 million from the prior year.  Ending stocks projections are raised for Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.",
    "April_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected higher with increases for corn, barley, and oats, only partly offset by a reduction for sorghum.  Projected corn ending stocks are raised 50 million bushels with a reduction in expected feed and residual use reflecting December-February disappearance as indicated by March 1 stocks.  Barley feed and residual use is lowered 5 million bushels, also on indications from March 1 stocks.  Oats stocks are projected higher with a 3-million-bushel increase in imports based on the pace of trade to date.  The projected range for the corn season-average farm price is narrowed 5 cents on each end to $3.55 to $3.85 per bushel.A number of significant changes are made this month to the 2014/15 U.S. sorghum balance sheet to accommodate the continuing strong demand from China.  Domestic sorghum use is lowered 41 million tons with decreases projected for food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use and for feed and residual disappearance.  FSI use is lowered 16 million bushels reflecting use for ethanol production to date from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report which indicated that use for ethanol dropped to zero in February.  Feed and residual use is projected 25 million bushels lower.  Projected exports are raised 50 million bushels based on the continued strong pace of shipments and large outstanding sales.  Ending stocks are expected 9 million bushels lower.  The season-average sorghum farm price is projected at $3.85 to $4.15 per bushel, up 10 cents at the midpoint of the range and 30 cents higher than the corn farm price.U.S. sorghum feed and residual use for 2014/15 is projected at 85 million bushels, despite indicated feed and residual disappearance for the first half of the marketing year (September-February) of 154 million bushels.  Early harvested 2015-crop sorghum, particularly from Texas, is expected to augment 2014/15 marketing year supplies and support exports at 350 million bushels during the 2014/15 marketing year that ends August 31.  The Prospective Plantings report indicated that Texas producers intend to increase sorghum plantings by 20 percent for 2015.  Last year, more than 80 percent of the Texas sorghum crop was mature by mid-August.  These additional supplies, exported before the September 1 start of the new marketing year, push feed and residual use during the second half of 2014/15 (March-August) well into negative territory.  These supplies will also boost first-quarter (September-November) feed and residual disappearance in the 2015/16 marketing year, as in 2014/15.  NOTE:  For additional information on this month\u2019s sorghum changes see the April 13 Feed Outlook available from the Economic Research Service at www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn.aspx.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 4.2 million tons higher with much of the increase reflecting higher sorghum and millet output in Sudan.  There are a number of smaller changes to corn, sorghum, and millet production in several other countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.  Elsewhere, corn production is raised for Serbia, Mexico, and Argentina, up 0.9 million tons, 0.8 million tons, and 0.5 million tons, respectively.  The change for Serbia is based on the latest government revisions for the crop that was grown last summer.  Heavy fall rains delayed harvesting and the final tally for that crop.  Production is raised for Mexico reflecting the latest government statistics for the crop grown last summer.  Increased area, exceptional winter rains, and plentiful supplies of irrigation water support prospects for the winter crop that was planted in the final months of 2014.  The increase for Argentina is based on early harvest results that suggest very good yields in early planted corn and abundant soil moisture for the later planted corn now in grain fill.  In addition to last month\u2019s reduction of 2.0 million tons, the South Africa corn crop is lowered an additional 0.2 million tons based on further analysis of weather and satellite imagery.Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised slightly, mostly on higher sorghum and millet food use for Sudan.  China sorghum feed use is also raised, up 1.5 million tons with higher expected sorghum imports from the United States.  Indonesia corn feeding is raised 0.4 million tons, more than offsetting a decrease in FSI use.  Lower domestic use of corn, sorghum, and barley in the United States offset much of these increases.  Global corn trade is raised for 2014/15 with imports higher for Indonesia, China, Iran, Algeria, Peru, and Colombia.  Partly offsetting is a reduction in imports for Mexico with the larger crop.  Corn exports are raised for Argentina and Serbia, but lowered for South Africa.  Global coarse grain ending stocks are higher with corn stocks projected up 3.2 million tons mostly on increases for the United States, Indonesia, and China.RICE:  U.S. all rice 2014/15 supply and use changes result in a 1.5 million cwt increase in ending stocks to 42.4 million, up 33 percent from the previous year.  Long-grain ending stocks are increased 0.5 million to 27.6 million, and combined medium- and short-grain ending stocks are increased 1.0 million to 12.5 million.  All rice imports are raised 0.5 million (all in long-grain) to 23.5 million as imports from Thailand were strong in February according to the U.S. Census Bureau trade data.  No other changes are made on the supply side.  Total 2014/15 all rice use is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 234.0 million\u2014all in combined medium- and short-grain rice.  All rice domestic and residual use is lowered 2.0 million cwt to 129.0 million with long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain each reduced 1.0 million to 98.0 million and 31.0 million, respectively.  Partially offsetting the decrease in domestic and residual use is a 1.0 million cwt increase in all rice exports to 105.0 million (all in long-grain) as exports increased recently to Western Hemisphere markets.  Long-grain exports are forecast at 73.0 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain exports at 32.0 million.The decrease in 2014/15 all rice domestic and residual use is based primarily on total use implied from USDA\u2019s Rice Stocks report on March 31.  USDA\u2019s March 1 rice stocks were higher than expected and above trade expectations.  All rice March 1 stocks totaled 120.8 million cwt (rough-equivalent basis), up 24 percent from the previous year, and the highest since 2011.  Implied all rice domestic and residual use for December-February 2014/15 was down 8 percent from the previous market year, and 5 percent below the previous 4-year average. The 2014/15 long-grain season-average price at the midpoint is projected at $12.30 per cwt, down 20 cents per cwt from a month ago and down $3.10 per cwt from last year.  The all combined medium- and short-grain season-average price at the midpoint is forecast at $18.60 per cwt, up 10 cents per cwt from last month, but 60 cents per cwt below a year ago.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price is raised slightly from last month and the Other States price is unchanged.  The all rice price at the midpoint is projected at $14.20 per cwt, down 10 cents per cwt from last month, and $2.10 per cwt below 2013/14.Global 2014/15 rice ending stocks are increased 0.9 million tons as the decrease in use adds to a slight increase in supplies.  Global consumption (includes residual) is lowered nearly 0.65 million tons as projected use is lowered for Indonesia, Japan, and the United States, partially offset by increases for Pakistan and Thailand.  Total rice supplies in 2014/15 are increased 0.3 million tons due to an increase in beginning stocks (+0.6 million) more than offsetting a reduction in production (-0.3 million).  The rise in global beginning stocks is due primarily to increases for Japan, Pakistan, and Taiwan.  The reduction in global 2014/15 rice production results mainly from decreases for Indonesia, Vietnam, and Sub-Saharan Africa, partially offset by an increase for Pakistan.  Global rice exports for 2014/15 are lowered slightly due to reductions for Egypt, Japan, and Pakistan, partially offset by increases for Brazil, and the United States.  Imports are lowered slightly for Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, but raised for the United States.",
    "February_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is little changed relative to last month, with offsetting changes to exports and corn used for ethanol.  Exports are lowered 50 million bushels, reflecting the slow pace of shipments through January.  Offsetting is a 50 million bushel increase in corn used for ethanol, based on Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production data through December and the robust pace of weekly ethanol production data as reported by the Energy Information Administration during the month of January.  With no other use changes, U.S. corn ending stocks are unchanged from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is also unchanged at $3.85 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2019/20 is projected 0.9 million tons higher to 1,402.7 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production and consumption, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Global corn production is raised 0.8 million tons, with increases for South Africa, Moldova, and Ukraine more than offsetting a reduction for Vietnam.  For South Africa, production is higher as timely rainfall during the month of January improves yield prospects. Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include higher projected corn exports for South Africa, Ukraine, and the EU, with a largely offsetting reduction for the United States.  Corn imports are raised for Turkey and Brazil, with the latter reflecting larger-than-expected shipments to livestock production areas in the southern part of the country.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for Vietnam, Brazil, Paraguay, and the EU.  Global corn ending stocks, at 296.8 million tons, are down 1.0 million from last month.   RICE: This month\u2019s outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice is for increased imports, higher exports, and larger ending stocks.  All rice imports are raised 2.4 million cwt to a record 32.5 million on an extremely fast pace so far in the market year.  Long-grain imports are raised 1.5 million cwt consisting largely of fragrant varieties from Asia.  Combined medium- and short-grain imports are raised 0.9 million cwt on continued imports from China.  Total rice exports are raised 1.0 million cwt (all long-grain) reflecting a strong pace of shipments so far in the market year and an abnormally large outstanding sales balance.  All rice ending stocks are raised 1.4 million cwt to 30.0 million and the season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per cwt to $13.00, still the highest price in 5 years.  Global 2019/20 rice supplies are raised fractionally with higher beginning stocks mostly offset by lower production.  Global exports are lowered 0.8 million tons led by a 0.6-million-ton decrease for India reflecting a slowing pace.  Global imports are down 0.4 million tons and world consumption is down 0.9 million; both reflecting several downward revisions.  With supplies higher and consumption lower, global ending stocks are raised 1.0 million tons to a record high 178.1 million.",
    "May_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected at a record 400.5 million tons, up 25 percent from 2012/13 with higher area and yields expected for corn, sorghum, and oats.  Corn production for 2013/14 is projected at 14.1 billion bushels, up 3.4 billion from 2012/13 when extreme drought and heat reduced yields to their lowest levels since 1995/96.  The 2013/14 corn yield is projected at 158.0 bushels per acre, 5.6 bushels below the weather adjusted trend presented at USDA\u2019s Agricultural Outlook Forum in February (www.usda.gov/oce/forum/presentations/Westcott_Jewison.pdf).  The slow start to this year\u2019s planting and the likelihood that progress by mid-May will remain well behind the 10-year average reduce prospects for yields.  Corn supplies for 2013/14 are projected at a record 14.9 billion bushels, up 3.0 billion from 2012/13.U.S. corn use for 2013/14 is projected up 16 percent from 2012/13 on higher feed and residual disappearance, increased use for ethanol, sweeteners, and starch, and a partial recovery in exports.  Feed and residual use for 2013/14 is projected up 925 million bushels reflecting a sharp rebound in residual disappearance with the record crop and an increase in feeding with lower corn prices.  Projected corn use for ethanol is increased 250 million bushels from this month\u2019s higher projection for 2012/13.  Lower corn prices and high prices for Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) support profitability for ethanol producers. U.S. corn exports for 2013/14 are projected 550 million bushels higher than this month\u2019s lower projection for 2012/13.  At the projected 1.3 billion bushels, 2013/14 exports are expected to rebound from their lowest level since 1970/71.  An expected fourth straight year of record foreign corn production with large crops in South America and the FSU-12 will provide substantial competition for the United States.  U.S. corn ending stocks are projected at 2.0 billion bushels, up 1.2 billion from 2012/13.  The season-average farm price at $4.30 to $5.10 per bushel is down sharply from the record $6.70 to $7.10 for 2012/13.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected at a record 1,407.6 million tons, up 113.8 million from 2012/13.  Global corn production for 2013/14 is projected at a record 965.9 million tons.  Foreign corn production is up 23.5 million tons.  The largest increases are projected for the FSU-12, EU-27, and China, but large crops are again expected in 2013/14 for Brazil and Argentina.  Global corn trade is projected higher with increased imports for China more than offsetting a reduction for EU-27.  Spurred by lower prices, smaller year-to-year import increases are projected for a number of countries.  Exports are lowered for Brazil, India, and Argentina, but raised for Ukraine and EU-27.  World corn consumption is projected at a record 936.7 million tons, up 72.8 million from 2012/13 with foreign consumption up 41.5 million.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected up 29.2 million tons on the year.  At 154.6 million tons, stocks would be a 13-year high.RICE:  Tighter U.S. 2013/14 all rice supplies, forecast down 6 percent from 2012/13 and lower projected use, down 7 percent from 2012/13 result in ending stocks that are down 3 percent from the previous year.  Beginning stocks and production for 2013/14 are both forecast lower from a year ago, while imports are forecast 5 percent larger.  U.S. rice production for 2013/14 is projected at 189.5 million cwt, down 5 percent from 2012/13.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.59 million acres based on average harvested-to-planted ratios for the previous 5 years, the lowest area since 1987/88.  Average all rice yield is projected at 7,317 pounds per acre, down 2 percent from the previous year\u2019s record.  U.S. 2013/14 all rice total use is projected at a 213.0 million cwt, 7 percent below the previous year.  Domestic and residual use is projected at 115.0 million cwt, 4 percent below 2012/13.  All rice exports are projected at 98.0 million cwt, 9 percent below 2012/13, and the lowest since 2008/09.  Long-grain rice exports are projected at 69.0 million, 10 percent below the previous year, and combined medium- and short-grain rice exports at 29.0 million, 7 percent below 2012/13.  U.S. long-grain exports will be limited by a tighter U.S. supply situation, and increased competition among the major South American and Asian exporters.  Exports of medium-grain rice will be constrained by tighter U.S. supplies and greater competition from Egypt and Australia.  U.S. all rice ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 33.1 million cwt, 3 percent below the previous year.  Long-grain ending stocks are forecast at 21.9 million cwt, 7 percent above 2012/13, and combined medium- and short-grain rice stocks at 9.0 million, 22 percent below the previous year.  The U.S. 2013/14 long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $13.80 to $14.80 per cwt, compared to a revised $14.20 to $14.60 for the previous year.  The combined medium- and short-grain price is projected at $15.50 to $16.50 per cwt, compared to a revised $15.80 to $16.20 for the year earlier.  The 2013/14 all rice price is projected at $14.30 to $15.30 per cwt, compared to a revised $14.70 to $15.10 per cwt for 2012/13. Global 2013/14 total supply and use are each projected to reach record levels at 584.7 and 476.8 million tons, respectively, resulting in a 2.4-million increase in world ending stocks. Global 2013/14 rice production is projected at a record 479.3 million tons, up 9.0 million from 2012/13.  Record to near-record rice crops are projected in Asia.  Record crops are projected for the major exporters including India, Thailand, and Vietnam. Additionally, large crops are forecast for other exporters including Burma, Cambodia, and Egypt.  On the importer side, record or near-record crops are forecast for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Global 2013/14 consumption is projected at a record 476.8 million tons, up 1 percent from the previous year.  Global exports in 2013/14 are projected at 38.9 million tons, up marginally from 2012/13.  India and Thailand are forecast to be the largest global rice exporters in 2013/14 with exports of 8.5 million tons each followed by Vietnam at 7.7 million tons.  Large 2013/14 imports are projected for China, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa with Nigeria the largest in that region.  China\u2019s imports have surged since 2011/12\u2014forecast to be 2.9 million tons in 2012/13 and 3.0 million in 2013/14\u2014making China the largest global rice importer in 2013/14.  China\u2019s annual consumption needs have overtaken production since 2012/13.  Strong domestic prices in China have encouraged imports of lower-priced rice from Burma, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  Global 2013/14 ending stocks are expected to increase 2.4 million tons to 107.8 million, the largest since 2001/02.  ",
    "March_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are unchanged this month with only small offsetting increases for barley imports and exports and no changes to supply and use projections for the other feed grains.  The projected season-average farm price ranges are narrowed 5 cents on each end for corn, sorghum, and barley, leaving the midpoints of the ranges unchanged on the month.  The midpoint for the projected corn price remains $3.60 per bushel.  The oats farm price range is projected 10 cents lower on the high end reducing the midpoint by 5 cents to $2.15 per bushel based on the latest reported prices.Corn food, seed, and industrial use is lowered slightly for 2014/15 reflecting a 9-million-bushel reduction in estimated corn used in ethanol production based on revisions to monthly data reported in the March 1 Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production 2015 Summary.  An offsetting change is made to 2014/15 feed and residual use as trade and ending stocks are known.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 1.6 million tons lower.  Much of the decline reflects lower corn beginning stocks for Brazil with 2014/15 exports raised this month.  Global 2015/16 coarse grain production is lowered with reductions for South Africa and Philippines corn and India millet more than offsetting an increase for Indonesia corn.    Corn production is lowered 0.5 million tons for South Africa with a continuation of drought reducing area and yield prospects further.  Philippines corn production and India millet production are each lowered 0.3 million tons on lower yields resulting from dryness.  Indonesia corn production is raised 0.3 million tons with higher expected area reflecting both an increase to reported area for 2014/15 and indications that reduced rice planting will boost corn area in 2015/16.  Global coarse grain consumption for 2015/16 is raised 0.5 million tons with higher corn use for India and South Africa and increased barley feeding for China more than offsetting a reduction in corn use for Venezuela.  Global 2015/16 coarse grain imports are raised.  Corn imports are increased for South Africa, Philippines, and Mexico and barley imports are raised for China.  Partly offsetting are small reductions in corn imports for Indonesia and Venezuela.  Corn exports are raised for Indonesia and South Africa, with the increase for South Africa reflecting higher expected trade with neighboring countries where drought has also affected corn production.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are lowered with corn ending stocks down 1.8 million tons mostly reflecting smaller stocks in Brazil. RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 rice exports are lowered 2.0 million cwt this month to 100.0 million on reduced shipments of southern medium-grain rough rice, especially to Turkey.  Rice ending stocks are raised 2.0 million cwt to 43.9 million.  The all rice price is lowered $0.10 at both ends of the range to $12.40 to $13.20 reflecting lower projected medium- and short-grain prices.  Global rice supplies for 2015/16 are raised 1.8 million tons primarily on increased production.  The largest production change is a 3.0-million-ton increase for India on updated government statistics.  This is partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton decrease for Indonesia on lower area, caused by a poor start to the rainy season.  Global imports are raised 0.4 million tons led by a 0.3-million-ton increase for China and a 0.1-million-ton increase for Indonesia.  The China increase is on the import pace to date and the Indonesia increase is on the smaller crop.  Export changes are very small and mostly offsetting.  World rice consumption for 2015/16 is raised 0.6 million tons and remains a record.  Consumption is up 0.9 million tons for India and 0.3 million tons for China, both on larger supplies.  The largest offsetting reduction is 0.2 million tons for Indonesia on the smaller crop.  With the increase in supplies exceeding the rise in consumption, global ending stocks are raised 1.2 million tons to 90.5 million.  ",
    "March_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for increased corn used to produce ethanol and reduced feed and residual use.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 50 million bushels to 5,400 million based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and strong pace of weekly ethanol production during February as indicated by Energy Information Administration data.  Offsetting is a 50 million bushel reduction in projected feed and residual use to 5,550 million bushels based on indicated use during 2015/16, increased corn used to produce ethanol, and higher expected sorghum feeding.  Ending stocks are unchanged from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $3.20 to $3.60 per bushel. Corn for food, seed, and industrial use (FSI) is raised 11 million bushels for 2015/16 reflecting a 18-million-bushel increase in estimated corn used in ethanol production based on revisions to monthly data reported in the March 1 Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production 2016 Summary.  Partially offsetting is a marginal reduction in non-ethanol FSI.  With stocks and trade known, a change is made to feed and residual use.Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast 12.7 million tons higher from last month to 1,341.7 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for increased production, consumption, trade, and stocks relative to last month.  Brazil corn production is raised on increases to both projected area and yield.  Reported first crop yields have been record high, while the rapid planting progress of second crop corn in the Center-West boosts expected area and yield prospects, allowing for greater crop development prior to the normal end of the rainy season.  South Africa corn production is higher as above normal rainfall and benign temperatures during grain fill support an increased yield forecast.  India corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics.  Argentina corn production is increased based on higher-than-expected yield results for early-planted corn and indications of larger planted area.  Barley production for Australia is projected sharply higher based on the latest information from ABARES.Major global trade changes for 2016/17 this month include higher projected corn exports for Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa.  Corn imports are raised for Iran, while barley imports are raised for Saudi Arabia and China.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month, mostly reflecting increases for Brazil, Argentina, Iran and South Africa.  RICE:  The U.S. 2016/17 rice supply and demand estimates are unchanged this month.  The all rice marketing year average price is also unchanged with the midpoint of the range at $10.50 per cwt.  Medium-and short-grain prices are raised slightly.  Global rice production is minimally increased to 480.4 million tons with Brazil accounting for all of the increase.  World exports are modestly reduced as lower exports by Australia, India, and Vietnam are only partially offset by increases for Brazil and China.  Global use is fractionally raised this month, resulting in projected ending stocks declining to 117.7 million tons, which is still the highest level since 2001/02.",
    "February_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is for higher exports and lower ending stocks.  Exports are raised 50 million bushels, reflecting historically large corn purchases by China. With no other use changes, U.S. corn ending stocks are lowered 50 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 10 cents to $4.30 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2020/21 is projected marginally higher to 1,438.9 million tons.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for higher production, lower consumption, and greater ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is up fractionally, with an increase for South Africa more than offsetting a reduction for Paraguay.  For South Africa, production is raised based on higher indicated area.  For Brazil, the corn production forecast is unchanged as greater area is offset by a reduction in yield.  Slow second-crop planting progress in the Center-West dampens yield prospects but very favorable prices boost area expectations.Major global trade changes for 2020/21 include higher projected corn exports for the United States, India, and South Africa.  For 2019/20, Argentina and Brazil corn exports are raised for the local marketing year ending February 2021 based on larger-than-expected late-season shipments.  Corn imports for 2020/21 are increased for China, with partly offsetting reductions for the EU-27+UK, South Korea, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.  China\u2019s barley and sorghum imports are also higher this month, bringing total coarse grain imports to 40.3 million tons.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are up relative to last month, mostly reflecting increases for China, South Africa, and Mexico that are partly offset by reductions for Argentina and Brazil.  Global corn ending stocks, at 286.5 million tons, are up 2.7 million from last month.   RICE:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for stable supplies and domestic use, lower exports, and higher ending stocks.  Exports are lowered by 1.0 million cwt to 93.0 million, all for long-grain on the continued sluggish pace of sales and shipments for long-grain milled rice.  Projected 2020/21 all rice ending stocks are raised by an equivalent amount to 39.4 million cwt.  The projected 2020/21 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per cwt to $13.40 with increases in the NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.   The 2020/21 global outlook is for larger supplies, higher consumption, increased trade, and reduced stocks.  Rice supplies are raised 0.8 million tons to 682.3 million, primarily on higher rice production for Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines as global production is raised to a record high 504.0 million.  World 2020/21 consumption is increased 2.2 million tons to a record 504.2 million.  The largest increase is for China, where more old-crop rice is expected to be fed due to rising domestic corn prices.  World trade is raised 0.9 million tons to 46.3 million as higher exports by India more than offset reduced exports by Thailand.  India\u2019s exports are increased to a record 15.0 million tons as its supplies remain ample and its export prices continue to be the most competitive among major exporters.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 1.4 million tons to 178.1 million, primarily on higher domestic use for China and larger exports for India.   ",
    "April_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected lower this month with reductions for corn, barley, and oats.  A 125-million-bushel increase in projected corn exports reduces corn ending stocks by the same amount.  Continued strong export sales and a rising weekly shipment pace for U.S. corn during March support the higher expected export level as does an increase in projected global corn demand.  U.S. barley ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 7 million bushels lower with projected imports decreased and projected exports increased based on the pace of shipments to date.  Oats ending stocks are projected 10 million bushels lower with feed and residual use raised 10 million bushels on higher-than-expected December-February disappearance as indicated by the March 1 stocks.  Sorghum exports are projected 20 million bushels higher based on the high level of outstanding sales and the sharp increase in weekly shipments during March.  Sorghum ending stocks, however, remain unchanged with an offsetting reduction made in domestic use based on the higher-than-expected March 1 stocks estimate.The 2013/14 season-average farm price for corn is raised 10 cents at the midpoint with the projected range also narrowed to $4.40 to $4.80 per bushel, compared with $4.25 to $4.75 per bushel last month.  The projected range for the sorghum farm price is also raised 10 cents to $4.15 to $4.55 per bushel.  The barley and oats price ranges are narrowed 5 cents on each end to $6.00 to $6.20 per bushel and $3.65 to $3.75 per bushel, respectively.  The June-May marketing year for barley and oats is nearing an end with most of the two crops already marketed and priced.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are raised 3.6 million tons with increases in foreign corn production far exceeding reductions for millet, sorghum, and barley.  Revisions to coarse grain production for a number of Sub-Saharan African countries account for much of the change in world production this month.  Notable changes, however, are made for several major producing and exporting countries.  Global corn production is raised 6.4 million tons with a 2.0-million-ton increase for Brazil and 1.0-million-ton increases each for South Africa and Russia.  For Brazil, favorable precipitation in March and early April has supported the developing safrinha corn crop with yields now expected just below last year\u2019s levels in the areas where this second-season corn crop is grown.  For South Africa, improved rains in late February and March have boosted yield prospects for corn grown in the normally lower-yielding western areas.  Corn production is raised for Russia based on recent revisions to official production statistics.  Corn production is also raised 0.2 million tons for Mexico, in line with the latest government estimates.  Global sorghum production is lowered 1.1 million tons mostly on changes to the Sub-Saharan Africa countries, but production is also lowered 0.4 million tons for Argentina and raised 0.3 million tons for Brazil.  Global barley production is lowered with a 0.8-million-ton reduction for China.  Global millet production is reduced 1.7 million tons with more than half of the decline for India.     Global coarse grain trade for 2013/14 is raised with higher corn and sorghum imports.  Corn imports are increased for the European Union, Algeria, Iran, Egypt, and Vietnam.  In addition to the United States, corn exports are increased for South Africa, Ukraine, Mexico, Russia, and Vietnam.  Sorghum imports are raised for China.  Global corn consumption is higher with increases in feeding for Argentina, Russia, and Algeria.  A reduction in European Union corn feeding is more than offset by an increase in food, seed, and industrial use.  Corn use is also raised for several of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries led by increases of 1.0 million tons for Uganda and 0.9 million tons for Ethiopia.  World corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are lowered 0.5 million tons with reductions for the United States and Ukraine outweighing increases for Brazil, Russia, and several other countries.RICE:  No changes are made on the supply side of the U.S. all rice and rice-by-class 2013/14 balance sheets.  Total 2013/14 all rice use is raised 1.0 million cwt to 221.0 million\u2014all on the combined medium- and short-grain rice side.  All rice domestic and residual use is increased 4.0 million cwt to 124.0 million with long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain domestic and residual use each raised 2.0 million to 91.0 million and 33.0 million, respectively.  Partially offsetting the increase in domestic and residual use is a 3.0 million cwt decline in projected total exports to 97.0 million\u2014the lowest since 2008/09.  The 2013/14 long-grain export projection is lowered 2.0 million cwt to 65.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain exports are lowered 1.0 million to 32.0 million.  The rough rice export projection is lowered 2.0 million to 33.0 million, and milled exports are lowered 1.0 million (rough-equivalent basis) to 64.0 million.  The export pace has dropped off to some markets in the Western Hemisphere including Venezuela, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Haiti, largely due to stronger competition from exporters in South America and Vietnam.  Additionally, U.S. exports to African markets and Japan have been slower than expected.The increase in domestic and residual use is based primarily on total use implied from the March 1 rice stocks, as reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service on March 31.  USDA\u2019s March 1 rice stocks were lower than expected and lower than most trade expectations.  The all rice 2013/14 August 1 stocks are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 27.3 million, the lowest since 2003/04\u2014all in combined medium- and short-grain stocks. The 2013/14 long-grain season-average price range is forecast at $15.30 to $15.90 per cwt, unchanged from last month, and with the midpoint forecast at $15.60 per cwt\u2014the highest on record (series starts in 1982/83).  The medium- and short-grain season-average price range is forecast at $19.70 to $20.30 per cwt, up $1.00 per cwt on each end of the range from a month ago, and with the midpoint forecast at $20.00 per cwt\u2014the highest price since the 2008/09 record of $24.80 per cwt.  The all rice season-average price range is forecast at $16.60 to $17.20 per cwt, up 30 cents on each end of the range, and with the midpoint at $16.90 per cwt\u2014the highest price on record.  The reduced prospects for 2014/15 medium- and short-grain production in the Sacramento Valley of California due to drought and reduced irrigation supplies have significantly raised medium-grain prices in California.  USDA\u2019s Prospective Plantings (March 31) reported intended plantings of medium-grain rice in California at 420,000 acres, down 18 percent from the previous year and the smallest since 1998.  Additionally, old-crop supplies of medium-grain rice in California are drawing down, tightening the current supply situation.  Finally, Australia\u2019s drought is also increasing medium-grain prices as Australia is a major exporter of medium-grain rice and a primary U.S. export competitor.The global 2013/14 rice supply and use balance sheet has changed little compared to a month ago, despite many country-level supply and use changes.  World rice production is increased 0.8 million tons to a record 475.6 million tons, primarily due to larger projections for Brazil, Pakistan, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Global consumption is raised 0.5 million tons, largely due to increases for Brazil, South Korea, Sub-Saharan Africa, Vietnam, and the United States.  Global rice trade for 2013/14 is nearly unchanged from a month ago at 40.8 million tons; however, there were some significant country-level changes including increases in exports for Pakistan and Thailand; and decreases for Vietnam and the United States.  On the importer side, projected rice imports for 2013/14 are raised for Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Global 2013/14 ending stocks at 111.2 million tons are down 0.5 million from last month, but up 1.0 million from the prior year.  Ending stocks projections are raised for China, Brazil, and the European Union, but reduced for Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States.",
    "January_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected lower with a reduction in corn production more than offsetting an increase in sorghum.  Harvested area for corn is increased slightly, but the national average yield is estimated 2.4 bushel per acre lower at 171.0 bushels per acre.  Corn production is estimated 191 million bushels lower.  Yield and production, however, both remain records.  Sorghum production is raised 25 million bushels with increases estimated for both harvested area and yield.Total projected corn use for 2014/15 is reduced 75 million bushels with lower feed and residual use only partly offset by an increase in corn used for ethanol production.  Feed and residual use is lowered 100 million bushels with the smaller crop and reflecting September-November disappearance as indicated by the December 1 stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is raised 25 million bushels mostly offsetting a reduction in expected sorghum use for ethanol.  Corn ending stocks are projected 121 million bushels lower.  The projected range for the season-average corn farm price is raised 15 cents on each end to $3.35 to $3.95 per bushel.Other 2014/15 U.S. feed grain changes reflect the continued strong pace of sorghum export sales and shipments to China and changes in feed and residual disappearance as indicated by the December 1 stocks.  Sorghum exports are raised 40 million bushels.  Domestic sorghum use is lowered 10 million bushels with a reduction in food, seed, and industrial use partly offset by higher feed and residual use.  Barley feed and residual use is lowered 10 million bushels based on June-November disappearance as indicated by the December 1 stocks.  The sorghum farm price range is raised 30 cents on each end to $3.50 to $4.10 per bushel and higher than the projected corn price because of the large share of use coming from exports this year.  The barley farm price range is raised 10 cents at the midpoint to $5.00 to $5.50 per bushel based on higher-than-expected prices for feed barley reported to date.  The oats farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on each end to $3.10 to $3.40 per bushel. Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 3.7 million tons lower as a result of this month\u2019s reduction in the U.S. corn crop.  Foreign coarse grain supplies are raised slightly with higher corn production for India and EU and higher barley production for Ethiopia.  India corn production is raised 1.0 million tons with higher-than-expected plantings reported for its winter crop.  EU corn production is raised 0.4 million tons with higher production reported for Spain, Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria.  Offsetting these increases is a 0.4-million-ton reduction for Brazil sorghum with lower expected area.  Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is reduced slightly as lower domestic use in the United States is mostly offset by higher corn use for Ethiopia, EU, India, and Canada.  Sorghum consumption is raised for China, but lowered for Brazil and Japan.  Barley consumption is raised slightly with increases for Ethiopia and Iran.  Global coarse grain exports are up 1.3 million tons with most of the increase for sorghum.  Sorghum exports are raised for the United States and imports are raised for China but lowered for Japan.  Barley exports are raised for Australia and Kazakhstan with imports raised for Iran and Tunisia.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2014/15 are lowered 3.3 million tons mostly on lower projected corn stocks in the United States.  Corn ending stocks are also lowered for Argentina with an increase this month in 2013/14 exports. RICE:  The U.S. 2014/15 rice crop is estimated at 221.0 million cwt, down fractionally from the previous estimate.  Average yield is estimated at 7,572 pounds per acre, down 25 pounds per acre.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.919 million acres, up 9,000 acres from the previous estimate with most of the increase in Arkansas.  Long-grain rice production is estimated at 162.4 million cwt, up 2.1 million from last month, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 2.2 million to 58.7 million.  All rice imports for 2014/15 are increased 1.0 million cwt to 22.0 million due primarily to a large shipment of long-grain broken rice from Vietnam reported in the November trade data released by the U.S. Census Bureau. The all rice 2014/15 domestic and residual use projection is unchanged at 131.0 million as implied by the December 1 stocks.  Long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain rice domestic and residual use are both unchanged from a month ago and projected at 99.0 million and 32.0 million, respectively.  The all rice export projection is unchanged at 103.0 million cwt; however, the long-grain export projection is raised 1.0 million cwt to 70.0 million and the combined medium- and short-grain forecast is lowered to 33.0 million.  The boost in the long-grain export projection is due primarily to increased exports of rough rice to Latin America as reported in the November trade data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The 2014/15 all rice rough export projection is unchanged at 35.0 million cwt and the milled and brown rice component is unchanged at 68.0 million (rough rice equivalent basis).  All rice ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 40.9 million cwt, up 1.0 million from last month, and an increase of 28 percent from a year ago.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are forecast at 29.1 million cwt, up 2.1 million from last month.  Combined medium- and short-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 9.5 million cwt, down 1.2 million from last month.The 2014/15 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $11.70 to $12.70 per cwt, down 30 cents per cwt on each end from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $18.00 to $19.00 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each end from a month ago.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $13.60 to $14.60 per cwt, down 40 cents per cwt on each end.  The decrease in the price projections is due to lower-than-expected prices reported in the December issue of Agricultural Prices released by USDA and price expectations the remainder of the marketing year.Global 2014/15 rice supply and use is changed very little from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at 475.5 million tons up 0.2 million from last month, but down 1.5 million from the record 2013/14 crop.  The increase in the 2014/15 crop is primarily due to an increase for Paraguay which is partially offset by a drop in Brazil.  Global consumption for 2014/15 is increased 0.4 million tons to a record 483.3 million tons with small increases distributed among several countries.  The export projection for 2014/15 is raised 0.7 million tons to a record 42.6 million due primarily to increases for Burma, Guyana, Paraguay, and Thailand.  Imports are raised for Bolivia, Haiti, Syria, and the United States.  Global rice ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 99.0 million tons, down 0.1 million from last month, and a decrease of 7.9 million from the prior year.  Ending stocks projections are lowered for Brazil and Thailand, but increased for Bangladesh and the United States.",
    "October_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2014/15 U.S. feed grain production is raised this month as higher forecast corn production more than offsets a reduction for sorghum and the lower estimates for barley and oats from the Small Grains 2014 Summary.  Corn production is forecast 80 million bushels higher at a record 14,475 million bushels as lower reported area is more than offset by a 2.5-bushel-per-acre increase in the yield.  Corn supplies for 2014/15 are projected at 15,736 million bushels, up 129 million from last month reflecting both higher production and a 55-million-bushel increase in beginning stocks from the September Grain Stocks report.  Projected imports are lowered 5 million bushels with tighter corn supplies in Canada.Projected U.S. corn use for 2014/15 is raised 50 million bushels on higher expected feed and residual disappearance driven by the larger crop, higher projected meat production, and the lower price outlook.  Corn ending stocks are raised 79 million bushels to 2,081 million.  The projected range for the season-average farm price is lowered 10 cents on each end to $3.10 to $3.70 per bushel.Projected sorghum supplies for 2014/15 are lowered 12 million bushels as a 26-million-bushel reduction in forecast production more than outweighs higher beginning stocks as reported in the Grain Stocks report.  Exports are projected 20 million bushels higher on strong demand from China.  Domestic use is projected 40 million bushels lower as export demand makes sorghum less competitive in ethanol production and for domestic feeding.  The sorghum season-average farm price range is projected 5 cents lower on each end to $2.95 to $3.55 per bushel.  The 2014/15 season-average farm prices for barley and oats are raised based on prices reported to date and the tighter supply situation projected for both this month.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 3.0 million tons higher with a small reduction in beginning stocks more than offset by a 3.2-million-ton increase in world production.  Global corn production is raised 3.2 million tons with increases for EU and the United States partly offset by reductions for FSU.  EU corn production is raised 2.7 million tons with increases in a number of countries based on the latest data and harvest results.  Corn production is lowered 1.0 million tons for Ukraine and 0.5 million tons each for Belarus and Russia, also on the latest harvest results, which reflect the impact of hot, dry, late summer growing conditions.  Global barley production is higher with increases for EU and FSU offsetting a reduction for Australia.  EU mixed grain increases add to world coarse grain supplies.  Foreign sorghum and millet production are lowered with reductions for India and several Sub-Saharan Africa countries.  Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised slightly, mostly due to increased corn use in the United States.  Corn feed use is also increased for Egypt and Iran with higher imports this month.  Sorghum feed use is raised for China, also with higher imports.  Global sorghum consumption, however, declines with lower production and food use for Sub-Saharan Africa and lower U.S. domestic use.  Barley consumption is raised with higher feed use in China and EU.  Global corn trade is lowered this month, mostly reflecting a 3.0-million-ton reduction in expected imports by EU.  Exports are lowered for Canada and Russia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected 0.7 million tons higher with larger stocks in the United States.RICE:  U.S. all rice production in 2014/15 is forecast at 220.7 million cwt, up 2.4 million from last month with the increase entirely due to higher yield.  The average all rice yield is forecast at 7,584 pounds per acre, up 83 pounds from last month.  Yields are raised in Arkansas, Missouri, and Texas.  All rice harvested area is unchanged at 2.91 million acres.  Both long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain rice production are raised from last month, with long-grain production projected at 160.0 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production at 60.7 million.  The all rice import forecast is unchanged at 21.0 million cwt.  Total use is projected at 233.0 million cwt, unchanged from last month with domestic and residual use at 131.0 million and exports at 102.0 million.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 40.5 million cwt, up 2.4 million from last month, and the largest stocks since 2011/12.The 2014/15 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $12.20 to $13.20 per cwt, down 30 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.70 to $18.70 per cwt, up 45 cents per cwt on each end of the range. The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $13.80 to $14.80 per cwt, down 10 cents per cwt on each end of the range. Global rice 2014/15 ending stocks are reduced as the decline in total supplies exceed the fall in total use.  The drop in global 2014/15 rice production resulted in a decline in total supplies, despite an increase in beginning stocks.  Beginning stocks are increased 0.5 million tons due mostly to increases in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  World 2014/15 rice production is projected at 475.5 million tons, down 1.5 million from last month, and a decrease of 1.1 million tons from last year\u2019s record crop.  The fall in production is due mostly to a 1.0-million-ton decrease in India\u2019s crop to 102.0 million tons, due to a decline in average yield.  Below normal seasonal rains during the 2014 monsoon season in some regions of India were unfavorable for rice production.  Rice crops are also reduced in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and several Sub-Saharan African countries.  Global consumption is reduced slightly, but is still a record at 481.7 million tons, up 5.6 million tons from 2013/14.  Global trade for 2014/15 is nearly unchanged from a month ago.  Global 2014/15 ending stocks are projected at 104.2 million tons, down 0.9 million from last month, and 6.2 million below 2013/14.  The decline in world ending stocks is due mostly to a decrease in India of 1.0 million tons.  Forecast ending stocks are also lowered for Pakistan and Sri Lanka, partially offset by increases for Brazil, the Philippines, and the United States.",
    "February_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for lower imports, production, food, seed, and industrial use (FSI), feed and residual use, and stocks. Corn production is estimated at 14.420 billion bushels, down 206 million on reduction in yield to 176.4 bushels per acre. Harvested area is down fractionally. Total corn use is down 165 million bushels to 14.865 billion. FSI use is lowered 40 million bushels, reflecting reductions to corn used for ethanol and other industrial use. For ethanol, the reduction is based on the most recent data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report and weekly ethanol production data as reported by the Energy Information Administration for the months of December and January. Other FSI use is lowered 15 million bushels with lower projections for high fructose corn syrup and glucose and dextrose. Feed and residual use is lowered 125 million bushels to 5.375 billion based on a smaller crop and indicated disappearance during September-November as reflected by the December 1 stocks. With supply falling more than use, corn stocks are lowered 46 million bushels. The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at a midpoint of $3.60 per bushel. Sorghum production for 2018/19 is estimated slightly higher at 365 million bushels, as an increase in yield to 72.1 bushels per acre more than offsets a decline in harvested area. Grain sorghum prices are forecast at $3.35 per bushel, down 5 cents at the midpoint. Global coarse grain production for 2018/19 is forecast 1.5 million tons lower to 1,372.1 million. This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for increased production and consumption, and marginally lower trade. Foreign corn production is forecast higher with increases for Argentina, China, and Ukraine more than offsetting reductions for South Africa and Mexico. Argentina\u2019s corn production is up based on higher expected area and yield, with abundant rainfall and benign temperatures over the past two months boosting yield prospects.  China and Ukraine are higher based on the latest official statistics. South Africa is lowered as heat and dryness during the month of January, particularly in the western producing areas, reduces yield prospects. Major global trade changes for 2018/19 include increased corn exports for Argentina and Ukraine, partially offset by reductions for South Africa and Mexico. For 2017/18, Argentina\u2019s exports are reduced with a partially offsetting increase for Brazil based on observed shipments to date for the local marketing years that both started in March 2018. Imports are raised for South Africa for the marketing years that both started in May 2018.  For 2018/19, imports are raised for Chile but lowered for Venezuela. China\u2019s barley imports are reduced, while barley exports are lowered for Australia. Foreign corn ending stocks are higher, mostly reflecting increases for Argentina and China. Global corn stocks, at 309.8 million, are up 1.0 million.    RICE:  This month\u2019s outlook for 2018/19 U.S. rice is for larger supplies, higher use, and increased ending stocks.  2018/19 all rice production is 224.2 million cwt, up nearly 6 million cwt from the previous estimate and up 26 percent from last year with long-grain accounting for most of the increase.  The all rice average yield is estimated at 7,692 pounds per acre, up 170 pounds from the prior estimate and the second highest on record.  Long-grain production is raised to 164.0 million cwt and medium- and short-grain production is raised to 60.3 million.  All rice domestic and residual usage is increased by 2.0 million cwt to 135.0 million on higher-than-expected usage for August-November as implied by the NASS Rice Stocks report.  Projected U.S. all rice exports are increased by 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million, with the increase for long-grain on reduced competition expected from Brazil with a smaller crop.  Projected 2018/19 all rice ending stocks are increased 2.9 million cwt to 47.1, up 60 percent from last year.  The projected 2018/19 all rice season-average farm price range is unchanged at $11.60 to $12.60 per cwt.  Global 2018/19 rice supplies are increased by 5.1 million tons to 657.9 million, mostly on higher production for China.  Based on National Bureau of Statistics data, China\u2019s 2018/19 rice production is raised nearly 5 million tons to 148.5 million and is virtually unchanged from last year.  World 2018/19 consumption is increased 0.7 million tons to 490.3 million on higher expected use in China, Nepal, and the Philippines more than offsetting reduced use in Brazil and Nigeria.  Global 2018/19 trade is lowered marginally to 47.7 million tons as reduced exports by Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma are not completely offset by higher Chinese exports.  Because of greater supplies and competitive export prices, China\u2019s exports are raised to the highest level since 2002/03.  Nevertheless, China remains the largest global rice importer at 4.5 million tons.  World ending stocks are projected to increase to a record-large 167.6 million tons, led by China, which accounts for 69 percent of global stocks. ",
    "May_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2016/17 are projected up 4 percent from the 2015/16 record with increases in both beginning stocks and production.  Corn production for 2016/17 is projected at 14.4 billion bushels, up 829 million from 2015/16 and 214 million higher than the previous record in 2014/15.  A 5.6-million-acre increase in corn plantings more than offsets a small reduction in yield.  The U.S. corn yield is projected at 168.0 bushels per acre, down 0.4 bushels from 2015/16.  Corn supplies for 2016/17 are projected at a record 16.3 billion bushels, up 886 million from 2015/16, which more than offsets projected declines for sorghum, barley, and oats.U.S. corn use for 2016/17 is projected at a record 14.1 billion bushels, 4 percent higher than for 2015/16.  Feed and residual use for 2016/17 is projected 300 million bushels higher with higher production, lower expected prices, and further expansion in animal numbers in 2016/17.  Corn used to produce ethanol is projected 50 million bushels higher than in 2015/16 with a reduction in sorghum use for ethanol and higher expected ethanol blending.  Exports for 2016/17 are projected 175 million bushels higher than this month\u2019s upwardly revised projection for 2015/16.  More competitive prices and reduced supplies and competition from Brazil support gains in U.S. exports for 2016/17 and 2015/16.  U.S. corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 2.2 billion bushels, up 350 million from the 2015/16 projection.  If realized, stocks would be the highest since the mid-1980s; however, the stocks-to-use ratio remains far lower than in those years when domestic support policies ballooned stocks to more than 50 percent of annual usage.  The season-average 2016/17 farm price is projected at $3.05 to $3.65 per bushel, down 25 cents at the midpoint from this month\u2019s slightly higher outlook for 2015/16.Global coarse grain supplies for 2016/17 are projected at a record 1,543.2 million tons, up 41.0 million tons from 2015/16 with nearly half of the increase on larger U.S. beginning stocks and production.  Global corn production for 2016/17 is projected at 1,011.1 million tons, up 42.2 million from 2015/16, and just short of the record 1,013.5 million in 2014/15.  In addition to the projected 21.1-million-ton U.S. increase, 2016/17 corn production is also higher for most of the world\u2019s major producing countries with production rebounds for South Africa and EU, and higher area in Argentina, Russia, and Ukraine.  Brazil corn production for 2016/17 is 1.0 million tons higher than this month\u2019s lowered outlook for 2015/16 as area is expected to decline slightly, but yields rise from those now expected for the 2015/16 crop.  Partly offsetting these increases for 2016/17 is a 6.6-million-ton reduction for China corn, as changes in support policies and lower domestic prices reduce incentives for corn planting.Global corn consumption for 2016/17 is projected at a record 1,011.9 million tons, 43.0 million tons higher than in 2015/16.  The largest increases are for China with consumption projected up 9.5 million tons and the United States with consumption projected up 9.2 million tons.  Smaller increases are projected for EU, Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia, Vietnam, Mexico, and South Korea.  Global corn exports for 2016/17 are higher with increases for Argentina, EU, and Ukraine more than offsetting a reduction for Brazil.  Corn imports for 2016/17 are lower with declines for South Africa, EU, Vietnam, and China partly offset by increases for Mexico, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, and South Korea.  Much of the imbalance in global marketing year imports and exports is driven by the timing of Brazil and Argentina exports and the South Africa change from a net importer to a net exporter.  The 2016/17 local marketing years for these Southern Hemisphere exporting countries do not start until 2017, while the local marketing years for many major importers begin in October 2016.  Corn shipments by Southern Hemisphere exporters between October 2015 and February 2016 were strong, appearing as 2014/15 exports, but accounted for as 2015/16 imports.  Reduced 2015/16 Brazil second-crop corn limits export prospects between October 2016 and February 2017.  As a result, global imports decline in 2016/17 at the same time that U.S. exports expand.  Global 2016/17 corn ending stocks are projected at 207.0 million tons, down slightly from the 207.9 million for 2015/16.  Lower stocks in China, EU, and Brazil more than offset the projected U.S. increase.RICE:  U.S. 2016/17 all rice production is forecast at 231.0 million cwt, up 38.7 million cwt from the previous year and the largest since 2010/11.  The increase reflects larger area and a higher yield.  Long-grain harvested area is forecast at 2.4 million acres, up 32 percent from the previous year and the largest in six years.  Combined medium- and short-grain harvested area is forecast at 0.6 million acres, down 17 percent from 2015/16 due to a sharp reduction in southern medium-grain planted area.  The yield increase for both classes of rice reflects a return to trend.  Total U.S. 2016/17 all rice supplies are forecast to increase 13 percent from the previous year.  Long grain supplies are up, while medium- and short-grain supplies are down.  U.S. 2016/17 total use is projected at 248.0 million cwt, up 12 percent from the previous year with both domestic and residual use and exports projected higher.  Long-grain exports for 2016/17 are forecast at 81.0 million cwt, up 12 million from the previous year and the largest in more than a decade.  Combined medium- and short-grain exports are forecast at 32.0 million cwt, up 1.0 million cwt from 2015/16.  Despite increased domestic use and exports, 2016/17 all rice ending stocks are forecast to rise 7.0 million cwt to 50.4 million.  Long-grain stocks are forecast at 38.0 million cwt, up 15.5 million cwt from the previous year and the largest since 1985/86.  Combined medium- and short-grain ending stocks are forecast down 8.5 million cwt to 10.5 million.  The 2016/17 all rice season-average price is forecast at $11.30 to $12.30 per cwt; down $0.60 at the midpoint the previous year.  Global 2016/17 rice production is forecast at a record 480.7 million tons and total supply at 587.1 million tons, up 2.3 million from the previous year.  Total global rice consumption is forecast at 480.5 million tons, up 2.1 million tons from the previous year\u2019s revised level and a record.  Reductions in historical domestic use estimates are made for several countries, most importantly for China and Thailand, that led to lower global domestic use and increased ending stocks.  World exports are forecast at 40.7 million tons, down 0.7 million tons from 2015/16 and the second consecutive decline.  Thailand and India show the largest year-over-year export reductions.  Global ending stocks of 106.7 million tons are up fractionally from 2015/16.  ",
    "August_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2015/16 U.S. feed grain supplies are increased this month with higher forecast corn, sorghum, barley, and oats production.  Corn production is forecast at 13.7 billion bushels, up 156 million from the July projection, with the season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast at 168.8 bushels per acre, 2.0 bushels higher than last month\u2019s trend-based projection.  Corn supplies for 2015/16 are projected at a record 15.5 billion bushels, up 154 million from last month with a small reduction in beginning stocks.  Projected ending stocks for 2014/15 decline 6 million bushels with higher expected use.  Increased use for sweeteners is partly offset by reductions in other categories of food and industrial use and an increase in imports.Total U.S. corn use for 2015/16 is projected 40 million bushels higher as increased domestic usage is expected to more than offset a reduction in exports.  Feed and residual use is projected 25 million bushels higher with the larger crop and lower expected prices.  Food, seed, and industrial use is projected up 40 million bushels with use for ethanol production raised 25 million bushels on the latest forecast for gasoline consumption by the Energy Information Administration.  Exports are projected 25 million bushels lower with larger supplies in Brazil and Argentina expected to increase competition for U.S. corn in world markets.  U.S. corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected 114 million bushels higher.  The season-average corn price received by producers is projected 10 cents lower on both ends to $3.35 to $3.95 per bushel.  This would be down 5 cents, at the midpoint, from the $3.65 to $3.75 per bushel expected for 2014/15.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected 4.8 million tons higher with a 3.0-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 1.8-million-ton increase in global coarse grain production.  Foreign corn beginning stocks are up 3.6 million tons with increases in 2014/15 production for Brazil and Mexico and increases in 2014/15 imports for China, EU, South Korea, and Mexico.  Argentina corn production is also raised for 2014/15.  Foreign corn production for 2015/16 is reduced 5.5 million tons with reductions for China, EU, and Serbia, only partly offset by increases for Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia.  Global barley production is higher this month with increases for Ukraine and Morocco outweighing a reduction for Canada. Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is lowered slightly with a reduction in global corn use driven by reductions in corn feeding for EU, China, and Ukraine.  Higher wheat feeding is expected for EU and Ukraine, and higher sorghum feeding for China.  Global coarse grain trade is higher with corn imports raised for EU, barley imports raised for Saudi Arabia, and sorghum imports raised for China.  Corn exports are raised for Ukraine, Brazil, and Russia with larger crops.  Corn exports are reduced for Serbia, EU, and the United States.  Barley exports are raised for Ukraine, but lowered for Canada.  Sorghum exports are raised for the United States with the larger crop.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised this month with a 5.1-million-ton increase for corn mostly on higher stocks in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 total rice supplies are projected at 278.4 million cwt, nearly unchanged from last month.  Lower production more than offsets larger carryin stocks and imports.  The first survey-based forecast of the U.S. 2015/16 rice crop is 205.0 million cwt, down 2.0 million from last month and 7 percent below the previous year.  Average all rice yield is forecast at 7,472 pounds per acre, down 72 pounds per acre from last month\u2019s projection, and 1 percent below last year.  Area harvested is unchanged at 2.74 million acres.  Long-grain production is forecast at 149.0 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production at 56.0 million.  The all rice import projection is 25.5 million cwt, up 0.5 million from last month\u2014with the increase in long-grain.U.S. 2015/16 total rice use is projected at 236.0 million cwt, 4.0 million below last month, but 3 percent above the previous year.  Total domestic and residual use is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 129.0 million due mostly to a smaller crop and a lower residual component.  Exports are forecast at 107.0 million cwt, down 3.0 million from last month, and 6 percent above last year.  The decrease is due to reduced supplies and strong competition with Southeast Asian exporters.  Long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain exports are projected at 74.0 million and 33.0 million, respectively.  U.S. all rice ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 42.4 million cwt, up 4.0 million from last month, but 11 percent below the previous year.The 2015/16 U.S. long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $11.50 to $12.50 per cwt, up 60 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.  Combined medium- and short-grain price is projected at $17.80 to $18.80 per cwt, unchanged from a month ago.  The California and Other States medium- and short-grain prices are unchanged from a month ago at a midpoint of $21.00 per cwt and $14.80 per cwt, respectively.  The 2015/16 all rice price is projected at $13.40 to $14.40 per cwt, up 40 cents per cwt on each end of the range.The projected decrease in global 2015/16 total use of rice is greater than the drop in total supply resulting in an increase in world ending stocks.  Global rice production is lowered 1.7 million tons to 478.7 million, still a record, due primarily to forecast reductions for Argentina, Cambodia, Iraq, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States.  Thailand\u2019s 2015/16 rice crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 18.0 million, attributed mostly to an abnormally low rainfall in important growing areas, including the Central Region.  Planted area has been lowered by 3 percent due to restrictions on irrigation water availability imposed by the government of Thailand because of low reservoir levels.  Global beginning stocks for 2015/16 are increased 1.1 million tons due mostly to a 1.0-million-ton increase in Thailand.  Thailand\u2019s 2014/15 exports are reduced by 1.0 million tons to 9.0 million due to the slow pace of sales.  World 2015/16 consumption is reduced 1.0 million tons to 487.8 million, still a record.  Consumption is lowered in Bangladesh, India, and the United States.  Global trade is lowered 0.4 million tons due mostly to a reduction in exports from Cambodia and the United States.  Global 2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 90.8 million tons, up 0.3 million from last month.",
    "December_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for lower exports and greater ending stocks.  Exports are lowered 75 million bushels as competition from other exporters and relatively high U.S. prices have resulted in slow sales and shipments through early December.  With no other use changes, corn ending stocks are raised 75 million bushels.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $6.70 per bushel based on observed prices to date. For 2022/23 sorghum, a substantial decline in demand from China supports greater domestic use expectations.  Exports are lowered 20 million bushels, with offsetting increases to food, seed, and industrial and feed and residual use. Global coarse grain production for 2022/23 is forecast down 5.9 million tons to 1,453.6 million.  The 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, greater trade, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is reduced with forecast declines for Ukraine, Russia, the EU, and Vietnam.  Ukraine corn production is sharply lower with reductions to both area and yield as the ongoing conflict and record-setting autumn rainfall have delayed the harvest in key producing oblasts of Poltava, Sumy, and Cherkasy.  Russia corn production is lowered as harvest delays in the country reduce area expectations.  Barley production is raised for Australia based on the most recent crop report from ABARES.  Argentina barley production is cut on continued dry conditions.Corn exports are raised for Ukraine but lowered for the United States, Russia, and the EU.  Barley exports are raised for Australia but lowered for Argentina.  For 2021/22, sorghum exports for Argentina are lowered for the local marketing year beginning March 2022, based on shipments through the month of November.  For 2022/23, corn imports are raised for the EU, but lowered for Canada, Iran, South Korea, Mexico, Vietnam, Philippines, and Turkey.  Sorghum imports are reduced for China.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down, reflecting reductions for Ukraine, Paraguay, Vietnam, and Mexico.  Global corn stocks, at 298.4 million tons, are down 2.4 million.RICE:  The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice is for unchanged supplies and domestic use, lower exports, and higher stocks compared with last month.  The export forecast is reduced 2.0 million cwt to 69.0 million, all long-grain, based on a slow pace of shipments and sales and would be the lowest level since 1991/92.  Rough rice exports are reduced 2.0 million cwt to 23.0 million, which would be the lowest level since 2000/01.  Ending stocks are forecast 2.0 million cwt higher to 38.1 million. The 2022/23 season average farm price (SAFP) forecasts for all medium- and short-grain rice and all-rice were both lowered as the proportion of California rice for 2022/23 is expected to be smaller.  The medium- and short-grain SAFP forecast is lowered $0.90 per cwt to $29.10 and the all-rice SAFP forecast is lowered $0.90 per cwt to $19.00.  The SAFP for long-grain rice is unchanged at $16.50 per cwt.  The 2022/23 global outlook has slightly lower supplies, less consumption, increased trade, and slightly reduced ending stocks compared with last month.  Supplies are lowered 1.2 million tons to 685.6 million, primarily on lower beginning stocks for Vietnam and Thailand and reduced production in Australia and the EU.  The global consumption forecast declines 0.9 million tons to 516.9 million, primarily on a reduction for India.  Trade is forecast 0.9 million tons larger to 53.7 million tons, mainly on increased exports for India, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Global 2022/23 ending stocks are reduced by 0.4 million tons to 168.6 million, the lowest since 2017/18.",
    "March_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2012/13 U.S. corn ending stocks are unchanged this month as an increase in imports and lower exports support higher expected feed and residual disappearance.  Corn imports are raised 25 million bushels reflecting the strong pace of shipments reported through January.  Corn exports are lowered 75 million bushels based on the slow pace of sales and shipments to date and stronger expected competition from South American corn and from competitively priced feed quality wheat.  Feed and residual disappearance for corn is raised an offsetting 100 million bushels with continued expansion in poultry production and a 10-million-bushel reduction in projected sorghum feed and residual use.  Sorghum exports are projected 10 million bushels higher based on the strong pace of sales and shipments.  Smaller trade changes are projected for barley and oats based on shipments to date.The projected season-average farm prices for corn and sorghum are each lowered 20 cents on the high end of the range to $6.75 to $7.45 per bushel and $6.70 to $7.40 per bushel, respectively.  The projected farm price ranges for barley and oats are narrowed 10 cents on each end to $6.25 to $6.55 per bushel and $3.70 to $3.90 per bushel, respectively. Global coarse grain supplies for 2012/13 are projected 1.0 million tons lower with a 0.8-million-ton decrease in production.  Corn production is lowered 0.5 million tons for Argentina reflecting extended dryness in February that reduced yield prospects, particularly for late-planted corn.  South Africa corn production is reduced 0.5 million tons as dryness and heat reduce yield prospects in the western areas of the maize belt.  Sorghum production is lowered 0.5 million tons for Australia as excessively high temperatures have reduced harvested area as indicated by the latest government estimates and yield prospects as confirmed by satellite imagery.  India corn production is raised 0.4 million tons as planting progress reports for the winter crop indicate a year-to-year increase in area.  Global coarse grain exports for 2012/13 are lowered this month mostly reflecting the projected reduction in U.S. corn exports.  World corn feed and residual use is raised with higher expected use in the United States.  Corn feed use is also raised for India and Malaysia.  Corn imports and feeding are lowered for South Korea with higher expected imports of feed quality wheat and increased wheat feeding.  Sorghum imports and feeding are raised for Mexico with the increase in U.S. sorghum exports.  Global coarse grain ending stocks decline 0.6 million tons with small reductions in corn stocks for Brazil, Malaysia, Argentina, and India.RICE:  The changes made to the U.S. 2012/13 rice supply and use balances this month are confined to the trade categories and ending stocks.  The 2012/13 all-rice import forecast is raised 0.5 million cwt to 21.5 million, based largely on the pace of imports reflected in the U.S. Bureau of the Census import data through January\u2014all in long-grain rice.  On the use side, the all-rice export forecast is increased 2.0 million cwt to 108.0 million\u2014all in long-grain rice.  The rough rice and milled export (rough-equivalent basis) forecasts are each raised 1.0 million cwt to 35.0 million and 73.0 million, respectively.  Increased export commitments to Iran and Western Hemisphere markets support the increase in the 2012/13 export projection.  Export commitments for 2012/13 through the end of February are up 19 percent from a year ago according to the latest USDA\u2019s U.S. Export Sales report.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 29.1 million cwt, down 1.5 million from a month ago\u2014all in long-grain rice.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 16.4 million cwt, the lowest stocks since 2003/04.  Medium-/short-grain ending stocks are unchanged at 10.5 million cwt. The 2012/13 long-grain, season-average price is raised 20 cents per cwt at the midpoint to $14.50, the medium/short grain price is lowered 30 cents per cwt at the midpoint to $15.90, and the all rice season-average price is unchanged at $14.90 per cwt at the midpoint.Global 2012/13 rice production, consumption, trade, and ending stocks are all up from a month ago.  World rice production is forecast at a record 468.1 million tons, up 2.3 million from last month, largely due to increases for Cambodia and India.  India\u2019s rice crop is projected at 102.0 million tons, up 2.0 million from last month, but down 4.3 million from record 2011/12.  The increase in India\u2019 s crop is due entirely to the larger Kharif rice crop now forecast by the government of India at 90.7 million tons, up 4.5 million from an earlier forecast.  The Rabi rice crop is expected to be down from last year due to late planting and a lower expected average yield.  World consumption is forecast at a record 470.2 million tons, up 0.9 million from last month, owing mostly to increases for Cambodia, India, and Peru.  The increase in global trade is relatively small.  Global 2012/13 ending stocks are projected at 103.3 million tons, up 1.4 million from a month ago, but down 2.2 million from last year.",
    "August_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2014/15 U.S. feed grain supplies are raised this month with higher production forecasts for corn, sorghum, barley, and oats.  Corn production for 2014/15 is forecast 172 million bushels higher at a record 14,032 million bushels.  The first survey-based corn yield forecast, at a record 167.4 bushels per acre, is up 2.1 bushels from last month\u2019s trend-based projection.  Sorghum production is forecast 19 million bushels higher with the forecast yield 3.0 bushels per acre higher than last month\u2019s projection.  Small yield increases also boost barley and oats production slightly.Corn supplies for 2014/15 are projected at a record 15,243 million bushels with the increase in production partly offset by a 65-million-bushel reduction in beginning stocks.  Corn use for ethanol and exports are raised 45 million bushels and 20 million bushels, respectively, for 2013/14, based on reported data to date.  Projected corn use for 2014/15 is higher with use for ethanol and exports each raised 25 million bushels, and feed and residual disappearance 50 million bushels higher with the larger crop.  Projected ending stocks for 2014/15 are raised slightly to 1,808 million bushels.  The projected season-average farm price for corn is lowered 10 cents at both ends of the range to $3.55 to $4.25 per bushel. Sorghum supplies for 2014/15 are projected 4 million bushels higher as a 15-million-bushel increase in 2013/14 exports lowers 2014/15 beginning stocks, mostly offsetting the higher forecast production.  Projected sorghum exports for 2014/15 are raised 10 million bushels.  The season-average farm price for sorghum is also projected 10 cents lower at both ends of the range to $3.30 to $4.00 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 4.9 million tons higher, mostly reflecting larger expected corn crops in the United States and EU and increased barley production for FSU-12.  The smaller projected carryin for the United States partly offsets this month\u2019s 6.6-million-ton increase in global coarse grain output.  EU corn production is raised 1.4 million tons after abundant rainfall and favorable temperatures during July.  FSU-12 barley production is raised 3.1 million tons with a 2.0-million-ton increase for Russia and smaller increases for Belarus and Ukraine.  Barley production is also raised 0.3 million tons for EU.  Reduced prospects for corn, sorghum, and millet, with the delayed monsoon, lower India total coarse grain production 2.7 million tons, partly offsetting increases elsewhere.  Turkey corn production is also lowered 0.3 million tons.Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is raised this month with a 2.3-million-ton increase in world corn use.  Higher corn use in the United States accounts for most of the increase.  Corn consumption is lowered 2.0 million tons for EU as heavy summer rains have reduced wheat quality across the region, raising prospects for wheat feeding.  Corn food use is reduced 0.5 million tons for India with the smaller crop outlook.  Higher projected corn use for Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Algeria, and Taiwan partly offset these reductions.  Corn imports are lowered for EU, but raised for Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Lebanon, and Algeria.  Global barley trade is raised with higher imports for Turkey and higher exports for Russia and Ukraine.  Global 2014/15 coarse grain ending stocks are projected 2.7 million tons higher reflecting larger barley ending stocks.  Global corn ending stocks are lowered slightly.RICE:  U.S. 2014/15 total rice supplies are projected at 282.6 million cwt, up 2.8 million from last month on higher production.  USDA's first survey-based forecast of the U.S. 2014/15 rice crop is 228.8 million cwt, up nearly 21 percent from the previous year.

The 2014/15 all rice price is projected at $13.80 to $14.80 per cwt, up 30 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.The projected decrease in global 2014/15 total supply is greater than the drop in total use resulting in a decrease in world ending stocks.  Global production is lowered 2.1 million tons to 477.3 million, still a record, due primarily to forecast reductions for Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia, and India, offset partially by an increase in the United States.  India\u2019s 2014/15 rice crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 103.0 million, attributed mostly to a slower rate of planting of the kharif rice crop due to the late start of the monsoon and below normal precipitation in some rice growing areas.  Global beginning stocks for 2014/15 are lowered 1.4 million tons due mostly to a 1.3-million-ton reduction for Indonesia\u2014where the 2013/14 crop is lowered to 36.0 million tons.  World 2014/15 consumption is reduced 0.3 million tons to 482.1 million, still a record.  Global trade is lowered 0.3 million tons due mostly to a reduction in exports from India, partially offset by an increase in the United States.  Global 2014/15 ending stocks are projected at 105.4 million tons, down 3.2 million from last month, and a decline of 4.7 million from the previous year.  The largest stocks reductions from a month ago are in Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia, and India.",
    "May_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  The U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2017/18 is for lower production, domestic use, exports and ending stocks. The corn crop is projected at 14.1 billion bushels, down from last year\u2019s record high with a lower forecast area and yield. The yield projection of 170.7 bushels per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer weather, estimated using the 1988-2016 time period. The yield model includes a downward stochastic adjustment to account for the asymmetric response of yield to July precipitation. The smaller corn crop is partly offset by the largest projected beginning stocks since 1988/89, leaving total corn supplies down from a year ago but still the second highest on record. Total U.S. corn use in 2017/18 is forecast to decline 2 percent from a year ago as a slight increase in domestic use is more than offset by lower exports.  Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is projected to rise 80 million bushels to 7.0 billion due to increased use of corn to produce ethanol for fuel and expected growth in non-ethanol FSI.  Corn used to produce ethanol is up 50 million bushels, reflecting expectations of gasoline consumption growth, reduced sorghum used to produce ethanol, higher expected blending and continued global ethanol import demand.  Projected feed and residual use declines as a smaller crop and increased use of ethanol by-products more than offsets growth in grain consuming animal units.  U.S. corn exports are down 350 million bushels, as a 1.0-billion-bushel year-over-year increase in the combined corn exports of Brazil and Argentina during 2016/17 (local marketing years beginning in March 2017 and ending February 2018) is expected to cut into the 2017/18 U.S. shipping season.  With total supply falling faster than use, 2017/18 U.S. ending stocks of corn are down 185 million bushels. The season-average farm price is projected at $3.00 to $3.80 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint from 2016/17.The global coarse grain outlook for 2017/18 is for lower production, increased use and sharply reduced ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast down from a year ago, with the largest declines in China and the United States.  Partly offsetting are larger crops projected for the EU and Canada. Global corn use is up 9 million tons (1 percent), while global corn imports are projected to increase 7 million tons.  Notable increases in corn imports include Vietnam, Egypt, the EU, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Iran.  Global corn ending stocks are down from last year\u2019s record high and if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14.  The drop largely reflects forecast declines for China and the United States. For China, total corn supply is down 14 million tons in 2017/18, based on projected declines in beginning stocks and production.  Area is reduced based on planting intentions published by the National Bureau of Statistics.  On the demand side, feed and residual use is expected to increase based on continued relatively low internal market prices, efforts by the government to promote use of domestic supplies and reduced imports of corn substitutes.  Projected FSI use is higher based on expectations of growth in domestic use and exports of corn-based industrial products. RICE: U.S. 2017/18 all rice production is forecast at 201.0 million cwt, down 23.1 million from the previous year, all on a large reduction in long grain acreage as indicated by the NASS Prospective Plantings survey issued March 31.  The forecast 2017/18 yields are based on long-term historical trends and are higher for long grain but slightly lower for combined medium- and short-grain.  Total 2017/18 rice supplies are forecast to decrease 7 percent from the previous year to 273.1 million cwt, primarily on the reduction in long grain.   U.S. 2017/18 total use is projected at 235.0 million cwt, down 4 percent from last year with both domestic and residual use and exports projected lower.  Long-grain exports are projected at 76.0 million cwt, down 3.0 million from 2016/17 on reduced exportable supplies.  Combined medium- and short-grain exports are projected at 34.0 million cwt, down 1 million on increased export competition from Australia and Egypt.  All rice 2017/18 ending stocks are projected at 38.1 million cwt, down 21 percent from last year.  Long-grain stocks are projected at 20.7 million cwt, down 8 million from 2016/17, while combined medium- and short-grain are projected 2 million cwt lower at 14.6 million.  The 2017/18 all rice season-average farm price is projected at $10.70 to $11.70/cwt, up $0.80 from the previous year\u2019s revised midpoint. Total 2017/18 global supplies are at 599.9 million tons, up 2.6 million from 2016/17, based on larger carry-in stocks.  World 2017/18 rice production is projected at 481.3 million tons, down fractionally from last year\u2019s record output.  Total world rice consumption is projected at a record 480.1 million tons, up from the revised 2016/17 level of 478.7 million.  Global exports are projected at 42.2 million tons, up 0.8 million from 2016/17.  Thailand and India are expected to be the leading rice exporters for 2017/18, both at 10.0 million tons.  World 2017/18 ending stocks are projected at 119.8 million tons, up marginally from 2016/17.  China continues to hold the majority of global rice stocks as its growing production and large imports continue to outpace consumption.  ",
    "February_2018": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for increased exports and reduced stocks.  Exports are raised 125 million bushels, reflecting U.S. price competitiveness and reduced exports for Argentina and Ukraine.  With no other use changes, U.S. corn ending stocks are lowered 125 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is projected at $3.30 per bushel, up 5 cents at the midpoint.  The U.S. sorghum supply, use, and midpoint price forecasts are unchanged relative to last month. Global coarse grain production for 2017/18 is projected 2.3 million tons lower to 1,321.9 million.  This month\u2019s foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, greater consumption, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Global corn production is lowered 2.8 million tons largely reflecting reductions for Argentina and Ukraine.  For Argentina, persistent heat and dryness during January and early February reduced yield prospects for early-planted corn in key central growing areas.  Production is lowered for Ukraine based on the latest official statistics.  Small increases for Moldova, Mexico, Bangladesh, and Thailand are partly offsetting. Barley production is raised for Argentina.  Mexico sorghum production is increased.  Major global trade changes for 2017/18 include higher projected corn exports for the United States and Brazil, with reductions for Argentina and Ukraine.  Corn imports are raised for Turkey, the EU, and Brazil.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for Argentina and Ukraine that more than offset increases for Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey.  Global corn ending stocks, at 203.1 million tons, are down 3.5 million from last month.RICE: The U.S. 2017/18 rice supply and demand estimates are unchanged this month.  The projected season-average farm price for all rice is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint of the range.  The reduction is primarily attributed to lower-than-expected long-grain prices reported by NASS.Global 2017/18 rice supplies are lowered 1.3 million tons on reduced beginning stocks and lower production.  Total world production is only down fractionally primarily on a smaller Bangladesh crop.  Exports are up 1.0 million tons to a record 46.8 million.  Export changes are led by a 0.5-million-ton increase for India and a 0.3-million-ton increase for Burma.  Imports are raised 0.8 million tons for Bangladesh and 0.5 million for Indonesia.  Total global use is raised 0.6 million tons for 2016/17 but reduced 1.0 million for 2017/18.  For the 2017/18 marketing year, consumption is lowered 0.2 million tons each for Bangladesh, Burma, and India, while it is raised 0.3 million for China.  Ending stocks are down 0.3 million tons but remain the highest since 2000/01.",
    "April_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected higher this month as an increase in ending year corn stocks more than offset reductions for sorghum, barley, and oats.  Corn feed and residual disappearance is lowered 150 million bushels reflecting indicated disappearance for the first half (September-February) of the marketing year.   The reduction in corn feed and residual use is partly offset by a combined 20-million-bushel increase in projected feed and residual use for the other feed grains based on the March 1 stocks.  Adding to 2012/13 feed grain supplies this month are increases of 3 million bushels and 2 million bushels, respectively, in projected barley and sorghum imports.Domestic corn use for 2012/13 is projected 100 million bushels lower as a 50-million-bushel increase in corn used to produce ethanol partly offsets the lower projection for feed and residual disappearance.  Larger-than-expected March 1 corn supplies, lower corn prices, and favorable margins for producing and blending ethanol limit the expected year-to-year decline in ethanol production during the second half of the marketing year (March-August).  Corn exports for 2012/13 are projected 25 million bushels lower reflecting the continued sluggish pace of sales and shipments and additional competition from Brazil and Ukraine.  Projected U.S. corn ending stocks for 2012/13 are raised 125 million bushels.The projected ranges for the season-average corn and sorghum farm prices are lowered 20 cents at their midpoints to $6.65 to $7.15 per bushel and $6.60 to $7.10 per bushel, respectively.  The projected farm price ranges for barley and oats are narrowed 5 cents on each end to $6.30 to $6.50 per bushel and $3.75 to $3.85 per bushel, respectively. Global coarse grain supplies for 2012/13 are projected higher with a 1.1-million-ton increase in world coarse grain production.  Higher world corn production is partly offset by reductions in China sorghum and Algeria barley output.  Corn production is raised 1.5 million tons for Brazil as continued favorable growing season weather boosts prospects for production to a record 74.0 million tons.  EU-27 corn production is raised 1.4 million tons with upward revisions to production in Spain, Hungary, and Poland.  Corn production is also increased 0.2 million tons for Russia on the final government estimate.  Partly offsetting these increases are reductions in corn output for South Africa, Vietnam, and Serbia.  South Africa production is lowered 0.5 million tons as more heat and dryness in March further trim yield prospects in the western and west central parts of the growing belt.Global coarse grain trade for 2012/13 is raised slightly as a small reduction in world corn exports are more than offset by increases for EU-27 barley and India sorghum.  Corn exports are lowered 0.6 million tons for the United States and 0.5 million tons for South Africa, but exports are raised 0.5 million tons each for Brazil and Ukraine.  Global corn feed and residual use is down 5.3 million tons with much of the decline reflecting the reduction in the United States.  Feed and residual use is also lowered for China, Egypt, Mexico, and Serbia.  A 1.5-million-ton increase in EU-27 corn feed and residual use is partly offsetting.  Global corn stocks are raised 7.8 million tons with 3.2-million-ton increases for both the United States and China, and a 0.9-million-ton increase for Brazil.RICE:  Higher-than-previously expected March 1 U.S. rice stocks, as reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) on March 28, results in a 5.0- million-cwt reduction in all rice 2012/13  domestic and residual use, and a commensurate increase in ending stocks.  No changes are made on the 2012/13 supply side or to projected exports.  Long-grain 2012/13 domestic and residual use is lowered 4.0 million, and medium- and short-grain domestic use is lowered 1.0 million. The all rice 2012/13 export projection is unchanged at 108.0 million cwt.NASS estimated March 1 all rice rough stocks at 104.3 million cwt and milled rice stocks at 6.7 million cwt (9.5 million on a rough-equivalent basis). The March 1 all rice stocks estimate on a rough-equivalent basis at 113.8 million cwt is up 0.8 percent from a year earlier, and up 0.9 percent from the preceding 5-year average.  The decrease in 2012/13 domestic and residual use led to a 5.0 million cwt or 17 percent increase in all rice ending stocks to 34.1 million cwt.  Long-grain ending stocks are raised 4.0 million cwt to 20.4 million, and medium- and short-grain stocks increased 1.0 million to 11.5 million.The projected U.S. average milling yield for 2012/13 is reduced to 70 percent, down 0.25 percentage points from last month.  The change is based on data supplied by the Rice Millers\u2019 Association of the USA Rice Federation for August through January and on expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.The midpoint of the 2012/13 long-grain, medium- and short-grain, and all rice season-average prices are unchanged at $14.50 per cwt, $15.90 per cwt, and $14.90 per cwt, respectively.World rice production is reduced 0.5 million tons to 467.6 million tons, still a record, largely due to lower projections for Colombia, Pakistan, and Thailand, which are partially offset by increased projections for Ecuador,  Indonesia, and the Philippines.  Global consumption is reduced 0.9 million tons, largely due to reductions for Burma, Brazil, Pakistan, the Philippines, South  Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States.  Trade projections for 2012/13 are little changed from a month ago.  Global 2012/13 ending stocks at 103.8 million tons are up 0.5 million from last month, but down 1.7 million from the prior year.",
    "May_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected to slightly exceed the record level of 2014/15 as larger beginning stocks more than offset lower expected production.  Corn production is projected at 13.6 billion bushels, down 586 million from the record 2014/15 crop with a lower forecast area and yield.  The U.S. corn yield is projected at 166.8 bushels per acre, down 4.2 bushels from the 2014/15 record based on a weather adjusted yield trend that assumes normal summer weather.  The 2015 yield outlook is not raised, despite the rapid pace of late-April and early-May planting, as more than 90 percent of the variability in the corn yield is determined by July precipitation and temperatures in the Midwest, which are unknowable at this time.  Corn supplies for 2015/16 are projected at a record 15.5 billion bushels, up just slightly from 2014/15.U.S. corn use for 2015/16 is projected at a record 13.8 billion bushels, 1 percent higher than this month\u2019s revised projection for 2014/15.  Feed and residual use for 2015/16 is projected 50 million bushels higher with animal numbers up from 2014/15.  Corn used to produce ethanol in 2015/16 is expected to be unchanged as projected gasoline consumption during the 2015/16 marketing year is nearly identical to 2014/15.  Corn use in other food, seed, and industrial categories in 2015/16 is projected slightly higher than this month\u2019s lower forecast for 2014/15.  Exports for 2015/16 are projected 75 million bushels higher on the year with the 2014/15 projection raised 25 million bushels this month.  More competitive prices and growth in world demand support gains in U.S. exports for 2015/16, but large foreign supplies limit growth in the U.S. share of global trade.  Corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1.7 billion bushels, down 105 million from the 2014/15 projection.  The season-average 2015/16 farm price is projected at $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel, down 15 cents at the midpoint from this month\u2019s lowered outlook for 2014/15.  Available opportunities for forward pricing the 2015 crop have been at substantially lower levels than the pre-planting bids offered for the 2014 crop.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected at a record 1,505.1 million tons, up 9.6 million tons from 2014/15 with the increase mainly reflecting larger corn beginning stocks and production for China.  Global corn production for 2015/16 is projected at 989.8 million tons, down from the 2014/15 record, largely reflecting the smaller projected U.S. crop.  Declines in 2015/16 corn production are also expected for EU, Brazil, Ukraine, and Mexico.  In addition to China, where corn production is projected up 12.3 million tons, corn production is expected higher for South Africa, India, Canada, Russia, and Argentina.  Global corn consumption for 2015/16 is projected at a record 990.4 million tons, 13.0 million tons higher than in 2014/15, with notable increases for China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Canada, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Mexico.  Corn imports for 2015/16 are projected higher year-to-year for EU, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Korea, and Mexico.  Corn exports are lowered for Ukraine, Brazil, and EU, but raised for South Africa, Argentina, and India compared with 2014/15.  Global corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 191.9 million tons, down 0.6 million from 2014/15.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 all rice supplies are forecast up 3 percent from 2014/15 and total use is up 2 percent.  This will lead to an 11 percent increase in 2015/16 ending stocks projected at 47.4 million cwt. Beginning stocks for 2015/16 are forecast at 42.9 million cwt.  Projected 2015/16 imports at a record 24.5 million cwt.  U.S. rice production for 2015/16 is projected at 219.0 million cwt.  Long-grain production is projected at 162.0 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain production at 57.0 million.  All rice harvested area is estimated at 2.90 million acres.  Long-grain harvested area is 2.19 million acres.  Combined medium- and short-grain harvested area is 0.71 million acres.  The drought-induced drop in California medium- and short-grain area has attracted more acres of medium-grain rice in the Delta where plantings in 2015 are projected up 3 percent.  U.S. all rice average yield is projected at 7,562 pounds per acre, nearly the same as last year.U.S. 2015/16 all rice total use is projected at 239.0 million cwt with domestic and residual use at 131.0 million and exports at 108.0 million.  Long-grain rice exports are projected at 76.0 million cwt, and medium- and short-grain rice exports at 32.0 million.  U.S. all rice ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 47.4 million cwt with long-grain ending stocks at 34.1 million cwt, and medium- and short-grain rice stocks at 11.0 million.The U.S. 2015/16 long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $10.00 to $11.00 per cwt, compared to a revised $11.80 to $12.20 for the previous year.  The medium- and short-grain price is projected at $17.80 to $18.80 per cwt, compared to a revised $17.80 to $18.20 for the year earlier.  The 2015/16 all rice price is projected at $12.30 to $13.30 per cwt, compared to a revised $13.20 to $13.60 per cwt for 2014/15.  The California medium- and short-grain price is expected to strengthen slightly, and the Other States price is unchanged from 2014/15.Global 2015/16 total rice ending stocks are expected to drop 6.9 million tons to 91.5 million tons with a stocks-to-use ratio of 18.7 percent, the lowest since 2006/07.  World rice production is projected at a record 482.1 million tons.  Global consumption is projected at a record 489.0 million tons.  Global exports in 2015/16 are projected at 42.4 million tons.  Exports in 2015/16 will be down from the previous year for India and Pakistan, but up for Burma, Cambodia, and the United States.  Thailand\u2019s exports are unchanged at 11.0 million tons.  Larger 2015/16 imports are projected for China and the Middle East.  Global 2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 91.5 million tons, the lowest stocks since 2007/08.  The global stocks-to-use ratio at 18.7 percent is the lowest since 2006/07.  The largest year-to-year stocks reductions occur in India, Thailand, Indonesia, and China.",
    "August_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2016/17 U.S. feed grain supplies are increased this month with higher forecast corn, sorghum, barley, and oats production.  Corn production is forecast at a record 15.2 billion bushels, up 613 million from the July projection.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 175.1 bushels per acre, is up 7.1 bushels from last month\u2019s trend-based projection and above the record 171.0 bushels in 2014/15.  The Crop Production report indicates that nearly all Corn Belt states, with the exception of Minnesota and South Dakota, are forecast to have yields above a year ago.  Sorghum production is forecast 55 million bushels higher with the forecast yield 8.4 bushels per acre above last month\u2019s projection.  U.S. corn supplies for 2016/17 are projected at a record 16.9 billion bushels, up 1.5 billion from the prior year with the larger crop and small increases in beginning stocks and imports.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised 5 million bushels reflecting a larger import projection and offsetting usage changes.   Imports are raised as the pace of organic corn imports through June has been above expectations.  Corn use for ethanol production in 2015/16 is lowered 25 million bushels, based on the latest indications from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report.  An offsetting 25-million-bushel increase is made to corn exports supported by the recent robust pace of shipments and sales. Total U.S. corn use for 2016/17 is projected 300 million bushels higher at a record 14.5 billion.  Feed and residual use is raised 175 million bushels with the larger crop and lower expected prices.  Exports are projected 125 million bushels higher, reflecting the relative competitiveness of U.S. corn on the world market and large new-crop outstanding sales.  Corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected 328 million bushels higher and, if realized, would be the highest since 1987/88.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 25 cents on both ends to $2.85 to $3.45 per bushel.  This would be down 45 cents at the midpoint from the $3.55 to $3.65 per bushel range now expected for 2015/16. The all barley price is raised this month based on early indications of prices received by farmers for malting barley.Foreign coarse grain supplies for 2016/17 are projected 5.1 million tons higher this month with a 2.3-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 3.0-million-ton increase in production.  Foreign corn carryin is up, mostly reflecting lower 2015/16 corn feeding in Indonesia, Canada, and Ukraine as 2015/16 corn production increases for the EU and South Africa offset a further reduction for Brazil.  Foreign corn production for 2016/17 is raised 2.1 million tons with increases for Argentina, India, and Mexico more than offsetting reductions for the EU and Canada.  Corn area is raised in Argentina on an expected reduction in planted area for wheat and small grains.  For India, corn area is increased as favorable rainfall has boosted plantings to date as reported in the latest government statistics.  Abundant summer rainfall in Mexico boosts corn yield prospects, but persistent dryness in Ontario reduces the outlook for production in Canada.  EU corn production is lowered mostly on reductions for Spain and France. Global coarse grain consumption for 2016/17 is raised 8.9 million tons this month with higher corn use in the United States accounting for half of the increase.  Outside the United States, corn feeding is raised for Mexico, India, and the EU.  Partly offsetting is a 1.0-million-ton reduction in corn feeding for Indonesia, where government import licensing policy is expected to reduce corn imports.  Global coarse grain trade is raised reflecting increases for corn and to a lesser extent barley.  Global 2016/17 coarse grain ending stocks are projected 13.4 million tons higher reflecting larger corn and barley stocks.  Global corn stocks are projected 12.4 million tons higher with the United States accounting for two-thirds of the increase.  RICE:  Total U.S. rice supplies for 2016/17 are lowered 2.2 million cwt from last month to 307.7 million, still the highest on record.  Carryin is lowered 1.5 million cwt to 39.4 million due to 2015/16 revisions.  The 2016/17 U.S. rice production forecast is lowered 0.7 million cwt to a record 244.3 million based on the first survey-based yield forecast of the 2016/17 crop.  At 7,659 pounds per acre, the 2016/17 yield is down 21 pounds from the previous projection.  With no revisions to the use side of the 2016/17 rice balance sheet, the lower supply forecast reduces the 2016/17 U.S. ending stocks 2.2 million cwt to 54.7 million, still the highest since 1985/86.  For 2015/16, total U.S. exports are raised 1.5 million cwt to 104.5 million, with long-grain accounting for all of the increase.  The only price revision for 2015/16 is a 20-cent reduction in the season-average farm price for California medium- and short-grain rice to $18.00 per cwt.  For 2016/17, the U.S. long-grain price is lowered 50 cents on both the high and low ends of the range to $9.50 to $10.50 per cwt.  The California 2016/17 medium- and short-grain price is lowered $1.00 on both ends to $14.50 to $15.50 per cwt.  The other states medium- and short-grain 2016/17 price is lowered 50 cents on both ends to $10.00 to $11.00 per cwt.The 2016/17 global production forecast is lowered fractionally to 481.1 million tons (milled basis), still the highest on record.  Crop forecasts for 2016/17 are lowered for Afghanistan and Bolivia but raised for Iran.  For 2015/16, the Indonesia crop estimate is increased, while Vietnam is lowered.   Global consumption for 2016/17 is lowered 1.8 million tons to 478.8 million, mostly due to a reduction for India.  The 2016/17 global export forecast is raised slightly to 40.6 million tons, with stronger shipments from India offsetting weaker exports from Vietnam.  The 2016/17 global ending stocks forecast is increased 6.5 million tons to 113.8 million, 2 percent above the previous year\u2019s revised estimate.  India accounts for most of the upward revision in the global ending stocks forecasts for both 2015/16 and 2016/17.",
    "December_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn supply and use outlook is unchanged from last month.  The projected season-average farm price remains at $5.45 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2021/22 is forecast 2.7 million tons higher to 1,501.7 million.  The foreign coarse grain outlook is for greater production, increased trade, and larger ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher as increases for the EU and Ukraine more than offset a reduction for China.  EU corn production is raised reflecting increases for France, Romania, and Poland.  Ukraine corn production is higher based on harvest results to date.  China corn production is reduced reflecting the latest information published by the National Bureau of Statistics which indicated higher area that was more than offset by a reduction in yield.  Barley production is raised for Australia but lowered for the EU and Iran.  Sorghum production is increased for Australia. Corn exports are raised for Ukraine and the EU.  Imports are raised for Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, but lowered for Israel.  For 2020/21, corn exports for Brazil are raised for the local marketing year beginning March 2021, based on higher-than-expected shipments through the month of November.  Sorghum exports for 2021/22 are raised for Australia, with higher imports projected for China.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised, mostly reflecting increases for Ukraine, the EU, Mexico, and Iran that are partly offset by a reduction for China. RICE:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice is for reduced supplies, unchanged domestic use, slightly lower exports, and fractionally lower ending stocks compared with last month.  The import forecast is reduced 1.5 million cwt to 33.5 million, based on a slow pace of shipments through October and expectations of continued high freight costs and limited container availability the rest of 2021/22.  In addition, the export forecast is reduced by 1.0 million cwt to 89.0 million, all for medium- and short-grain rice, based on shipment pace and outstanding sales to-date.  U.S. exports are limited by high prices and smaller U.S. supplies.  Milled rice exports are reduced 2.0 million cwt to 55.0 million, which would be the lowest milled rice exports since 1973/74.  Ending stocks are forecast fractionally lower to 34.5 million cwt.  The season-average farm price forecast for all rice is unchanged this month at $14.80 per cwt, as an increase to the long-grain price forecast offsets a decrease in the medium- and short-grain price.The 2021/22 global outlook is for lower supplies, lower consumption, fractionally larger trade, and slightly reduced ending stocks compared with last month.  Supplies are lowered 1.5 million tons to 697.7 million for 2021/22, mostly on smaller crop forecasts for Bangladesh, Thailand, and Peru.  The global trade forecast is fractionally larger at 49.7 million tons, primarily due to an increase in exports for Burma.  Global 2021/22 ending stocks are reduced 1.1 million tons to 186.8 million.",
    "December_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn supply and use outlook is unchanged from last month.  The projected season-average farm price is unchanged at $4.00 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2020/21 is forecast virtually unchanged at 1,447.8 million tons.  The 2020/21 foreign coarse grain outlook is for essentially unchanged production, greater trade, and smaller ending stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast lower as an increase for Ukraine is more than offset by reductions for Argentina, the EU, and Canada.  Argentina corn production is reduced based on lower expected area.  Canada corn output is lowered as marginally higher area is more than offset by a reduction in yield.  EU corn production is down mostly reflecting a smaller forecast for Bulgaria.  Ukraine corn production is raised based on harvest results to date.  Barley production is raised for Australia and Canada.  Sorghum production is increased for Argentina. Corn exports are raised for Ukraine but lowered for the EU.  Imports are raised for China and Bangladesh, with partially offsetting reductions for the EU, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, and Tunisia.  China\u2019s sorghum and barley imports are projected higher, raising the country\u2019s total coarse grain imports 4.8 million tons to 30.9 million.  If realized, this would be record high and account for 14 percent of global coarse grain trade, slightly below the high seen during 2014/15.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020/21 are reduced, mostly reflecting reductions for India, Brazil, Canada, Ukraine, and Egypt.RICE:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for slightly lower supplies, unchanged domestic use, decreased exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered, all on reduced medium- and short-grain imports.  Imports are lowered by 0.8 million cwt to 36.5 million as reduced shipments from China to Puerto Rico are expected.  Exports are lowered by 2.0 million cwt to 95.0 million on the continued weak pace of sales and shipments in the first half of the marketing year (MY) with all the reduction for long-grain.  Projected 2020/21 all rice ending stocks are raised 1.3 million cwt to 50.8 million, up 77 percent from last year.  These would be the largest ending stocks since the 1986/87 MY.  The projected 2020/21 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per cwt to $13.10 with increases in both the long-grain and medium- and short-grain prices.  These increases are based on NASS prices reported through October and price expectations for the remainder of the MY.The 2020/21 global outlook is for slightly higher supplies, larger consumption, increased trade, and reduced stocks.  Rice supplies are raised 0.4 million tons to 679.4 million, primarily on increased beginning stocks for Pakistan and higher production for Australia.  World production for 2020/21 is raised 0.1 million tons as higher production for Australia and Peru is nearly offset by a reduction for South Korea.  Global 2020/21 consumption is increased 1.2 million tons to 500.4 million, led by greater consumption for Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.  World trade is raised by 1.0 million tons to 45.3 million tons, primarily on increased exports by India as its shipment pace since August remains robust.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 0.8 million tons to 179.0 million but are still record high with China and India accounting for 65 and 17 percent, respectively.",
    "August_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for lower supplies, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and a decline in ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.2 billion bushels, down 102 million from the July projection.  The season\u2019s first survey-based corn yield forecast, at 169.5 bushels per acre, is 1.2 bushels lower than last month\u2019s trend-based projection.  This month\u2019s Crop Production report indicates that South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois are forecast to have yields below a year ago.  The projected yield for Indiana is unchanged relative to last year, while Nebraska and Ohio are forecast higher.  Sorghum production is forecast 13 million bushels higher with the forecast yield 2.6 bushels per acre above last month\u2019s projection.  Projected feed and residual use for 2017/18 is lowered 25 million bushels on a smaller crop.  Exports are forecast down 25 million bushels, reflecting the increased competitiveness of supplies in Argentina and Brazil and the low level of new-crop outstanding sales.  With supplies falling faster than use, ending stocks are reduced 52 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $2.90 to $3.70 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for virtually unchanged production, lower trade, and greater stocks relative to last month.  EU corn and barley production are reduced.  Canada corn production is down on lower projected harvested area.  Corn and barley production forecasts are raised for Russia based on higher corn area and favorable growing conditions for barley.  Ukraine corn production is unchanged as a reduction in projected yield is offset by increased area.  For 2016/17, corn production is increased for Brazil based on second crop corn harvest results to date. Major global corn grain trade changes for 2017/18 include corn export reductions for the EU, Serbia, and Canada.  More than offsetting are increases for Ukraine and Russia.  Brazil\u2019s corn exports are raised for 2016/17 based on record-high shipments observed for the local marketing year beginning in March 2017.  Corn imports for 2017/18 are raised, mostly reflecting increases for the EU and Iran.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month.  Historical revisions are made to corn stock estimates for Ukraine to better reflect statistics published by the government.RICE:  Total U.S. rice supplies are lowered 5.0 million cwt from last month due to a smaller crop and a slight reduction in beginning stocks.  The 2017/18 U.S. rice production forecast is lowered 4.8 million cwt to 186.5 million based on the first survey-based yield forecast of the 2017/18 season.  Long-grain production is lowered nearly 4.0 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production is down almost 0.9 million cwt.  This is the smallest all rice crop since 2011/12.  At 7,513 pounds per acre, the 2017/18 yield is down 194 pounds from the previous projection.  Partly offsetting the reduction in supplies is a 2.5 million cwt reduction in domestic and residual use.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 2.5 million cwt to 30.0 million, the lowest in a decade.  The 2017/18 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.40 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $12.20 to $13.20.  Prices for all rice classes are raised this month.  The 2017/18 global supplies are lowered fractionally with decreased production more than offsetting higher beginning stocks.  This remains the second largest global crop on record.  Foreign production is lowered 0.9 million tons on reductions for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  Global consumption for 2017/18 is lowered 0.6 million tons with the largest reduction for Bangladesh.  Global exports are raised 0.5 million tons primarily on India.  The 2017/18 global ending stocks are raised 0.4 million tons to 122.9 million.  ",
    "May_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected at a record 403.3 million tons, up 2 percent from 2013/14 mostly on larger corn beginning stocks.  Corn production is projected at 13.9 billion bushels, up slightly from the 2013/14 record with higher expected yields more than offsetting the year-to-year reduction in planted area.  The corn yield is projected at 165.3 bushels per acre, up 6.5 bushels from 2013/14, based on a weather adjusted yield trend model and assuming normal mid-May planting progress and summer weather.  (See Westcott and Jewison, Weather Effects on Expected Corn and Soybean Yields, USDA-ERS, July 2013, www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fds-feed-outlook/fds-13g-01.aspx.)  Corn supplies for 2014/15 are projected at a record 15.1 billion bushels, up 330 million from 2013/14.U.S. corn use for 2014/15 is projected 2 percent lower than in 2013/14.  Feed and residual use is projected 50 million bushels lower with animal numbers down from 2013/14.  Exports are projected 200 million bushels lower than this month\u2019s higher projection for 2013/14 as larger expected foreign supplies and lower import demand limit U.S. shipments.  Corn used to produce ethanol in 2014/15 is expected to be unchanged on the year with gasoline consumption expected to remain flat in 2015.  Corn ending stocks are projected at 1.7 billion bushels, up 580 million from the 2013/14 projection.  With the larger carryout, the season-average farm price is projected at $3.85 to $4.55 per bushel, down from $4.50 to $4.80 per bushel for 2013/14.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected at a record 1,461.0 million tons, up 2 percent from 2013/14 as the year-to-year increase in world beginning stocks more than offsets a reduction in world output.  Projected global corn production for 2014/15, at a record 979.1 million tons, is virtually unchanged from 2013/14.  Expected decreases for Ukraine, Brazil, India, and South Africa are mostly offset by increases for China, Argentina, Russia, and Mexico.  Ukraine production is lowered 4.9 million tons from last year\u2019s record level as the reduced value of the local currency keeps input prices high and reduces expected use of fertilizer and other inputs.  Global sorghum and millet production are projected higher for 2014/15, but reductions are expected for barley, oats, rye, and mixed grains.  Global corn trade for 2014/15 is projected lower with imports projected down year to year for China and Mexico.  Corn exports for 2014/15 are projected lower for Ukraine and the United States.  Exports, however, are projected higher for Argentina and Paraguay.  World corn consumption is projected at a record 965.8 million tons, up 17.0 million from 2013/14 on higher use in China, Brazil, the European Union, Mexico, and Japan.  Global corn ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 181.7 million tons, up 13.3 million tons on the year and at a 15-year high.RICE:  U.S. 2014/15 all rice supplies are forecast up 6 percent from 2013/14, and total use is up 5 percent\u2014leading to a 17 percent increase in 2014/15 ending stocks.  Beginning stocks for 2014/15 are forecast at 29.3 million cwt, down 20 percent from the previous year.  Projected 2014/15 imports at 22.0 million cwt are unchanged from 2013/14.  U.S. rice production for 2014/15 is projected at 213.0 million cwt, up 12 percent from 2013/14.  Long-grain production is projected at 161.0 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain production at 52.0 million.  Harvested all rice area is estimated at 2.85 million acres.  Long-grain harvested area at 2.21 million acres is up 25 percent from the previous year.  Combined medium- and short-grain harvested area at 0.65 million acres is down 8 percent from 2013/14.  The decline in California medium-grain plantings due to drought and water restrictions have attracted more acres of medium-grain rice in the Delta where plantings in 2014 are projected up 39 percent.  All rice average yield is projected at 7,468 pounds per acre, down 3 percent from the previous year\u2019s record\u2014based on trend analysis by rice class.U.S. 2014/15 all rice total use is projected at 230.0 million cwt with domestic and residual use at 128.0 million, and exports at 102.0 million.  Long-grain rice exports are projected at 72.0 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain rice exports at 30.0 million.  Larger long-grain supplies in 2014/15 and lower projected prices are expected to expand exports, but competition for markets is expected to be strong.  Exports of medium-grain rice will be constrained by tighter U.S. supplies because of reduced plantings in California.  U.S. all rice ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 34.3 million cwt, with long-grain ending stocks at 24.3 million cwt, and combined medium- and short-grain rice stocks at 7.7 million.The U.S. 2014/15 long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $13.50 to $14.50 per cwt, compared to a revised $15.20 to $15.80 for the previous year.  The combined medium- and short-grain price is projected at $18.50 to $19.50 per cwt, compared to a revised $17.70 to $18.30 for the year earlier.  The 2014/15 all rice price is projected at $15.00 to $16.00 per cwt, compared to a revised $15.80 to $16.40 per cwt for 2013/14.Global 2014/15 total rice supply and use are each projected to reach record levels at 592.0 and 482.2 million tons, respectively, and results in a 1.5-million decrease in world ending stocks.  Global 2014/15 rice production is projected at a record 480.7 million tons, up 4.6 million from 2013/14.  Record to near-record rice crops are projected in Asia\u2014assuming normal weather.  Record crops are projected for the major exporters including India, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Additionally, large crops are forecast for other exporters including Burma, Cambodia, and Egypt.  On the importer side, record or near-record crops are forecast for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Global 2014/15 consumption is projected at a record 482.2 million tons, up 1.5 percent from the previous year.  Global exports in 2014/15 are projected at a record 41.4 million tons, up 1.0 million from 2013/14.  Thailand is forecast to be the largest global rice exporter in 2014/15 with exports of 10.0 million tons followed by India at 9.0 million and Vietnam at 6.7 million.  Large 2014/15 imports are projected for China, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  China\u2019s imports have surged since 2011/12 and are forecast to be the largest importer with imports of 3.7 million tons in 2014/15.  China\u2019s annual consumption needs have overtaken production since 2012/13 resulting in declining stocks.  Strong domestic prices in China have encouraged imports of lower-priced rice from Burma, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  Global 2014/15 ending stocks are expected to decrease 1.5 million tons to 109.8 million.  The largest year-to-year stocks reductions occur in India and China\u2014down 1.0 million tons and 0.65 million, respectively.",
    "January_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. 2012/13 feed grain supplies are increased slightly with higher corn production more than offsetting a reduction for sorghum.  Harvested area for corn is lowered 346,000 acres, but a 1.1-bushel-per-acre increase in the estimated yield boosts production 55 million bushels.  Sorghum harvested area is nearly unchanged, but a 1.3-bushel-per-acre decrease in the estimated yield lowers production 9 million bushels.Projected corn use for 2012/13 is raised with higher expected feed and residual disappearance more than offsetting reduced prospects for exports.  Feed and residual use is projected 300 million bushels higher based on September-November disappearance as indicated by December 1 stocks and on higher expected beef, pork, and poultry production.  Corn exports are projected 200 million bushels lower reflecting the slow pace of sales and shipments to date and increasing pressure from larger supplies and exports for South America.  Corn ending stocks are projected 44 million bushels lower at 602 million.  The season-average farm price for corn is unchanged at $6.80 to $8.00 per bushel.  While stiff competition has limited U.S. corn exports, higher domestic disappearance leaves the balance sheet historically tight and is expected to support continued strong and volatile prices well into summer, particularly in the domestic cash markets.Other 2012/13 feed grain changes this month include increases in projected sorghum, barley, and oats feed and residual disappearance as indicated by the December 1 stocks.  Sorghum exports are projected 35 million bushels lower with feed and residual use projected up 50 million bushels.  Oats exports are lowered 1 million bushels, based on the pace of sales and shipments to date.  The season-average sorghum farm price is raised 20 cents at the midpoint to $6.70 to $7.90 per bushel.  The barley farm price is projected down 5 cents at the midpoint to $6.10 to $6.70 per bushel on lower reported prices for malting barley.  The projected oats farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on each end of the range to $3.60 to $4.00 per bushel.Global coarse grain supplies for 2012/13 are projected 2.9 million tons higher mostly reflecting the larger U.S. corn crop and increased corn production for South America.  Paraguay corn production is raised 1.1 million tons on a higher projected yield, which is in line with historical yield and production revisions this month.  Brazil corn production is raised 1.0 million tons on higher expected yields with favorable December rainfall across the southern growing areas.  Argentina corn production is raised 0.5 million tons as lower harvested area is more than offset by higher expected yields.  Heavy rains and flooding in November and December delayed planting and reduced area prospects.  Since then, clearing weather, the absence of threatening heat, and abundant soil moisture have set the stage for strong year-to-year yield increases, particularly in the central growing region.  Partly offsetting these increases are reductions in corn output of 0.5 million tons for Russia and 0.1 million tons each for the Philippines and Serbia.  Changes for Russia and Serbia reflect the latest government estimates.  The smaller expected crop in the Philippines is based on the latest assessment of typhoon damage in December.   Changes to 2012/13 global coarse grain exports, in the aggregate, are small this month, but increases in 2011/12 and 2012/13 local year corn exports for South American countries have substantial implications for U.S. corn exports during the 2012/13 September-August marketing year.  Exports for Argentina are raised 0.5 million tons for 2011/12 and 1.0 million tons for 2012/13.  Exports for Brazil are raised 0.5 million tons for 2011/12 and 1.5 million tons for 2012/13.  With the local marketing years in both of these Southern Hemisphere countries running from March through February, increases in both years weigh against U.S. export prospects for 2012/13.  Similarly, in Paraguay, where the local marketing year runs from January through December, corn exports are boosted 0.6 million tons and 0.5 million tons, respectively, for 2011/12 and 2012/13, also reducing prospects for U.S. corn exports during the current marketing year.  EU-27 corn exports are also raised 0.5 million tons for 2012/13.Global corn consumption for 2012/13 is raised 5.6 million tons mostly on the increase in U.S. corn feeding this month.  Consumption is raised slightly for Paraguay, but lowered slightly for Russia and Serbia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected 1.6 million tons lower with lower expected stocks in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.  Stocks are raised for Paraguay with the larger projected crop.RICE:  The U.S. 2012/13 rice crop is estimated at 199.5 million cwt, up 0.9 million from the previous estimate.  Average yield is estimated at a record 7,449 pounds per acre, up 32 pounds per acre from last month, and an increase of 382 pounds per acre from 2011/12.  Harvested area is estimated at 2.678 million acres, up 1,000 acres from the previous estimate.  Long-grain rice production is estimated at 144.2 million cwt, up 4.3 million from last month, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 3.4 million to 55.3 million.  Rice imports for 2012/13 are unchanged from last month. The National Agricultural Statistics Service\u2019s (NASS) Rice Stocks reported total rough rice stocks at 147.6 million cwt as of December 1 and total milled stocks at 6.9 million (9.8 million cwt on a rough-equivalent basis).  Total rice stocks on a rough-equivalent basis are 157.4 million, up 1 percent from a year earlier.  Long-grain stocks as of December 1 are estimated at 96.7 million (rough-equivalent basis) and combined medium- and short-grain stocks at 51.4 million.  Rice 2012/13 domestic and residual use is unchanged at 125.0 million cwt.  Long-grain domestic and residual use is projected at 94.0 million, up 1.0 million from a month ago.  Combined medium- and short-grain domestic use is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 31.0 million.  The all rice export projection is raised 1.0 million cwt to 106.0 million, all in the long-grain class, up 4 percent from the preceding year.  The pace of exports and sales of long-grain rice have been brisk based on Census data through October and U.S. Export Sales data through early January.  Long-grain exports have been particularly strong to Western Hemisphere markets including Colombia, Central America, Haiti, and Venezuela.  The 2012/13 rough rice export projection is unchanged at 34.0 million cwt, but up 4 percent from the prior year.  Exports of milled rice are increased by 1.0 million cwt to 72.0 million, up 4.5 percent from 2011/12.  All rice ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected at 30.1 million cwt, nearly unchanged from last month, but a decrease of 27 percent from a year ago.  Long-grain rice ending stocks are forecast at 17.4 million cwt, up 2.3 million from last month, but a decrease of 28 percent from 2011/12.  Combined medium- and short-grain rice ending stocks are projected at 10.5 million cwt, down 2.4 million from last month, and a decline of 29 percent from last year. The 2012/13 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $13.70 to $14.70 per cwt, unchanged from last month, and the combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $16.00 to $17.00 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $14.40 to $15.40 per cwt, down 10 cents per cwt on both ends of the range. World 2012/13 rice total supplies are virtually unchanged as a slight increase in production is more than offset by a reduction in beginning stocks.  Global beginning stocks for 2012/13 are forecast down nearly 200,000 tons due mostly to reductions for Japan and Thailand that are partially offset by increases for China, and Pakistan.  Global rice production is projected at a record 465.6 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month due primarily to higher forecasts for Argentina, Brazil, and Pakistan partially offset by a decrease for Cambodia.  Brazil\u2019s 2012/13 rice crop is raised 340,000 tons to 8.16 million tons, due mostly to an increase in average yield, based on the latest government report from Brazil.  Brazil\u2019s average rice yield has been trending higher in recent years as farmers are utilizing a larger share of higher yielding varieties and fully irrigating a larger share of the crop.  Global consumption for 2012/13 is forecast at a record 468.6 million tons due mostly to increases in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Global 2012/13 trade is raised 1.1 million tons to 37.7 million, down 1.3 million from the record in 2011/12.  Export projections are raised for Argentina, Brazil, India, the United States, and Vietnam and lowered for Pakistan.  Import forecasts for 2012/13 are raised for Sub-Saharan Africa.  World ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected at 102.5 million tons, nearly unchanged from last month, and a decrease of 3.0 million from the prior year.  Ending stocks are lowered for India, Thailand, and Vietnam, but raised for Brazil, Nigeria, and Pakistan.",
    "July_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2013/14 U.S. feed grain supplies are lowered this month with reduced beginning stocks for corn and sorghum and lower forecast harvested areas for corn and sorghum from the Acreage report.  Corn beginning stocks for 2013/14 are projected 40 million bushels lower.  Corn production for 2013/14 is lowered 55 million bushels with the lower harvested area and the projected yield unchanged at 156.5 bushels per acre.  Projected production remains just below 14 billion bushels and would be 858 million above the record in 2009/10.  Corn supplies for 2013/14 are lowered 90 million bushels as a 5-million-bushel increase in imports only partly offsets the lower beginning stocks and production.This month\u2019s changes to corn use for 2012/13 and 2013/14 largely reflect the lateness of the 2013 crop and expectations for extremely tight supplies later this summer and into early fall.  Feed and residual disappearance for 2012/13 is raised 50 million bushels as early harvest of new-crop corn is expected to be sharply reduced from last year.  A 10-million-bushel increase in projected imports for 2012/13 also reflects the tight supply situation expected for old-crop corn during the summer quarter.  Imports for 2013/14 are raised because the tight supply situation is expected to continue into September.  Feed and residual use for 2013/14 is lowered 50 million bushels with tighter beginning stocks and lower production, and also on the lack of early new-crop usage which tends to boost indicated disappearance during the September-December quarter of the new marketing year.  Projected exports for 2013/14 are lowered 50 million bushels as tight supplies of corn in early September are expected to limit early season shipments.  With lower projected use in 2013/14, ending stocks are raised 10 million bushels and remain just under 2 billion bushels.  The projected 2013/14 season-average farm price for corn is unchanged at $4.40 to $5.20 per bushel.  The 2013/14 other feed grain farm price projections are also unchanged.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 3.6 million tons lower with 2.9 million tons of the decline resulting from the tighter supply situation for corn and sorghum in the United States.  Foreign coarse grain supply and use changes this month are relatively small in the aggregate.  Corn beginning stocks for 2013/14 are lowered for Brazil with higher 2012/13 exports and for Indonesia with lower 2012/13 production.  China corn production for 2013/14 is lowered 1.0 million tons on lower indicated area.  European Union corn production is increased 1.8 million tons when adjusted for this month\u2019s inclusion of Croatia, however, last month\u2019s 27-member union is lowered 0.4 million tons.  Barley production is raised 0.5 million tons for Canada and 0.2 million tons for Kazakhstan, both on higher reported area.  European Union barley production is raised 0.5 million tons with the addition of Croatia accounting for less than half the increase.Global 2013/14 coarse grain trade is mostly unchanged this month with exports down slightly on the reduction for U.S. corn.  Global corn consumption is down 2.6 million tons with half of the reduction in the United States.  Corn consumption is also lowered for Indonesia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 151.0 million tons, down 0.9 million, with reductions for Brazil and China.  World corn stocks are expected to be the highest since 2001/02.RICE:  U.S. all rice supplies in 2013/14 are lowered 10.5 million cwt or 4 percent to 235.6 million cwt, the lowest since 2000/01, as beginning stocks and production are lowered 1.5 million and 10.0 million, respectively.  Conversely, the import forecast is raised 1.0 million cwt to a near-record 23.5 million.  Beginning stocks for 2013/14 are lowered 1.5 million cwt as small changes are made to 2012/13 supply and use ( imports are lowered 0.5 million to 21.0 million, and exports are raised 1.0 million to 109.0 million.  Rice production in 2013/14 is lowered 5 percent to 179.5 million cwt this month due entirely to a 5 percent reduction in harvested area as reported in the Acreage report released on June 28.  Harvested area for 2013/14 is dropped 141,000 acres to 2.45 million, down almost 9 percent from last year, and the lowest since 1987/88.U.S. all rice total use for 2013/14 is lowered 6.0 million cwt or nearly 3 percent to 207.0 million, the lowest since 2000/01, as domestic and residual use, and exports are each reduced 3.0 million.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 28.6 million cwt, down 4.5 million, or nearly 14 percent from a month ago, and the lowest since 2003/04.The 2013/14 long-grain rice U.S. season-average farm price (SAFP) is projected at $14.50 to $15.50 per cwt, up 60 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain SAFP is projected at $15.80 to $16.80 per cwt, unchanged from a month ago.  The 2013/14 all rice SAFP is projected at $14.90 to $15.90 per cwt, up 40 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.  Long-grain rice price projection for 2013/14 is raised due mostly to a decrease in expected supplies.  Combined medium- and short-grain rice prices are expected to remain near last year\u2019s level as there will be strong competition from Egypt and Australia for export markets outside of Northeast Asia.Global 2013/14 rice production, consumption, trade, and ending stocks are all reduced from last month. Global production is projected at 478.7 million tons, still a record despite decreases totaling 0.5 million mostly due mainly to reductions for the United States and Vietnam.  Global exports in 2013/14 are reduced slightly due mostly to an expected decrease in U.S. and Pakistan, which is partially offset by an increase for China.  Global consumption for 2013/14 is reduced due mostly to decreases for the United States and Nigeria, which are partially offset by increases for Thailand.  World ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 108.0 million tons, down 0.6 million from last month, but 2.6 million above the previous year.  The decline in ending stocks is due mostly to reductions for the United States, Indonesia, and Vietnam, which is partially offset by increases for China, Nigeria, and Thailand.Several significant trade changes are made for 2012/13.  Global 2012/13 exports are reduced by 0.6 million tons with most of the decrease occurring for Thailand and Pakistan \u2014 down 500,000 and 200,000 tons, respectively. This is partially offset by increases in 2012/13 exports for China, Argentina, and the United States.  Imports for 2012/13 are lowered for Indonesia and the Philippines.",
    "June_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  The outlook for 2013/14 U.S. feed grain supplies is lowered this month as delayed plantings reduce yield prospects for corn.  Projected corn production is lowered 135 million bushels to 14.0 billion with the average yield projected at 156.5 bushels per acre, down 1.5 bushels from last month.  Despite rapid planting progress during mid-May across the Corn Belt, rains and cool temperatures since have delayed the completion of planting in parts of the western Corn Belt and raised the likelihood that seasonally warmer temperatures and drier conditions in late July will adversely affect pollination and kernel set in a larger share of this year\u2019s crop.With reduced production prospects, domestic corn usage is projected 70 million bushels lower for 2013/14.  Projected feed and residual disappearance is lowered 125 million bushels with the smaller crop, higher expected prices, and increased availability of distillers\u2019 grains.  Corn used in ethanol production is raised 50 million bushels in line with an increase this month for the 2012/13 marketing year.  Other food and industrial uses are also projected higher, up 5 million bushels from last month.  Corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 55 million bushels lower.  At the projected 1.9 billion bushels, ending stocks are expected to be 2.5 times their 2012/13 level.  The season-average farm price range for corn is raised 10 cents per bushel on each end to $4.40 to $5.20 per bushel.  Increases are also projected for the sorghum, barley, and oats farm price ranges this month.  Changes for 2012/13 include higher corn and oats imports, higher corn food, seed, and industrial use, and reduced corn exports.  Corn imports are raised 25 million bushels based on the strong pace of imports to date and expectations that feeders in some locations will continue to supplement domestic supplies as old-crop corn becomes tighter during the summer months.  Oats imports are raised 3 million bushels reflecting shipments to date.  Corn used in ethanol production is raised 50 million bushels for 2012/13 based, in part, on higher-than-expected May ethanol production as indicated by weekly data reported by the Energy Information Administration.  Favorable margins for ethanol producers and high prices for Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) are also expected to moderate any slowdown in production through the end of the marketing year.  Other food and industrial use is projected up 15 million bushels with increases projected for corn use in cereals and beverage and industrial alcohol.  Corn exports are projected 50 million bushels lower based on the continued lackluster pace of shipments and sales.  Projected corn ending stocks for 2012/13 are raised 10 million bushels. Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 4.3 million tons lower mostly on the reduction expected in U.S. corn output.  Global coarse grain beginning stocks are also lowered as a reduction in 2012/13 China corn production is only partly offset by an increase in 2012/13 Brazil corn production this month.  China corn production is lowered 2.4 million tons based on the latest government revisions for the 2012/13 crop.  Brazil corn production is raised 1.0 million tons for 2012/13 based on higher reported area for the safrina crop which will be harvested in the coming weeks.Global 2013/14 coarse grain trade is raised slightly this month.  Corn imports are raise for Indonesia and corn exports are raised for India.  Global corn consumption is down 1.7 million tons mostly based on changes to domestic use in the United States.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 2.8 million tons lower with reductions for China and the United States partly offset by an increase for Brazil carried through from the larger 2012/13 crop.  At the projected 151.8 million tons, 2013/14 world corn stocks would be up 27.5 million tons from 2012/13 and the largest in 12 years.RICE: The 2013/14 all rice supply and use balance sheet is unchanged from last month.  Small revisions are made to the 2013/14 rice by-class supply and use balance sheets.  Rice by-class 2013/14 beginning stocks forecasts are changed based on small adjustments to 2012/13 rice by-class balance sheets.  Long-grain rice 2013/14 beginning stocks are raised 1.0 million cwt to 21.4 million resulting from a reduction in the 2012/13 export forecast now projected at 76.0 million.  Combined medium- and short-grain 2013/14 beginning stocks are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 10.5 million resulting from an increase in the 2012/13 export forecast now projected at 32.0 million.  Rough rice exports for 2012/13 are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 35.0 million and combined milled and brown rice exports are raised 1.0 million to 73.0 million.  No other changes are made to 2012/13 and 2013/14 U.S. rice supply and use balance sheets except for season-average farm price forecasts.The 2013/14 U.S. long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $13.90 to $14.90 per cwt, up 10 cents per cwt on each end from a month ago and compares to a revised $14.30 to $14.50 per cwt for 2012/13.  The 2013/14 combined medium- and short-grain rice season-average farm price is $15.80 to $16.80 per cwt, an increase of 30 cents per cwt on each end from last month and compares to a revised $16.00 to $16.20 per cwt for 2012/13.  The 2013/14 U.S. all rice season-average farm price is projected at $14.50 to $15.50 per cwt, up 20 cents per cwt on each end from a month ago and compares to a revised $14.80 to $15.00 per cwt for 2012/13.Global 2013/14 rice supply and use is little changed from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at a record 479.2 million tons, down less than 100,000 tons from last month. Global 2013/14 exports are lowered 0.5 million tons to 38.4 million due to a decrease for Thailand.  Thailand\u2019s export forecasts for 2012/13 and 2013/14 are each lowered 0.5 million to 7.5 and 8.0 million, respectively.  Thailand\u2019s 2012/13 export pace has been slow due to uncompetitive prices and expectations that the current situation will continue into the new marketing year which begins in January 2014.  Import forecasts for Nigeria are lowered both for 2012/13 and 2013/14.  The imposition of high import tariffs by Nigeria and an expected larger 2013/14 rice crop will likely slow the pace of rice imports.  Global 2013/14 consumption is lowered 0.3 million tons, primarily due to smaller consumption forecast for Nigeria.  Global ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 108.6 million tons, up 0.8 million from last month, due primarily to an increase for Thailand.",
    "September_2022": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. corn outlook is for lower supplies, smaller feed and residual use, reduced exports and corn used for ethanol, and tighter ending stocks.  Projected beginning stocks for 2022/23 are 5 million bushels lower based on essentially offsetting export and corn used for ethanol changes for 2021/22.  Corn production for 2022/23 is forecast at 13.9 billion bushels, down 415 million from last month on reductions to harvested area and yield.  The national average yield is forecast at 172.5 bushels per acre, down 2.9 bushels.  Harvested area for grain is forecast at 80.8 million acres, down 1.0 million.  Total U.S. corn use is cut 250 million bushels to 14.3 billion.  Feed and residual use is lowered 100 million bushels based on a smaller crop and higher expected prices.  Exports are cut 100 million bushels to 2.3 billion while corn used for ethanol is lowered 50 million to 5.3 billion.  With supply falling more than use, ending stocks are down 169 million bushels to 1.2 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is raised 10 cents to $6.75 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2022/23 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, higher trade, and increased stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher with increases for China, Ukraine, Canada, and Mozambique more than offsetting reductions for the EU and Serbia.  China corn production is raised as abundant rainfall in key Northeast provinces and the North China Plain boost yield prospects.  Ukraine corn production is raised with an increase in yield expectations while Canada is higher based on greater indicated area.  EU corn production is lowered based on reductions for France, Romania, and Germany.  Foreign barley production is higher with larger production in Russia and Australia more than offsetting a decline for Syria.  Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2022/23 include larger corn exports for Ukraine but a reduction for the United States.  Corn imports are lowered for Canada and Vietnam.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised 2.2 million tons to 273.6 million, mostly reflecting increases for China and India that are partially offset by declines for Ukraine, the EU, and Thailand.  World corn ending stocks at 304.5 million tons, are down 2.2 million.RICE: The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced on a combination of lower beginning stocks and smaller production.  Beginning stocks are lowered on the NASS Rice Stocks report, issued August 19.  The NASS September Crop Production report reduced 2022/23 all rice production by 10.9 million cwt to 165.1 million on decreased harvested area and lower yields.  The average all rice yield is down 41 pounds per acre to 7,586 pounds.  This is the lowest U.S. rice production since 1993/94.  Long-grain production is reduced 8.0 million cwt to 132.3 million, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 2.9 million cwt to 32.8 million.  Total domestic and residual use is lowered by 4.0 million cwt to 141.0 million on the smaller crop size.  All rice exports are lowered 2.0 million cwt (all long-grain) to 77.0 million as U.S. rice is expected to be increasingly uncompetitive with lower supplies.  All rice ending stocks are decreased by 5.6 million cwt to 30.9 million, down 22 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price for all rice is raised $0.60 per cwt to a record $19.40 with increases for both the long-grain and the medium- and short-grain prices.The 2022/23 global outlook is for lower supplies, higher consumption, reduced trade, and lower stocks.  Supplies are reduced 4.4 million tons to 692.9 million primarily on lower production for China, India, and Pakistan.  China\u2019s production is reduced 2.0 million tons to 147.0 million on drought conditions in southern China.  India\u2019s production is lowered 2.0 million tons to 126.5 million on continued dry conditions in the northeast region.  This would be the first rice production decline for India since 2015/16.  Pakistan\u2019s production is decreased 500,000 tons to 8.4 million on expectations that August flooding reduced harvested area.  World 2022/23 consumption is raised 0.6 million tons to a record 519.3 million on higher use for India.  Global 2022/23 trade is reduced 1.1 million tons to 53.6 million on lower India exports that are partially offset by higher exports from Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and Pakistan.  India\u2019s exports are lowered 2.0 million tons to 20.0 million as India recently imposed export duties on rough, brown, and white milled rice and a ban on exports of brokens.  Projected 2022/23 world ending stocks are reduced by 5.0 million tons to 173.6 million, primarily on reductions for India and China.",
    "November_2013": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected U.S. feed grain supplies for 2013/14 are raised with higher estimated beginning stocks and increases in corn and sorghum production with the November Crop Production report.  Corn production is forecast 146 million bushels higher at a record 13,989 million bushels.  A 1.9-million-acre reduction in harvested area is more than offset by a 5.1-bushel-per-acre increase in the forecast yield.  At 160.4 bushels per acre, the national average yield remains 4.3 bushels per acre below the record in 2009/10.  Despite a late planted crop and July and August dryness across much of the Corn Belt, cooler-than-normal summer temperatures and an extended growing season have supported higher-than-expected yields for most producers.  Higher yields are forecast this month across the Plains, Corn Belt, and South.  Sorghum production is also higher, up 20 million bushels from the September forecast as higher area boosts production despite a lower yield.  A very small decrease is reported for oats production with the resurvey of North Dakota and Montana producers.  Production for both barley and oats were previously lowered in the Small Grains report.U.S. corn supplies for 2013/14 are projected 307 million bushels higher at a record 14,837 million bushels as this month\u2019s increase in production combines with higher beginning stocks from the September 30 Grain Stocks report.  Total corn use is raised 275 million bushels, offsetting much of the supply increase.  Feed and residual use is raised 100 million bushels with the larger crop.  Corn exports are projected 175 million bushels higher with larger supplies and lower prices that have increased the competitiveness of U.S. corn as indicated by strong outstanding export sales and rising export shipments in recent weeks.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 32 million bushels higher at 1,887 million.  The projected season-average farm price range for corn is lowered 30 cents at both ends to $4.10 to $4.90 per bushel.  Cash and futures prices have responded to rising yield prospects over the past 2 months, sharply reducing the outlook for 2013/14 farm prices.Other notable feed grain changes this month include higher projected 2013/14 exports for sorghum and small revisions to 2012/13 corn and sorghum use.  Corn and sorghum trade changes for 2012/13 are based on final August export data reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Corn use for ethanol production is lowered 17 million bushels for 2012/13 and 9 million bushels for 2011/12 based on revisions to calendar year 2012 ethanol production by the Energy Information Administration.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use for 2012/13 is also reduced based on lower 2012 ethanol production.Global coarse grain supplies for 2013/14 are projected 20.6 million tons higher compared with the September projection.  A combination of higher 2012/13 and 2013/14 production and reduced consumption for 2012/13, mostly for corn, boost 2013/14 coarse grain supplies.  Global 2013/14 coarse grain production is raised with a 6.2-million-ton increase in corn production.  More than half of the increase is for the United States.  Corn production is also raised for Russia, India, and the European Union.  Corn production for Brazil is reduced with lower expected area as declines in interior corn prices push expected returns into negative territory for the safrinha crop, which will not be planted until January.  Mexico production is also lowered.Global 2013/14 corn consumption is raised 5.5 million tons with foreign consumption up 3.0 million.  Corn feeding is raised for Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, India, Colombia, and Turkey.  Industrial use is raised for Brazil, but a larger reduction for China leaves foreign food, seed, and industrial use lower, partly offsetting the global increase in feed use.  World corn exports for 2013/14 are raised 7.7 million tons as lower prices are expected to boost demand.  Corn imports are raised for Mexico as sorghum imports are reduced.  Sorghum imports, however, are raised for China.  Corn imports are also raised for Egypt, the European Union, Colombia, and Turkey; all driven by higher expected feeding.  Corn imports are lowered for South Korea with an increase in wheat feeding.  In addition to the increase in U.S. corn exports, 2013/14 exports are also raised for Brazil, the European Union, and Russia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 12.9 million tons higher with most of the increase in China where consumption has been lowered for both 2012/13 and 2013/14.  Corn stock changes elsewhere are mostly offsetting.RICE:  All rice supplies for 2013/14 are increased nearly 3.2 million cwt or 1 percent from the September forecast due entirely to an increase in production.  U.S. all rice production in 2013/14 is forecast at 188.7 million cwt, 3.7 million or 2 percent above the September forecast due to an increase in yield.  Average all rice yield is estimated at a record 7,660 pounds per acre, up 149 pounds per acre from the September estimate.  Harvested area is unchanged at 2.46 million acres.  Long-grain rice production is up 2.5 million cwt to 129.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain rice production is raised 1.2 million cwt to 59.7 million cwt.  The all rice import forecast is lowered 0.5 million cwt to 22.0 million (all in long-grain) based on U.S. Census Bureau data to date and expectations of import needs for the remainder of the marketing year.On the use side for 2013/14, all rice domestic and residual use is unchanged from the September forecast; however, the export projection is increased 2.0 million cwt to 100.0 million.  Long-grain rice exports are raised 2.0 million cwt to 68.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain rice exports are unchanged at 32.0 million.  All rice ending stocks are forecast at 31.2 million cwt, up 4 percent from September, but down 15 percent from a year ago. The 2013/14 long-grain rice season-average farm price range is projected at $14.50 to $15.50 per cwt, up 50 cents on each end of the range from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $16.80 to $17.80 per cwt, up 50 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $15.20 to $16.20 per cwt, up 50 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  Global total supplies of rice for 2013/14 are lowered more than the decrease in total use resulting in a drop in world ending stocks.  World rice production is lowered 3.6 million tons from the September projection to 473.2 million, still a record, and 4.2 million larger than the preceding year.  The decline in global production is due mostly to lower production forecasts for Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, which are partially offset by increases for Bangladesh, Colombia, and the United States.  India\u2019s 2013/14 rice crop is lowered 3.0 million tons to 105.0 million because of unfavorable weather mostly in eastern and southeastern areas and a decrease in expected harvested area.  Cyclone Phailin and extremely heavy rains in the states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh have lowered crop prospects.  China\u2019s rice crop is lowered 0.5 million tons to 141.5 million based on a recent report from the Agricultural Counselor in Beijing.Global rice consumption for 2013/14 is lowered 1.5 million tons due mostly to a decline in India.  Global rice trade is changed little from the September projections; however, India\u2019s 2013/14 exports are raised 700,000 tons; and Pakistan and Vietnam are lowered 100,000 and 300,000 tons, respectively.  Export projections are also lowered for Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and Turkey.  Nigeria\u2019s imports are raised 600,000 tons to 3.0 million.  Global 2013/14 ending stocks are projected at 106.5 million tons, down 0.8 million from the September projection due mostly to decreases for China, India, and Pakistan, which is partially offset by an expected increase for Vietnam.",
    "September_2020": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced production, lower corn used for ethanol, larger exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.9 billion bushels, down 378 million from last month on a lower yield forecast and reduction in harvested area.  Corn supplies are reduced from last month, as a smaller crop more than offsets greater beginning stocks mostly due to lower estimated exports for 2019/20.  Corn used for ethanol for 2020/21 is lowered 100 million bushels based on the continued slow recovery in motor gasoline demand as a result of COVID-19.  Exports are raised 100 million bushels reflecting reduced supplies in competitor countries.  With supply falling more than use, corn ending stocks are lowered 253 million bushels from last month.  The corn price is raised 40 cents to $3.50 per bushel. This month\u2019s 2020/21 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, with fractionally higher trade and lower stocks relative to last month.  EU corn production is lowered, mostly reflecting a reduction for Romania.  Ukraine corn production is down, as acute short-term drought across much of the primary growing areas lowered corn yield prospects after a favorable start to the summer growing season.  Corn production is raised for Brazil, as high domestic prices are expected to support an expansion in area.  Corn production is also increased for India and Nigeria.  Barley production is raised for Russia, the EU, and Australia. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2020/21 include barley export increases for Russia and Australia.  Corn exports are raised for the United States, Brazil, and Mexico.  Corn imports are raised for Venezuela.  China\u2019s corn feed and residual use for 2019/20 and 2020/21 is raised from last month, based on observed soybean meal equivalent protein consumption and current corn prices.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lower relative to last month, as increases for India and Nigeria are more than offset by a decline for China. RICE:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. rice this month is for lower beginning stocks, with increased production, imports, and total use.  The August 21 NASS Rice Stocks report reduced 2020/21 beginning stocks by 2.0 million cwt.  Imports for 2020/21 are raised 0.8 million cwt to 36.8 million on expectations of continued strong demand for combined medium- and short-grain varieties.  In the September Crop Production report, NASS raised the 2020/21 rice crop by 6.9 million cwt to 225.0 million on increased harvested area.  The average all rice yield is down 71 pounds per acre to 7,529 pounds.  Long grain production is raised 9.8 million cwt to 168.9 million, and combined medium- and short-grain production is cut 3.0 million cwt to 56.0 million.  With the increased supplies, domestic and residual use and exports are each raised 2.0 million cwt, all long grain.  All rice ending stocks are increased by 1.6 million cwt to 45.9 million and the season-average farm price is dropped $0.10 per cwt to $12.60.  Foreign 2020/21 rice supplies are lowered fractionally with several, mostly offsetting, production changes led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for India and a 1.4-million-ton reduction for Thailand.  The India change is based on updated government statistics, and Thailand\u2019s smaller crop reflects limited water supplies in irrigated production areas.  Global exports are up fractionally led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for India that is offset by a 1.0-million-ton decrease for Thailand; both changes are based on each country\u2019s production revisions.  With supplies down and global utilization virtually unchanged, global ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons to 184.8 million but remain record large.",
    "September_2021": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, increased feed and residual use, greater exports, and higher ending stocks.  Projected beginning stocks for 2021/22 are 70 million bushels higher based on a lower use forecast for 2020/21, with reductions in corn used for ethanol and exports.  Corn production for 2021/22 is forecast at 15.0 billion bushels, up 246 million from last month on increases to harvested area and yield.  The national average yield is forecast at 176.3 bushels per acre, up 1.7 bushels, while harvested area for grain is forecast at 85.1 million acres, up 0.6 million.  Total U.S. corn use for 2021/22 is up 150 million bushels to 14.8 billion.  Feed and residual use is raised 75 million bushels based mostly on a larger crop and lower expected prices.  Exports for 2021/22 are up 75 million bushels to 2.5 billion.  With supply rising more than use, ending stocks are increased 166 million bushels to 1.4 billion.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 30 cents to $5.45 per bushel.  This month\u2019s 2021/22 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, greater trade, and increased stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher relative to last month with increases for China and Argentina more than offsetting reductions for Russia and Serbia.  China corn production is raised with a boost in yield prospects, based mostly on near to above normal rainfall in the key Northeast provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning.  Argentina corn production is raised based on expectations of higher area.  Foreign barley production is virtually unchanged, as increases for Australia, Ukraine, and the EU are essentially offset by declines for Canada and Russia. For China, corn feed and residual use for 2020/21 is lowered based on indicated soybean meal equivalent protein consumption and expanded use of alternative energy feedstuffs such as barley and sorghum.  For 2021/22, feed and residual use is raised based mostly on a larger crop and lower expected internal market prices.  Food, seed and industrial use is lowered for 2020/21 and 2021/22 based on a reduction in the expected amount of corn used for ethanol and corn product exports.  Despite a forecast increase in corn production, imports are unchanged for 2021/22 as the gap between China\u2019s domestic and international corn prices is expected to persist, particularly in the feed deficit South.Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2021/22 include larger corn exports for Argentina, with partly offsetting reductions for Serbia and Russia.  Corn imports are raised for Canada and Mexico but are reduced for Vietnam.  For 2020/21, for the local marketing year beginning March 2021 corn exports are lowered for Brazil but raised for Argentina.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2021/22 are raised 8.8 million tons to 261.9 million, mostly reflecting an increase for China. RICE: The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. rice this month is for reduced supplies, lower domestic use, unchanged exports, and smaller ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced mostly on smaller production, as NASS lowered 2021/22 rice production by 6.9 million cwt to 190.5 million on decreased harvested area more than offsetting a higher yield.  The average all rice yield is up 79 pounds per acre to 7,623 pounds, which is the third highest on record.  Long-grain production is reduced 5.8 million cwt to 144.2 million, and combined medium- and short-grain production is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 46.3 million.  Total domestic and residual use is lowered by 4.0 million cwt to 147.0 million on the smaller crop size.  All rice ending stocks are decreased by 3.1 million cwt to 34.2 million, down 22 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price for all rice is raised $0.30 per cwt to $14.80 with increases for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain.The 2021/22 global outlook is for increased supplies, lower consumption, increased trade, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are raised by 9.5 million tons to 693.9 million, primarily the result of a multi-year upward stocks revisions for India with a corresponding reduction for India\u2019s consumption.  India\u2019s production is also raised 1.0 million tons higher to 122.0 million on increased harvested area, which would be its second largest crop on record.  World 2021/22 consumption is lowered by 2.2 million tons to 512.1 million, primarily on lower consumption by India although global consumption remains at a record.  Global 2021/22 trade is raised 0.9 million tons to 48.5 million, mostly on increased exports by India on greater exportable supplies.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are increased by 11.7 million tons to 181.9 million, mainly on the cumulative effect of a multi-year upward revisions of India\u2019s stocks.  ",
    "July_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2015/16 U.S. feed grain supplies are lowered this month with reductions in corn beginning stocks and production.  Corn beginning stocks for 2015/16 are down 97 million bushels as increases in 2014/15 feed and residual use, use in ethanol production, and exports more than offset a small increase in imports.  Corn production for 2015/16 is projected down 100 million bushels reflecting the lower planted and harvested areas from the June 30 Acreage.  Sorghum, barley, and oats production are forecast higher based on the higher areas reported for all three crops and higher yields for barley and oats in today\u2019s Crop Production.Projected 2015/16 U.S. corn use is lowered with reductions for feed and residual use and exports more than offsetting higher expected corn use in ethanol production.  Projected feed and residual use is reduced 25 million bushels with lower production, higher expected supplies of distillers\u2019 grains, and the higher price outlook.  Exports are lowered 25 million bushels with increased competition expected from larger supplies in Brazil.  Use for ethanol is raised 25 million bushels with higher forecasts for 2015 and 2016 gasoline consumption in the latest outlook from the Energy Information Administration.  The higher gasoline consumption outlook also boosts expected 2014/15 corn use for ethanol by 25 million bushels.  This month\u2019s higher projections for 2014/15 corn feed and residual use and exports reflect the latest indications of disappearance from the June 1 stocks estimate and reported export shipments and sales to date.Other important 2015/16 feed grain changes include higher projected sorghum use, particularly for exports, and higher projected feed and residual use for sorghum and barley.  Ending stocks for sorghum, barley, and oats are all projected higher reflecting larger crops and supplies this month.Corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected 172 million bushels lower.  Projected season-average prices received by producers for 2015/16 are higher for all the feed grains with corn up 25 cents to $3.45 to $4.05 per bushel.  This is up 5 cents per bushel, at the midpoint, from this month\u2019s higher forecast for 2014/15.  At $3.60 to $3.80 per bushel, the 2014/15 corn price range is raised 5 cents on both ends.Global coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected down 4.3 million tons with much of the reduction from lower corn beginning stocks in the United States.  Foreign coarse grain beginning stocks are also lower with Brazil corn stocks down 1.5 million tons.  Brazil corn exports for 2014/15 are increased, outpacing this month\u2019s increase in 2014/15 production.  Globally, corn production for 2015/16 is lowered 2.2 million tons with reductions in the United States and EU only partly offset by increases for Brazil and China.  EU corn production is lowered 2.4 million tons as recent excessive heat and developing dryness across major growing areas reduces yield prospects.  Corn production is lowered 0.3 million tons for neighboring Serbia where heat and dryness are also concerns.  Brazil corn production is raised 2.0 million tons for 2015/16 with higher expected area for the crop that will be planted in the coming months.  China corn production is raised 1.0 million tons also on higher area.  Global barley and oats production for 2015/16 are lowered with reductions for EU and Canada.Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is raised 0.9 million tons, partly reflecting higher expected sorghum feeding and imports for China with the larger U.S. crop.  Corn feeding is raised for EU supported by larger imports as domestic grain supplies decline.  World barley consumption is lowered with reductions for EU, Australia, and Canada on tighter global supplies.  Brazil corn exports are raised for 2014/15 and 2015/16, up 2.5 million tons and 1.0 million tons, respectively.  EU corn imports are raised in both years.  Global 2015/16 corn ending stocks are projected 5.2 million tons lower mostly on the reduction expected for the United States.  Corn ending stocks are also expected lower for EU and Brazil.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 all rice supplies are lowered 11.0 million cwt to 278.4 million due to a production decrease.  Supplies of long-grain rice are lowered 12.5 million, but medium- and short-grain rice supplies are raised 1.5 million.  All rice production is lowered 12.0 million cwt to 207.0 million due mostly to a decrease in area with long-grain production reduced 9.5 million and medium- and short-grain rice lowered 2.5 million.  All rice planted area, as reported in Acreage is estimated at 2.77 million acres, with long-grain at 2.07 million, and medium- and short-grain area at 0.69 million.  Beginning stocks for 2015/16 are raised 1.0 million cwt to 46.4 million due to revisions made to 2014/15 all rice and rice-by-class supply and use.  All rice average yield is estimated at 7,544 pounds per acre.  All rice total use is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 240.0 million cwt, with domestic and residual use lowered 1.0 million cwt to 130.0 million, and exports unchanged at 110.0 million cwt.  Ending stocks are projected at 38.4 million cwt, down 10.0 million.U.S. 2014/15 all rice exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt, raising ending stocks by the same amount. Long-grain domestic and residual use and exports are raised; ending stocks lowered; and the season-average price increased.  Medium-and short-grain domestic and residual use and exports lowered; ending stocks raised and the average price unchanged.  June 1 Rice Stocks implied shifts in the rice-by-class domestic and residual use estimates.  Rice-by-class export estimates are based on U.S. Census Bureau trade data through May and the latest export sales data.U.S. long-grain 2015/16 rice season-average price is projected at $10.90 to $11.90 per cwt, up 90 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  Medium- and short-grain price is unchanged at $17.80 to $18.80 per cwt.  All rice price is projected at $13.00 to $14.00 per cwt, up 70 cents on each end of the range.  California medium- and short-grain price range is raised 50 cents.  Other States medium-and short-grain price midpoint is lowered 20 cents per cwt.Reduced global 2015/16 rice production leads to lower ending stocks.  World rice production is projected at 480.3 million tons, still a record, down 1.4 million from last month, but up 4.0 million from last year.  Rice crops are lowered for Australia, Madagascar, North Korea, Thailand, and the United States.  Dry conditions in principal rice growing areas of Thailand led to a 4-percent cut in production to 19.0 million tons, still slightly above 2014/15.  North Korea\u2019s crop is lowered 6 percent to 1.6 million tons due to dry conditions in the main rice producing region.  Australia\u2019s rice crop is lowered due to falling reservoir levels and a drop in expected planted area.  Global consumption and trade are lowered.  Thailand\u2019s export projection is reduced 0.8 million tons to 10.2 million because of tighter supplies.  Conversely, export projections are raised for Burma, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  Global ending stocks are projected at 90.5 million tons, down 0.9 million, the lowest since 2007/08.  The global stocks-to-use ratio at 18.5 percent is the lowest since 2006/07.  Ending stocks are lowered for Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States.",
    "June_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  The outlook for 2015/16 U.S. feed grain supplies is raised slightly this month with increases in corn and oats beginning stocks outweighing a decline for barley.  Projected corn production for 2015/16 is unchanged at 13,630 million bushels, 4 percent below last year\u2019s record level.  Corn beginning stocks for 2015/16 are raised with a 25-million-bushel reduction in 2014/15 forecast corn use in ethanol production based on data reported in the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report through April.  Corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1,771 million bushels, up 25 million bushels, the same as for beginning stocks.  The range for the 2015/16 season-average farm price is unchanged at $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel, compared with the 2014/15 range of $3.55 to $3.75 per bushel, which is also unchanged this month. Changes to 2015/16 oats and barley beginning stocks and supplies reflect 2014/15 changes to forecast trade.  Oats imports for 2014/15 are raised 2 million bushels on the latest indications of trade.  Barley exports for 2014/15 are projected 400,000 bushels larger also based on the latest indications.  Farm price projections for sorghum, barley, and oats are all unchanged this month for 2014/15 and 2015/16.Foreign coarse grain supplies for 2015/16 are projected up 2.8 million tons, mostly reflecting larger 2014/15 production and carryout for Brazil.  Brazil corn production for 2014/15 is raised 3 million tons to a near-record 81.0 million with higher area reported for the second or safrinha crop that will be harvested over the coming months.  Yields are also projected higher reflecting extended rainfall through May, well beyond the normal end of the rainy season in central west Brazil.  Global corn production for 2015/16 is projected down 0.5 million tons with reductions for Zambia, Nepal, Zimbabwe, and EU more than offsetting a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia.  Russia 2015/16 corn production is raised 1.0 million tons on a higher area and yield.  Planting progress data indicate a year-to-year increase in seeded area, which is also reflected in higher year-to-year imports of agricultural chemicals.  While hybrid seed imports have been reported down from last year, these imports have also been stronger than expected as corn remained a favorable alternative compared with other spring crops.Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is raised slightly supported by higher expected corn trade.  Foreign corn exports are raised for 2015/16 with a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia as higher production makes the country\u2019s corn supplies very competitive in the Middle East and North Africa.  Corn exports are raised 0.3 million tons for Zambia, despite this month\u2019s lowered production outlook, as demand for imported corn, especially white corn, soars in the region with crop shortfalls in Zimbabwe and South Africa.  Global corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected 3.3 million tons higher mostly on the higher stocks expected for Brazil.  Small reductions in corn stocks for Russia and EU offset most of the increase projected this month for the United States.RICE:  U.S. rice 2015/16 supply and use balance sheets are little changed from last month.  All rice beginning stocks are raised 2.5 million cwt with long-grain rice stocks raised 0.5 million, and medium- and short-grain stocks raised 2.0 million.  All rice imports are raised 0.5 million cwt to 25.0 million (all long-grain), up 2 percent from revised 2014/15.  Medium- and short-grain exports are raised 2.0 million cwt to 34.0 million as a large outstanding sales balance to Northeast Asia in 2014/15 will likely be shipped in 2015/16.  The large balance was caused in part due to work slowdowns and stoppages at ports along the West Coast earlier this year.  This labor dispute has since been resolved, but a large backlog at the ports still exists.  Additionally, Turkey has not accepted some U.S. medium-grain rice shipments in 2014/15 for phytosanitary reasons in recent months.  The long-grain export projection is unchanged at 76.0 million cwt, but up 4 percent from the previous year.  Long-grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised 1.0 million cwt to 35.1 million, up 23 percent from 2014/15, and the largest since 2010/11.  Medium- and short-grain ending stocks are forecast at 11.0 million cwt, unchanged from last month, but 24 percent below the previous year\u2019s revised estimate.The U.S. 2015/16 long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $10.00 to $11.00 per cwt, unchanged from last month compared to $11.90 to $12.10 for the previous year.  The combined medium- and short-grain price is unchanged at $17.80 to $18.80 per cwt compared to $17.80 to $18.20 for the year earlier.  The 2015/16 all rice price is projected at $12.30 to $13.30 per cwt, compared to $13.20 to $13.60 per cwt for 2014/15.  The California and Other States medium-and short-grain prices are unchanged from last month.Global 2015/16 rice supply and use is little changed from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at a record 481.7 million tons, 0.4 million below a month ago.  Brazil\u2019s rice crop is forecast at 8.0 million tons, down 0.3 million from last month, a result of a reduction in area.  This crop will not be planted until October-December 2015.  The change is based mostly on a reduction in the 2014/15 rice crop based on recent estimates from the government of Brazil.  Global consumption is nearly unchanged at a record 489.0 million tons.  Global 2015/16 trade (imports and exports) are also nearly unchanged from a month ago.  World export projections are raised slightly for Guyana and the United States.  Global ending stocks are forecast at 91.4 million tons, down slightly from last month, down 7.2 million from the previous year, and the smallest stocks since 2007/08.  The global stocks-to-use ratio at 18.7 percent is unchanged from a month ago, but down 1.7 points from the previous year, and the lowest since 2006/07. ",
    "November_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. corn outlook is for larger production, increased food, seed and industrial (FSI) use and slightly higher prices.  Corn production is forecast at 15.226 billion bushels, up 168 million from last month on a 1.9-bushel per acre increase in yield to 175.3 bushels per acre.  Non-ethanol FSI from 2013/14 to 2015/16 is raised this month based on updated usage estimates.  With stocks known, concomitant reductions are made in feed and residual use for those years.  For 2016/17, corn used for ethanol is projected 25 million bushels higher from last month, while non-ethanol FSI is raised 60 million bushels.  A detailed breakout of the corn FSI estimates is available at the Economic Research Service Feed Grains Database: http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database.aspx.  With supply rising faster than use, corn ending stocks are raised 83 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is raised 5 cents on both ends to $3.00 to $3.60 per bushel, based on higher-than-expected observed early-season prices. Global coarse grain production for 2016/17 is forecast 4.9 million tons higher to 1,319.7 million.  This month\u2019s 2016/17 foreign coarse grain outlook is for greater production and consumption, increased trade, and lower stocks relative to last month.  Historical revisions are made to several countries this month, including Egypt, Tunisia, and Vietnam.  Corn production is raised for Ukraine, based on near-record yields reported by the government through early November.  Russia corn production is higher this month with a projected record yield, based on harvest results to date.  Partly offsetting are corn production reductions for Vietnam and Bolivia.  Corn exports are projected higher for Ukraine and Russia.  Notable month-to-month increases in corn imports are forecast for Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Partly offsetting are reductions in imports for Indonesia and South Korea.  Policy restrictions are expected to limit corn imports by Indonesia, while South Korea\u2019s corn purchase pace has moderated.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are lowered 0.7 million tons, with the largest stock declines projected for Vietnam and Indonesia, partly offset by increases expected for Ukraine and Russia. RICE:  The 2016/17 U.S. rice crop is reduced 1.2 million cwt to 234.8 million on lower yields.  Ending stocks are lowered by the same amount.  The average yield forecast is reduced 39 pounds per acre to 7,493.  Arkansas and Missouri were the only states to have reductions.  The long-grain crop is reduced 0.9 million cwt to 176.1 million but still the largest since the 2010/11 record.  Medium- and short-grain production is down 0.3 million cwt to 58.7 million.  Total exports are unchanged, but rough exports are raised 1.0 million cwt, which is offset by a 1.0-million-cwt reduction in milled exports.  The all rice marketing year average price received by producers is lowered $0.10 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $10.10 to $11.10 on lower Southern medium-grain prices.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are raised 1.3 million tons on a 0.5-million-ton increase in production and higher beginning stocks.  The increased beginning stocks are largely on reduced 2015/16 Indian domestic use.  Trade for 2016/17 is cut 0.2 million tons and domestic use is up 0.2 million tons.  With supplies rising faster than total use, world ending stocks are raised 1.0 million tons.  ",
    "September_2019": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for reduced production, lower corn used for ethanol, and slightly higher ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 13.799 billion bushels, down 102 million from last month on a lower yield forecast.  Corn supplies are down from last month, as a smaller crop more than offsets larger beginning stocks due to lower estimated exports and corn used for ethanol for 2018/19.  Corn used for ethanol for 2019/20 is lowered 25 million bushels.  With use falling more than supply, corn ending stocks are up 9 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged at $3.60 per bushel. This month\u2019s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for virtually unchanged production, with fractionally lower trade and stocks relative to last month.  Ukraine corn production is lowered, as dry conditions during the month of August reduce yield prospects for filling corn.  EU corn production is unchanged, as reductions for France and Germany offset increases for Bulgaria and Romania.  Barley production is raised for Russia, Ukraine, the EU, and Kazakhstan, but lowered for Australia and Canada. Major global coarse grain trade changes for 2019/20 include barley export increases for Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia, with a partly offsetting reduction for Australia.  For 2018/19, corn exports for Brazil are raised for the local marketing year beginning March 2019, based on record large shipments during the month of August.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2019/20 are lower relative to last month, mostly reflecting declines for Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico, Paraguay, and Chile. RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for much lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks.  The August 23 NASS Rice Stocks report indicated lower 2018/19 ending stocks than previously estimated, thereby reducing 2019/20 beginning stocks by 5.7 million cwt.  In the September Crop Production report, NASS reduced the 2019/20 crop by 18.1 million cwt to 187.3 million on lower harvested area and yields.  NASS incorporated FSA certified acreage data this month, and all rice planted area is lowered by 216,000 acres, the result of excessive precipitation at planting time especially in the upper Mississippi River Delta.  Long-grain planted area is lowered 278,000 acres while combined medium- and short-grain area is up 62,000 acres.  The average all rice yield is down 14 pounds per acre to 7,563 pounds.  Long-grain production is cut 22.4 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production is raised 4.4 million.  All rice supplies are lowered 23.4 million cwt to 261.8 million, which is 7 percent below last year.  Domestic and residual use and exports are each lowered 6.0 million cwt on the lower supplies.  All rice ending stocks are lowered 11.4 million cwt to 35.8 million and the season-average farm price is raised $1.00 per cwt to $13.20.  Global 2019/20 supplies are lowered 3.1 million tons, led by a 3.0-million-ton crop reduction for India and a 0.6-million-ton reduction for the United States.  Beginning stocks are raised 0.5 million tons.  World 2019/20 exports are lowered 1.5 million tons with India down 0.8 million tons on the smaller crop and Thailand down 0.5 million tons on a slow pace and lack of price competitiveness in international markets.  Global consumption is cut 1.2 million tons, and world ending stocks are lowered 1.9 million tons to 172.7 million, but both remain record large.  ",

    "November_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for larger production, increased feed and residual use and exports, and greater ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.578 billion bushels, up 298 million from last month on a record-high yield. Feed and residual use is raised 75 million bushels based on a larger crop.  Exports are raised 75 million bushels, reflecting expectations of improved U.S. competitiveness, reduced exports for Ukraine, and increased demand from Mexico based on sharply lower sorghum production prospects.  With supply rising faster than use, corn ending stocks are up 147 million bushels from last month.  The projected range for the season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged with a midpoint of $3.20 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2017/18 is forecast 3.2 million tons higher to 1,322.6 million.  The 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, reduced consumption, and smaller stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast lower mostly reflecting reductions for Ukraine, Russia, and Vietnam that are only partially offset by an increase for the European Union.  The projected corn yields for Russia and Ukraine are reduced based on reported harvest results to date.  Sorghum production in Mexico is lowered based on area indications from the government and lower forecast yields as a result of the prevalence of the sugarcane aphid. Corn exports are lowered for Ukraine but raised for the United States.  Imports are raised for Mexico and Canada, but lowered for South Korea.  China\u2019s barley imports are raised reflecting expectations of continued demand for imported feedstuffs.  Foreign corn ending stocks are down from last month, mostly reflecting declines for China, Vietnam, Canada, and Ukraine that more than offset increases for the EU and Argentina.  Global corn stocks, at 203.9 million tons, are up 2.9 million from last month.RICE: Total 2017/18 U.S. rice supplies are increased marginally this month to 248.9 million cwt as higher projected imports (primarily Thai fragrant rice) offset slightly lower production.  In the November Crop Production report, NASS reduced the 2017/18 U.S. crop size by 0.2 million cwt to 178.4 million on lower forecast yield.  This is 20 percent less than last year and would be the lowest U.S. rice production since 1996/97.  Projected U.S. rice exports are reduced by 2 million cwt to 104 million, down 1 million each for both long- and medium- and short- grain rice to 74 and 30 million cwt, respectively.  Exports for both classes are projected lower than last year due to reduced exportable supplies, greater competition, and higher U.S. prices.  Projected 2017/18 ending stocks are increased 2.1 million cwt to 29.9 million, still the lowest all rice ending stocks since 2007/08.  The projected 2017/18 season-average farm price for all rice is reduced 20 cents at both ends of the range to $12.50 to $13.50 per cwt based on monthly NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the rest of the marketing year.  The midpoint of $13.00 per cwt is $2.60 above the previous year.Global 2017/18 rice supplies are decreased to 619.3 million tons, primarily on a smaller crop projected for India.  World 2017/18 consumption is down fractionally to 480.4 million tons.  Global 2017/18 trade is raised to 44.9 million tons on higher exports by Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and China more than offsetting reductions for India, Pakistan, and the United States.  Trade is still below the 2016/17 record of 45.3 million tons.  World ending stocks are lowered this month to 138.9 million tons for 2017/18, still higher than last year and at the highest level since 2000/01.",

Other feed grain balance sheet items are unchanged for both marketing years.  Projected corn production for 2014/15 is unchanged at a record 13,935 million bushels.  The projected U.S. corn yield remains at 165.3 bushels per acre as a slightly slower-than-normal mid-May planting progress is expected to be offset by very favorable early season crop and weather conditions.  U.S. crop conditions in the most recent Crop Progress report are the best in 4 years for the aggregated 18 reported states and better than any time since 2007 for the Corn Belt.  The projected range for the 2014/15 season-average farm price is unchanged at $3.85 to $4.55 per bushel and below this month\u2019s lower projected 2013/14 range of $4.45 to $4.65 per bushel.  The 2013/14 price range is lowered 10 cents per bushel at the midpoint based on prices reported to date and the recent decline in nearby cash and futures prices. Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 2.3 million tons higher mostly with larger corn beginning stocks and production.  Higher 2013/14 corn production for Brazil and India raise 2014/15 beginning stocks for both countries.  Lower 2013/14 corn exports for Argentina also add to 2014/15 beginning stocks.  Higher 2013/14 corn imports boost 2014/15 beginning stocks for Colombia, Egypt, and Turkey.  Ukraine and China 2014/15 corn beginning stocks are lowered with higher 2013/14 exports for Ukraine and lower 2013/14 imports for China.  Despite an increase in 2013/14 South Africa corn production, 2014/15 beginning stocks decline with higher 2013/14 consumption and exports.Global corn production for 2014/15 is raised 2.0 million tons with increases for Ukraine, the European Union, and Russia.  Ukraine and Russia production are raised 1.0 million tons and 0.5 million tons, respectively, on higher expected yields as the latest trade data for both countries confirm further expansion in the use of imported hybrid seed corn.  European Union production is raised 0.6 million tons with increases for Germany and central Europe reflecting improved early season growing conditions in the region.  Serbia corn output is reduced slightly with less expected area.  Global 2014/15 coarse grain trade is mostly unchanged this month except for small increases in corn and barley imports for Turkey.  Global corn consumption is raised 1.8 million tons with increased feed use projected for Turkey, the European Union, Ukraine, and Russia.  Global corn ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected 0.9 million tons higher with increases for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, and Russia partly offset by reductions for China, Ukraine, and South Africa.RICE:  Rice supply and use 2014/15 balance sheets are changed little from last month.  All rice beginning stocks for 2014/15 are raised 3.0 million cwt, long-grain rice stocks are raised 2.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain stocks are up 1.0 million.  The 2014/15 beginning stocks changes flow through the balance sheets to 2014/15 ending stocks.  All rice 2014/15 ending stocks are raised 3.0 million cwt to 37.3 million\u2014the largest stocks since 2011/12.  Long-grain ending stocks are raised 2.0 million cwt to 26.3 million\u2014the largest since 2010/11.  Combined medium- and short-grain ending stocks are raised 1.0 million cwt to 8.7 million.All rice 2013/14 exports are lowered 3.0 million cwt to 92.0 million, long-grain exports are lowered 2.0 million to 62.0 million, and combined medium- and short-grain rice exports are lowered 1.0 million to 30.0 million.  Rough rice exports and milled rice exports for 2013/14 are each lowered 1.5 million cwt to 31.5 million and 60.5 million (rough-equivalent basis), respectively.  U.S. exports and export commitments to Central America, Africa, Venezuela, and Northeast Asia are lagging through May compared to a year ago.  The 2014/15 U.S. long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $12.80 to $13.80 per cwt, down 70 cents per cwt on each end from a month ago and compares to a revised $15.10 to $15.70 per cwt for 2013/14.  The 2014/15 combined medium- and short-grain rice season-average farm price is $18.20 to $19.20 per cwt, a decrease of 30 cents per cwt on each end from last month and compares to a revised $17.40 to $18.00 per cwt for 2013/14. The 2014/15 U.S. all rice season-average farm price is projected at $14.40 to $15.40 per cwt, down 60 cents per cwt on each end from a month ago and compares to a revised $15.70 to $16.30 per cwt for 2013/14.Global 2014/15 rice supply and use is little changed from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at a record 480.7 million tons, unchanged from a month ago.  Global 2014/15 trade (imports and exports) are unchanged from a month ago.  Global 2014/15 consumption is lowered slightly from last month.  Ending stocks for 2014/15 are raised 0.9 million tons due mostly to an increase for India.  Rice production for 2013/14 in India is raised 1.3 million tons to a record 106.3 million tons based on official statistics from the government of India.",
    "July_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2014/15 U.S. feed grain supplies are raised with increases for corn and sorghum beginning stocks and higher expected sorghum production.  Corn production is projected 75 million bushels lower based on harvested acres from the June 30 Acreage report.  The national average corn yield remains projected at a record 165.3 bushels per acre.  Favorable early July crop conditions and weather support an outlook for record yields across most of the Corn Belt, however, for much of the crop, the critical pollination period will be during middle and late July.  At the projected 13,860 million bushels, this year\u2019s crop remains just 65 million bushels below last year\u2019s record.    Corn use changes for 2014/15 are limited to a 50-million-bushel reduction in expected feed and residual use based on the lower production projection and higher projected sorghum feed and residual use.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use, exports, and ending stocks are also raised for 2014/15 with sorghum production projected up 50 million bushels on the higher area reported in the Acreage report.  Corn ending stocks are projected up 75 million bushels with a higher carryin and lower feed and residual use more than offsetting the small acreage-driven decline in production.  The projected range for the season-average corn price is lowered 20 cents on each end to $3.65 to $4.35 per bushel.  Lower farm prices are also projected for sorghum, barley, and oats.A number of 2013/14 feed grain supply and use changes are made this month reflecting June 1 stocks estimates from the June 30 Grain Stocks and based on final marketing-year barley and oats trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  Projected corn feed and residual use is lowered 125 million bushels based on lower-than-expected March-May disappearance as indicated by the June 1 stocks.  Corn used to produce ethanol is projected 25 million bushels higher based on the pace of ethanol production to date and lower projected sorghum food, seed, and industrial use, most of which is for ethanol.  Sorghum exports are projected up 10 million bushels reflecting continued steady export sales and the large 2013/14 outstanding sales balance.  Projected 2013/14 farm prices for corn and sorghum are lowered this month as favorable weather for developing 2014 crops reduce summer price prospects.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 7.0 million tons higher with larger beginning stocks for the United States, Brazil, and China and larger production for China, the EU, Ukraine, Russia, and Serbia.  Lower corn production for the United States and lower corn, barley, and oats production for Canada partly offset this month\u2019s increases in world coarse grain output.  World barley production is higher with larger crops expected in Ukraine and Russia.  Foreign corn production for 2014/15 is raised 1.7 million tons.  China corn production is up 2.0 million tons on higher expected area.  China 2013/14 corn production is also raised, up 0.8 million tons based on the latest government estimates that include higher area.  EU 2014/15 corn production is raised 0.4 million with larger crops expected in Germany and France.  Serbia corn production is also raised 0.3 million tons.  Partly offsetting is a 0.9-million-ton reduction in Canada corn reflecting the lower planted area recently reported by Statistics Canada.  Brazil corn production is unchanged for 2014/15, but raised 2.0 million tons for 2013/14 based on higher area indications for second crop corn.Global 2014/15 corn trade is nearly unchanged with a reduction for Canada exports partly offset by an increase for Serbia.  For 2013/14, world corn trade is raised with higher imports for the EU and South Korea more than offsetting a reduction for China.  Corn exports for 2013/14 are raised for Canada, the EU, and Russia.  Global corn consumption is lowered slightly for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 mostly reflecting the lower U.S. feed and residual use projections. Global 2014/15 corn ending stocks are projected 5.4 million tons higher with increases for China, Brazil, and the United States more than offsetting the Canada reduction.RICE:  U.S. all rice supplies in 2014/15 are raised 12.5 million cwt or nearly 5 percent to 279.8 million, the highest since 2010/11, as beginning stocks and production are raised 0.5 million and 13.0 million, respectively.  Conversely, the import forecast is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 21.0 million.  All rice production for 2014/15 is forecast at 226.0 million cwt, up 13.0 million or 6 percent due entirely to an increase in area.  All rice average yield is estimated at 7,469 pounds per acre, nearly the same as last month, but 3 percent below record 2013/14.  All rice total use for 2014/15 is raised 10.0 million cwt or 4 percent to 240.0 million, the highest since 2010/11, as domestic and residual use and exports are each increased 5.0 million to 133.0 million and 107.0 million, respectively.  Ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 39.8 million cwt, up 2.5 million.Changes to U.S. 2013/14 rice supply and use include larger imports, lower domestic and residual use, larger exports, and higher ending stocks.  All rice imports for 2013/14 are forecast at 23.0 million cwt, up 1.0 million from last month, due mostly to an unexpectedly large May shipment of broken rice from Thailand reported by the Bureau of the Census.  Domestic and residual use for 2013/14 is lowered 1.0 million cwt to 123.0 million based largely on NASS\u2019 Rice Stocks report showing larger than expected stocks as of June 1.  Exports for 2013/14 are raised 1.5 million cwt to 93.5 million based on data from the Bureau of the Census through May and data from the weekly U.S. Export Sales report through early July.The 2014/15 U.S. long-grain rice season-average farm price is projected at $12.00 to $13.00 per cwt, down 80 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.  The 2014/15 combined medium- and short-grain price is projected at $17.00 to $18.00 per cwt, down $1.20 per cwt from a month ago.  The 2014/15 all rice price is projected at $13.50 to $14.50 per cwt, down 90 cents per cwt on each end of the range from last month.  Larger domestic supplies of both long-grain rice and medium-grain rice along with plentiful supplies among most of the major global exporters will exert downward pressure on prices.Global 2014/15 rice supplies are reduced due to both lower beginning stocks and production.  Beginning stocks for 2014/15 are lowered 0.6 million tons due chiefly to reductions for China and the Philippines, partially offset by an increase for Vietnam.  Global production is projected at a record 479.4 million tons, down 1.3 million from last month owing mostly to a decrease in India, partially offset by increases for Vietnam and the United States.  India\u2019s 2014/15 rice crop is projected at 104.0 million tons, down 2.0 million from last month attributed to the slow and erratic start to the Southwest Monsoon.  Global trade and consumption are changed little from a month ago.  U.S. 2014/15 exports are raised 160,000 tons from a month ago.  World ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 108.5 million tons, down 2.1 million from last month, and 3.0 million below the revised 2013/14 stocks forecast.  Ending stocks projections for 2014/15 are lowered for India, China, and the Philippines, partially offsetting increases for Brazil, Vietnam, and the United States.",
    "July_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2016/17 U.S. feed grain supplies are raised this month as lower beginning stocks are more than offset by increased production.  Corn beginning stocks for 2016/17 are lowered 7 million bushels as reductions in 2015/16 feed and residual use and use for ethanol production are more than offset by increases in exports and seed use.  Corn production for 2016/17 is projected 110 million bushels higher reflecting the increased planted and harvested areas from the June 30 Acreage report.  Projected sorghum production for 2016/17 is raised 13 million bushels on higher expected harvested area.  Oats production is forecast 9 million bushels higher and barley production is forecast 10 million bushels lower in today\u2019s Crop Production report mostly reflecting area adjustments in the Acreage report. Projected 2016/17 U.S. corn use is raised 30 million bushels as increased prospects for exports and higher seed use more than offset lower projected use for feed and residual and ethanol production.  Exports are projected 100 million bushels higher on reduced competition from Brazil, as reflected by new-crop export sales that are well above a year ago.  Projected feed and residual use for 2016/17 is lowered, despite the larger crop, reflecting implications of the lower-than-expected disappearance for 2015/16 indicated by the June 30 Grain Stocks report.  Projected corn use for ethanol is lowered 25 million bushels in line with changes for 2015/16 driven by the latest data from the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report.  Corn seed use is revised higher back to 1995/96 to better reflect rising plant populations reported in the NASS objective yield survey data.  Updated seed use estimates will be available in this month\u2019s Economic Research Service Feed Outlook and from the Feed Grains Database at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database.aspx. Corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected 73 million bushels higher.  Projected season-average prices received by producers for 2016/17 are lowered for all the feed grains, with corn down 10 cents to $3.10 to $3.70 per bushel.  For 2015/16 the corn price is lowered 5 cents at the midpoint to a range of $3.60 to $3.70 per bushel. Global coarse grain supplies for 2016/17 are projected slightly lower this month.  Coarse grain beginning stocks are down slightly from last month mostly reflecting reductions in barley for the EU and corn for Brazil.  Partly offsetting are higher corn stocks for China and Mexico.  Global coarse grain output is largely unchanged with lower corn and barley production mostly offset by higher oats, sorghum, and rye production.  Brazil corn production for 2016/17 is reduced 2.0 million tons based on lowered yield expectations.  Canada corn production for 2016/17 is lowered 1.3 million tons based on the latest area information from Statistics Canada and lower yield prospects following one of the driest Junes in over 30 years in Ontario.  Global barley production for 2016/17 is lowered, mostly on reductions for Turkey, Canada, Algeria, and Morocco, which more than offset increases for Australia, Ukraine and Uruguay. Brazil corn production for 2015/16 is lowered 7.5 million tons reflecting the latest government statistics which confirm the adverse impact of this year\u2019s early end to the rainy season in much of central Brazil.  An unusual early June freeze also adversely affected second-crop corn in Parana following what had been a generally favorable growing season.  Argentina corn production for 2015/16 is raised 1.0 million tons based on harvest data reported to date.Global 2016/17 coarse grain consumption is lowered 3.3 million tons, mostly reflecting reduced corn feeding for the United States, Brazil, China, EU, South Korea, and Indonesia.  Larger global supplies of feed-quality wheat are expected to undercut corn in price sensitive markets in the EU and Asia.  EU corn imports are lowered for 2015/16 and 2016/17 with greater wheat and barley feeding.  Brazil corn exports are lowered for 2015/16 and 2016/17, down 4.0 million tons and 1.0 million tons, respectively.  Global 2016/17 corn ending stocks are projected 3.3 million tons higher mostly on a 2.1-million-ton increase for China.  Outside of China, corn stocks are 1.2 million tons higher with larger stocks for the United States and Indonesia more than offsetting reductions for Brazil, Japan, and Canada.  RICE: U.S. 2016/17 all rice supplies are raised 12.0 million cwt to 309.9 million on a production increase that is partially offset by lower beginning stocks.  Long-grain production is raised 2.0 million cwt while combined medium- and short-grain production is raised 12.0 million cwt.  The production increase reflects the 148,000 acre increase in planted area (mostly California medium- and short-grain rice) from NASS\u2019 June Acreage report.  Harvested area is forecast at 3.2 million acres, up 24 percent from the previous year.  Beginning stocks are reduced 2.0 million cwt on an equivalent increase in 2015/16 exports.  For 2016/17, all rice domestic and residual use and exports are each raised 3.0 million cwt to 138.0 million and 115.0 million, respectively.  Ending stocks are unchanged for long-grain, but raised 6.0 million to 16.5 million for medium- and short-grain.  All rice ending stocks are now forecast at 56.9 million cwt, the largest since 1985/86.  The all rice season-average farm price is lowered $0.40 per cwt at the midpoint to a projected range of $11.20 to $12.20, reflecting lower expected California prices.  Global rice supplies for 2016/17 are raised 0.6 million tons primarily on the larger U.S. crop.  Several mostly offsetting changes are made for 2015/16 and 2016/17 exports, imports, and domestic use.  Global ending stocks for 2016/17 are raised 0.4 million tons to 107.3 million.   ",
    "June_2016": "COARSE GRAINS:  The 2016/17 outlook for U.S. feed grain supplies is lowered this month with declines for corn, sorghum, and oats beginning stocks more than offsetting an increase for barley.  Projected corn production for 2016/17 is unchanged at a record 14,430 million bushels.  Corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are reduced 95 million bushels as a 100-million-bushel increase in the corn export forecast more than offsets a slightly higher import projection.  As of early June, total U.S. corn export commitments (accumulated exports plus outstanding sales) are above year-ago levels for the first time in the 2015/16 marketing year.  Reduced corn production in Brazil and harvest delays in Argentina have improved the relative competitiveness of U.S. corn in recent weeks.  The U.S. corn export projection for 2016/17 is raised 50 million bushels as U.S. supplies are expected to remain more competitive in 2016/17 with less production for Brazil.  Corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 2,008 million bushels, down 145 million from last month. Changes to 2016/17 sorghum beginning stocks reflect higher 2015/16 forecasts for sorghum use.  Projected exports are raised 15 million bushels based on recent food aid shipments and increased export sales.  Food, seed, and industrial use is expected 10 million bushels higher based on reported sorghum use for ethanol production in the latest Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report.  Projected feed and residual use and ending stocks are both lowered.The season-average farm price for corn is raised for both 2015/16 and 2016/17.  The 2015/16 price is forecast up 10 cents per bushel at the midpoint with a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per bushel.  The 2016/17 price is projected 15 cents per bushel higher at the midpoint with a range of $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel.  Price outlooks for the other feed grains in 2016/17 are also raised this month.Foreign coarse grain supplies for 2016/17 are projected up 5.3 million tons, driven mostly by larger corn production in Mexico and greater barley production in the EU and Ukraine.  Brazil corn production for 2015/16 is lowered 3.5 million tons to 77.5 million, as an early end to the rainy season in west-central Brazil has reduced yields for second-crop corn.  Mexico corn production is raised 1.0 million tons for 2015/16 based on revisions to official government estimates and 0.7 million tons for 2016/17 reflecting a favorable start to the rainy season and improved reservoir levels.  EU barley production for 2016/17 is raised 2.3 million tons, as abundant rainfall and excellent growing conditions during grain fill boost yield prospects for Spain.  Ukraine barley production is raised 0.9 million tons on higher area as the impact of fall dryness was not as large as previously expected. Global 2016/17 coarse grain consumption is raised 4.1 million tons with larger corn and barley feeding for Iran and greater barley feeding for the EU and Saudi Arabia.  Reductions in 2015/16 and 2016/17 Brazil corn exports are offset by higher exports for the United States and reduced imports for the EU and Mexico.  Global corn ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected 1.9 million tons lower as the reduction for the United States more than offsets higher foreign stocks.  At the projected 205.1 million tons, world corn stocks are expected to decline slightly in 2016/17.RICE:  U.S. 2015/16 rice ending stocks are lowered 0.5 million cwt this month to 42.9 million on a 1.0-million-cwt increase in exports which is partially offset by a 0.5-million-cwt increase in imports.  The larger exports are based on a faster-than-expected pace of sales of southern medium- and short-grain rice to North Africa and the Middle East.  Exports for 2016/17 are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 112.0 million, with reductions for medium- and short-grain, due to tightening supplies.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are raised 0.5 million cwt to 50.9 million, and are the largest ending stocks since the mid-1980\u2019s.  The 2015/16 all rice season-average price is lowered $0.10 per cwt on both the high and low ends of the range.  The 2016/17 all rice price is raised $0.30 per cwt at the midpoint based on stronger-than-expected forward prices for long-grain rice and strengthening prices in international markets.  Global rice supplies are raised fractionally for both 2015/16 and 2016/17.  The largest change is a 0.5-million-ton increase in 2015/16 India production to 103.5 million on updated government data.  Only slight changes are made this month to global trade, use, and ending stocks for both the 2015/16 and 2016/17 marketing years.  ",
    "November_2015": "COARSE GRAINS:  Projected 2015/16 U.S. feed grain supplies are raised this month on higher forecast production for corn and sorghum.  Corn production is forecast 99 million bushels higher with the national average yield raised 1.3 bushels per acre to 169.3 bushels, just 1.7 bushels below last year\u2019s record.  Projected domestic corn use for 2015/16 is lowered 50 million bushels as a 25-million-bushel increase in expected feed and residual use, with the larger crop and lower expected prices, is more than offset by a 75-million-bushel reduction in corn used to produce ethanol.  The reduced outlook for corn use for ethanol is driven by significant adjustments to the 2015/16 sorghum balance sheet this month.  U.S. sorghum exports for 2015/16 are projected 105 million bushels lower.  Declining premiums for sorghum offered by exporters and large price discounts for sorghum relative to corn in interior cash markets drive expectations for higher use in ethanol production and higher feed and residual use.Total U.S. corn use for 2015/16 is projected 100 million bushels lower with exports lowered 50 million bushels.  U.S. corn export sales and shipments lag well behind last year at this time and U.S. supplies remain uncompetitive in many foreign markets as corn from Brazil continues to undercut U.S. offerings.  U.S. corn ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected 199 million bushels higher at 1,760 million.  End-of-year stocks are projected 29 million bushels higher than those reported for 2014/15.  The 2015/16 season-average corn price received by producers is projected 15 cents lower on both ends this month to $3.35 to $3.95 per bushel.This month\u2019s sharp rise in 2015/16 global coarse grain supplies is driven mostly by downward revisions to China corn feeding for 2013/14 through 2015/16.  China corn beginning stocks are raised 18.8 million tons for 2015/16 reflecting the impact of lower estimated feed use for the preceding marketing years.  Partly offsetting the increase in China is a 7.0-million-ton reduction for 2015/16 Brazil corn beginning stocks.  Brazil corn feeding is raised for 2006/07 through 2011/12.  (Balance sheet revisions for China and Brazil with a comparison to the October estimates and projections will be available at http://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/historical.htm following today\u2019s WASDE release.)  This month\u2019s sharp rise in 2015/16 global coarse grain supplies is driven mostly by downward revisions to China corn feeding for 2013/14 through 2015/16.  China corn beginning stocks are raised 18.8 million tons for 2015/16 reflecting the impact of lower estimated feed use for the preceding marketing years.  Partly offsetting the increase in China is a 7.0-million-ton reduction for 2015/16 Brazil corn beginning stocks.  Brazil corn feeding is raised for 2006/07 through 2011/12.  (Balance sheet revisions for China and Brazil with a comparison to the October estimates and projections will be available at http://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/historical.htm following today\u2019s WASDE release.)  Global coarse grain production for 2015/16 is raised 2.3 million tons with the largest increase for U.S. corn.  Corn production is also increased for Argentina and Brazil, but lowered for Ukraine, South Africa, India, and EU.  Global sorghum production is lowered slightly with a reduction for Mexico more than offsetting the U.S. increase.  Higher EU barley production is mostly offset by a reduction for Russia.  EU oats and rye production are each raised slightly, but India millet is lowered.Global 2015/16 coarse grain consumption is lowered 10.0 million tons mostly reflecting reductions in China corn and sorghum feeding.  Corn consumption is also lowered for EU with reductions in food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use and feed and residual use, with the latter driven by higher expected wheat feeding.  China FSI use is raised on prospects for more corn processing.  Global coarse grain trade for 2015/16 is lowered with corn and sorghum exports both reduced.  Corn exports are lowered for Ukraine and India, but raised for Argentina.  Brazil corn exports are raised for 2014/15, also affecting U.S. 2015/16 marketing year export prospects. Lower world sorghum exports for 2015/16 reflect this month\u2019s change for the United States.  Sorghum imports are lowered for China with only a small and partly offsetting increase made for Mexico.  Global coarse grain ending stocks for 2015/16 are raised 24.3 million tons with nearly all of the increase for China corn.  More than half of the world\u2019s 2015/16 corn ending stocks are expected to be held in China.  Corn ending stocks outside China are projected 0.3 million tons higher this month.  Higher U.S. and EU corn ending stocks are offset by reductions for Brazil and Indonesia.RICE:  U.S. all rice production in 2015/16 is forecast at 190.8 million cwt, up 3.0 million from last month, with the increase entirely due to a higher yield. The average all rice yield is forecast at 7,423 pounds per acre, up 116 pounds from last month.  Yields are raised for all states except for Texas and Arkansas.  Yields are lowered for Texas and unchanged for Arkansas.  The California all rice yield is raised 600 pounds per acre to 8,600 pounds.  Long-grain and combined medium- and short-grain rice production are both raised from last month, with long-grain production projected at 132.4 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain production at 58.4 million. The all rice import forecast is unchanged at 25.5 million cwt.  All rice domestic and residual use is raised 2.0 million cwt to 127.0 million cwt, 1.0 million each in long-grain and medium- and short-grain rice.  All rice exports are raised 1.0 million cwt to 98.0 million cwt with the increase in long-grain. Long-grain exports are projected at 65.0 million, and medium- and short-grain exports at 33.0 million.  All rice ending stocks are projected at 39.8 million cwt, unchanged from last month with long-grain stocks at 21.8 million, and medium- and short-grain at 16.1 million.The 2015/16 long-grain season-average farm price range is projected at $11.50 to $12.50 per cwt, down $1.30 per cwt on both ends from last month.  The medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.60 to $18.60 per cwt, up 30 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  The California medium- and short-grain rice price at a midpoint of $21.50 per cwt is up $0.50 per cwt from last month.  The Other States medium- and short-grain rice price at a midpoint of $13.00 per cwt is lowered $1.00 per cwt.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $13.30 to $14.30 per cwt, down $0.90 per cwt on each end of the range.  Lower-than-expected prices published by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for August and September, along with price expectations the remainder of the marketing year, support the downward adjustment in rice prices from a month ago.Global 2015/16 ending stocks are raised 2.7 million tons or 3 percent due mostly to an increase in beginning stocks and a decrease in consumption. Beginning stocks for 2015/16 are raised 1.9 million tons due mostly to downward adjustments in 2014/15 consumption for China and India, that consequently raised 2014/15 ending stocks.  Consumption changes in recent years for China and India are based on reports received from the Agricultural Counselor\u2019s offices in each country.  In China, consumption is lowered for both 2014/15 and 2015/16 due to higher prices, inconsistent quality of state rice reserves, and changing consumption patterns. In India, consumption is lowered and ending stocks are raised to better reflect government of India reports on the stocks situation.  Global production for 2015/16 is lowered 0.5 million tons to 473.5 million, primarily due to smaller crops forecast for Bangladesh, Cambodia, and the Philippines, partially offset by increases for Sri Lanka, South Korea, and the United States.  World consumption is projected at 486.2 million tons, down 1.3 million from last month, but still a record.  Consumption is lowered for Cambodia, China, India, and Vietnam.  Trade for 2015/16 is lowered slightly due mostly to smaller exports by Cambodia, and smaller imports by Sri Lanka and Vietnam.  Global ending stocks are forecast at 91.0 million tons, up 2.7 million from last month, but a decrease of 12.7 million tons from the preceding year, and the lowest stocks since 2007/08.  The 2015/16 stocks-to-use ratio at 18.7 percent is the lowest since 2006/07.",
    "November_2014": "COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain production for 2014/15 is lowered this month as lower corn, barley, and oats output more than offsets a small increase for sorghum.  Corn production is forecast 68 million bushels lower, but still a record at 14,407 million bushels.  The national average corn yield is reduced 0.8 bushels per acre to 173.4 bushels.  Small decreases in barley and oats production reflect the resurvey of producers who reported unharvested acreage in early September for the Small Grains report.  Sorghum production is raised 4 million bushels with a higher forecast yield.   U.S. corn use for 2014/15 is projected slightly higher with a 5-million-bushel increase in expected food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use.  Corn used in ethanol production is projected 25 million bushels higher with a reduction in expected sorghum use for ethanol and the strong pace of weekly ethanol production reported so far for the marketing year.  Mostly offsetting this increase is a 20-million-bushel reduction in other food and industrial use.  Projected corn ending stocks are lowered 73 million bushels.  The projected range for the season-average farm corn price is raised 10 cents on each end to $3.20 to $3.80 per bushel.Sorghum exports for 2014/15 are projected 10 million bushels higher on continued strong demand.  Higher sorghum prices, driven by the strong pace of export sales and shipments, reduce the attractiveness of sorghum used in ethanol production and drive this month\u2019s reduction in projected sorghum FSI use.  Sorghum feed and residual use is raised 5 million bushels with the increase in production.  The projected sorghum season-average farm price range is raised 20 cents on each end to $3.15 to $3.75 per bushel.  The projected 2014/15 season-average farm prices for barley and oats are also raised this month based on prices reported to date.Global coarse grain supplies for 2014/15 are projected 1.6 million tons higher as the U.S. reduction is more than offset by higher foreign output.  Foreign corn production is raised 1.4 million tons with increases for EU, Ukraine, and Mexico more than offsetting reductions for China and Kenya.  World mixed grain production is raised 1.3 million tons with an increase for EU on higher reported area and yields, mostly in Poland and Germany.  World barley output is raised 0.6 million tons with increases for EU and Algeria more than offsetting small reductions for Kazakhstan and the United States.  Sorghum production is raised for Mexico, but lowered for Argentina, leaving foreign production up slightly.  Rye production is lowered for EU.  Global coarse grain consumption for 2014/15 is lowered 1.1 million tons.  Corn use is lowered for China, but raised for EU, Ukraine, and Mexico.  Barley feed use is raised for China, but lowered for Ukraine.  Sorghum use is raised for Mexico and China.  Corn imports are lowered for EU, China, and Japan, but raised for Iran and South Korea.  Corn exports are lowered for Argentina and Brazil, but raised for Ukraine.  Barley and sorghum imports are raised for China.  Barley exports are raised for Canada and Ukraine.  World corn ending stocks are projected 0.9 million tons higher with the U.S. reduction more than offset by increases for Mexico, Brazil, Ukraine, China, and Argentina.RICE: All rice supplies for 2014/15 are increased slightly from last month due to an increase in production.  U.S. all rice production is forecast at 221.1 million cwt, up 0.2 percent from last month due to an increase in yield.  Average all rice yield is estimated at 7,597 pounds per acre, up 13 pounds per acre from a month ago.  Harvested area is unchanged at 2.91 million acres.  Long-grain rice production is up 0.2 million cwt to 160.3 million, and combined medium- and short-grain rice production is raised 0.1 million cwt to 60.8 million cwt. On the 2014/15 use side, forecast all rice domestic and residual use and exports are unchanged from a month ago at 131.0 million cwt and 102.0 million, respectively.  However, the rough rice export component is raised 1.0 million cwt to 35.0 million, up 22 percent from the prior year, and the largest since 2009/10.  Conversely, exports of milled rice are lowered 1.0 million (rough-rice basis) to 67.0 million.  Exports of combined medium- and short-grain rice are raised 2.0 million to 34.0 million, up 10 percent from 2013/14.  Exports of medium-grain rice are expected to be larger because of forecast tighter supplies in Australia, and a change in the export policy in Egypt that likely will constrain exports.  Australia and Egypt are two principal medium-grain rice competitors of the United States.  Conversely, long-grain rice exports are lowered 2.0 million cwt to 68.0 million, still up 10 percent from the prior year.  Long-grain milled rice markets in the Middle East and Africa are expected to be very competitive and likely will favor lower-priced rice sourced from Asia.  U.S. long-grain exports will be strong to markets in the Western Hemisphere.  All rice ending stocks are forecast at 40.9 million cwt, up nearly 1 percent from last month, and an increase of nearly 29 percent from 2013/14.The 2014/15 long-grain rice season-average farm price range is projected at $12.20 to $13.20 per cwt, unchanged from last month.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price range is projected at $19.00 to $20.00 per cwt, up $1.30 per cwt on each end of the range.  The all rice season-average farm price is forecast at $14.20 to $15.20 per cwt, up 40 cents per cwt on each end of the range.  Tight supplies of combined medium- and short-grain rice in California along with reduced supplies among the major competitors including Australia and Egypt are expected to support prices.  Conversely, a larger supply of lower priced Southern medium-grain rice will limit the increase in the total medium- and short-grain farm price.Global 2014/15 ending stocks are lowered 5.7 million tons or nearly 5.5 percent due to a decrease in total supplies and an increase in consumption.  Total supplies for 2014/15 are lowered 4.4 million tons due mostly to a reduction in beginning stocks of 4.0 million.  India\u2019s 2013/14 ending stocks are lowered nearly 3.0 million tons due mostly to an increase in consumption.  Lower procurement of rice by the government of India coupled with higher disbursement of rice through the public distribution system drew down government rice stocks in 2013/14.  Additionally, 2013/14 rice ending stocks in Thailand and Vietnam are lowered 0.8 million tons and 0.5 million, respectively.  World 2014/15 rice production is lowered 0.4 million tons to 475.0 million tons due mostly to smaller crops forecast for Australia and Egypt, which are partially offset by an increase for South Korea.  Global 2014/15 rice consumption is raised 1.3 million tons to a record 482.9 million due mostly to increases for India and Vietnam, partially offset by reductions for Egypt and South Korea.  Global rice trade is up 0.4 million tons from a month ago with a 0.8-million-ton increase for Thailand, partially offset by reductions for Australia and Egypt.  Imports are increased for EU and China.  The decline in global ending stocks is due mostly to reductions for India, Thailand, and Vietnam, partially offset by increases for China, Egypt, EU, and South Korea.  Global 2014/15 ending stocks at 98.6 million tons are down nearly 8 million tons from 2013/14 and the lowest stocks since 2009/10.  Stocks among the major foreign exporters are down 18 percent from 2013/14.",
    "June_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  The 2017/18 outlook for U.S. feed grain supplies is virtually unchanged this month as an increase in sorghum beginning stocks is largely offset by reductions for barley and oats.  Projected corn production for 2017/18 is unchanged at 14,065 million bushels.  USDA will release the Acreage report on June 30, providing a survey-based estimate of corn area planted and a forecast of area harvested for grain.  The season-average corn price received by producers is unchanged from last month at $3.00 to $3.80 per bushel.The increase for 2017/18 sorghum beginning stocks reflects a 5 million bushel reduction for 2016/17 food, seed, and industrial use based on reported sorghum used for ethanol production through April in the Grain Crushings and Co-Products Production report.  With other use categories unchanged, sorghum ending stocks for 2016/17 are raised 5 million bushels.   This month\u2019s 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, increased trade and reduced stocks relative to last month.  EU corn production is down based on government data indicating lower-than-expected area in France and Germany.  Canada corn production is lowered on reductions to both area and yield, as wetter-than-normal conditions in Ontario and Quebec during May delayed plantings and are expected to reduce yield prospects.  Ukraine corn production is raised based on reported planting progress to date indicating a level of planted area above previous expectations.  Turkey\u2019s barley production is raised as the impact of April dryness was not as severe as previously anticipated.  For 2016/17, Brazil corn production is raised as above-normal rainfall in the Center-West during May boosts yield prospects.  South Africa corn production is higher reflecting the latest production estimate from the government. Major global trade changes for 2017/18 include higher projected corn exports for Ukraine and Russia, with increased corn imports for the EU.  Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month, with reductions for Canada, the EU and Russia more than offsetting increases for South Africa and Ukraine.   RICE:  U.S. 2016/17 rice ending stocks are lowered 2.0 million cwt this month on increased exports.  Milled exports for 2016/17 are raised 4.0 million cwt on strong demand particularly in the Middle East.  However, rough exports for 2016/17 are lowered 2.0 million cwt on a correction in Census data for shipments to El Salvador; the correction also led to a slight reduction in 2015/16 rough exports.  Total supplies for 2017/18 are down 2.0 million cwt, reflecting the lower beginning stocks and unchanged production.  All rice planted area remains estimated at 2.6 million acres despite weather-related uncertainties in the mid-South and California during planting this spring.  NASS will release the Acreage report on June 30 providing an estimate for rice planted area and a forecast for harvested area.  Total exports are raised 2.0 million cwt to 112.0 million with milled increased 3.0 million and rough reduced 1.0 million.  Ending stocks are lowered 4.0 million cwt to 34.1 million, and the 2017/18 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.30 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.00 to $12.00.  Global supplies are raised fractionally for both 2016/17 and 2017/18.  The largest change is a 1.5-million-ton increase in 2016/17 India production to 108.0 million on updated government statistics.  Global 2017/18 rice production is lowered fractionally to 481.0 million tons, down 2.1 million tons from the previous year and the second largest on record.  Exports are raised 0.6 million tons in 2016/17 and 0.5 million tons in 2017/18 both largely on increases for India.  Imports for 2017/18 are raised 0.4 million tons for Bangladesh on tight supplies.  Only slight changes are made this month to total use.  Ending stocks are raised 0.7 million tons for 2016/17 and 0.8 million tons for 2017/18, respectively.  ",
    "July_2017": "COARSE GRAINS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. corn outlook is for larger supplies, greater feed and residual use, and higher ending stocks.  Corn beginning stocks are raised 75 million bushels reflecting lower feed and residual use in 2016/17 based on indicated disappearance during the first three quarters of the marketing year in the June 30 Grain Stocks report.  Corn production for 2017/18 is projected 190 million bushels higher based on increased planted and harvested areas from the June 30 Acreage report.  The national average corn yield is unchanged at 170.7 bushels per acre.  During June, harvested-area weighted precipitation for the major corn producing states was below normal but did not represent an extreme deviation from average (See Westcott and Jewison, Weather Effects on Expected Corn and Soybean Yields, USDA-ERS, FDS-13g-01, July 2013).  For much of the crop the critical pollination period will be during middle and late July. Projected feed and residual use for 2017/18 is raised 50 million bushels on a larger crop and lower expected prices.  With other use categories unchanged, corn ending stocks are raised 215 million bushels from last month.  Small revisions are made to historical trade and utilization estimates based on the 13th month trade data revisions from the Census Bureau.  The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint for a range of $2.90 to $3.70 per bushel with the larger carryout.Oat production is lowered 13 million bushels and barley production is reduced 16 million reflecting area adjustments in the Acreage report and higher barley and lower oat yields in today\u2019s Crop Production.  Sorghum production is raised based on the higher area reported in the Acreage report.This month\u2019s 2017/18 foreign coarse grain outlook is for higher production, reduced trade and increased stocks relative to last month.  EU corn production is down reflecting a lower projection for Spain, where heat and dryness during grain fill hurt yield prospects.  Historical revisions are made to Kenya\u2019s corn production estimates to better reflect statistics published by the government.  Barley production is lowered for Argentina, the EU, and Ukraine, but raised for Turkey and Russia.  For 2016/17, Argentina corn production is raised based on the latest information indicating a higher-than-expected level of area.  Major global trade changes for 2017/18 include lower barley exports for Argentina and reduced corn exports for the EU and Tanzania.  Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month, with the largest increases primarily for Vietnam, Mexico, and Argentina.   RICE: U.S. 2017/18 all rice supplies are lowered 9.5 million cwt to 261.6 million on a production decrease, which is partially offset by slightly higher imports.  Long-grain production is lowered 5.6 million cwt and combined medium- short-grain production is lowered 4.1 million cwt.  The production decrease stems from a 123,000 acre reduction in harvested area, reflecting the floods that occurred in Northeast Arkansas and the bootheel of Missouri as well as excessive moisture in California at planting time.  Long-grain beginning stocks are raised 3.8 million cwt on a 2.0-million-cwt decrease in both 2016/17 exports and domestic and residual use, which is partially offset by a 0.2-million-cwt decrease in 2016/17 imports.  These revisions are offset by changes to medium- and short-grain leaving all rice 2016/17 ending stocks and total use unchanged.  Total use for 2017/18 is reduced 8.0 million cwt with reductions to both domestic and residual use and exports leaving 2017/18 ending stocks down 1.5 million.  By class, long-grain ending stocks are raised 1.2 million cwt and medium- and short-grain ending stocks are lowered 2.7 million.  The 2017/18 all rice season-average farm price is raised $0.80 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.80 to $12.80.  Global rice supplies for 2017/18 are raised 1.9 million tons primarily on increased production for India and Thailand.  India production is raised 2.0 million tons to 108.0 million, and Thailand production is raised 0.9 million tons to 20.4 million, both changes are on improved rainfall thus far in the growing season.  The largest production decrease was a 0.3-million-ton reduction for the United States.  Foreign exports are raised 0.6 million tons led by increases for India and China.  Global use is reduced fractionally and world ending stocks are raised 2.0 million tons to 122.5 million.  "
