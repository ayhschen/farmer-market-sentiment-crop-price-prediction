    "November_2019": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean outlook is for slightly lower production, reduced crush, and higher ending stocks.  Soybean production is forecast at 3.55 billion bushels, down less than 1 million on fractionally lower yields and unchanged harvested area.  Soybean crush is reduced 15 million bushels to 2.11 billion on lower-than expected early-season crush and reduced soybean meal export prospects.  With reduced crush, soybean ending stocks are projected at 475 million bushels, up 15 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $9.00 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price forecast is also unchanged at $325.00 per short ton.  The soybean oil price is forecast at $0.31 per pound, up $0.01 from last month on sharply higher reported prices through October.The foreign oilseed supply and demand forecasts for 2019/20 include lower production, crush, and stocks, compared with last month.  Foreign production is forecast at 463.6 million tons, down 3.4 million on lower soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, and rapeseed production.  Soybean production for India is reduced 2.0 million tons to 9.0 million on lower yields resulting from excessive late-season rainfall.  Soybean production is also reduced for Canada on lower yields.  Other production changes include lower sunflowerseed production for Argentina and lower rapeseed production for Australia and the European Union.  Foreign soybean crush changes for 2019/20 include reductions for India, China, and Canada.  Foreign soybean ending stocks for 2019/20 are reduced with lower projections for Argentina, Canada, and India only partly offset with higher forecasts for Brazil and Egypt. SUGAR:  Estimates of U.S. sugar supply and use for 2018/19 are revised on complete fiscal year Sweetener Market Data (SMD) and trade data through September from U.S. Census and FAS.  Beet sugar production is increased 29,680 short tons, raw value (STRV) and Louisiana cane sugar production is increased 29,015 STRV, both on higher-than-expected production in September 2019.  Deliveries for human consumption are estimated at 12.106 million STRV, a reduction of 19,347 from last month.  Delivery growth of 0.5 percent over the previous year results from a relatively large increase in direct consumption imports.  Combined domestic beet and cane sugar processors\u2019 deliveries have remained flat since 2016/17.  Ending stocks are estimated at 1.779 million STRV implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.5 percent and adding 54,105 STRV to 2019/20 beginning stocks over last month.Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 4.588 million STRV, a reduction of 466,485 due to poor harvest conditions resulting in lower sugarbeet production. Beet processors reduced their sliced sugarbeets projection in SMD by 10.3 percent to 28.442 million tons. The largest reductions are centered in the Red River Valley. Louisiana cane sugar production is reduced by 105,803 STRV to 1.794 million based on a lower NASS sugarcane yield forecast and processors\u2019 lower recovery rate. Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 25,000 STRV to 12.125 million in line with the reduction for 2018/19. Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.285 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 10.5 percent.  Estimates of Mexico sugar supply and use for 2018/19 are revised on complete fiscal year data published by CONADESUCA and U.S. Census.  Sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.772 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 293,320 MT from last month.  The projection matches the first published CONADESUCA survey of most, if not all, sugar mills in Mexico.  Although area harvested is up 0.64 percent, sugarcane yield is down 10.95 percent from last year to 63.17 MT/hectare.  Drought has severely reduced yields in the Northeast and Gulf of Mexico production regions.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are projected down 142,587 MT from last month to 4.057 million.  This is 35,316 MT lower than the estimate for 2018/19 and reportedly attributable to a continuing trend of food manufacturers reformulating the sugar content in products.  The FAS Mexico Post also notes the effects of negative health campaigns, increased use of high fructose corn syrup in food and beverage products, and government taxes on sugar-containing products.  Ending stocks are forecast at 935,751 MT, a sufficient amount to cover delivery needs before the start of the 2020/21 campaign.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are residually forecast at 641,329 MT. Exports to the United States are unchanged from last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2019 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month on higher beef, pork, broiler, and turkey production.  Beef production is raised from the previous month on higher expected slaughter of both fed and non-fed cattle.  The pork production forecast is raised on both higher hog slaughter and slightly higher carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is raised as hatchery data points to larger supplies of birds available for slaughter in the fourth quarter.  Turkey production is raised on higher-than-expected third-quarter production and higher expected supplies of birds in the fourth quarter.  Egg production is reduced on lower reported hatching egg production in the third quarter which more than offsets higher-than-expected table egg production.  However, no change is made to the fourth-quarter production forecast. For 2020, the total red meat and poultry forecast is increased from last month as higher broiler and turkey production more than offsets a lower beef production forecast.  The pork production forecast is unchanged.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are raised as the increase in production late this year is forecast to carry into late 2020.  The beef production forecast is reduced on a slower expected pace of gains in carcass weights.  A slightly slower pace of feedlot marketings also contributes to the reduced production forecast.  The 2020 egg production forecast is unchanged from the previous month.Beef and pork trade for 2019 are adjusted to reflect third-quarter reported data; the forecasts for the fourth-quarter 2019 and for 2020 are unchanged from last month.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is lowered as weaker-than-expected third quarter exports further dampen expectations for shipments in the fourth quarter; no change is made to the 2020 forecast.  Turkey export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are unchanged.       The cattle price forecast is raised for fourth-quarter 2019 based on recent data; no change is made to the 2020 forecast.  The 2019 and 2020 hog price forecasts are reduced on current price weakness.  The 2019 broiler price forecast is raised from the previous month on current prices.  The price strength is carried into early 2020, but increased production in the later part of 2020 is expected to pressure prices; the 2020 annual price forecast is unchanged.  The 2019 and 2020 turkey price forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  The egg price forecast for 2019 is increased on current price strength, but the 2020 forecast is unchanged.The milk production forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised from the previous month as stronger growth in milk per cow more than offsets a slower expected recovery in the cow inventory.  The 2019 fat basis import forecast is raised on recent trade data; the 2020 import forecast is unchanged.  The fat basis export forecast for 2020 is lowered as higher domestic cheese prices are expected to affect the competitiveness of U.S. cheese in international markets.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2019 is reduced on lower imports of milk protein products.  The 2020 forecast is unchanged.  The 2019 skim-solids basis export forecast is raised on stronger sales of nonfat/skim milk powder (NDM/SMP).  The 2020 forecast is unchanged as weak exports of cheese and whey products offset higher expected NDM/SMP sales. Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts for both 2019 and 2020 are raised from last month on strength in demand.  For both 2019 and 2020, butter and whey prices are lowered on current price weakness which is expected to carry into 2020.  The 2019 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised as the higher cheese price more than offsets the lower whey price.  The 2019 Class IV price is raised as the higher NDM price more than offsets a weaker butter price, but for 2020, the lower butter price outweighs the higher NDM price and the Class IV price is reduced.  The 2019 all milk price forecast is raised to $18.60 per cwt; the 2020 all milk price is forecast unchanged at $18.85 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. cotton estimates include lower production and ending stocks due to a smaller crop in the Southwest.  While the U.S. production forecast is reduced 4 percent, to 20.8 million bales, domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  U.S. ending stocks are now 900,000 bales lower at 6.1 million but, at 31 percent, are still forecast at their highest share of use since 2008/09.  The marketing-year average price received by upland producers is forecast at 61 cents per pound, 5 percent (3 cents) above the October forecast, but 13 percent lower than the final 2018/19 price of 70.3 cents.This month\u2019s 2019/20 world cotton forecasts include lower production, lower ending stocks and higher world trade.  World production is reduced nearly 3.0 million bales, with reductions occurring primarily in the United States, Pakistan, India, and China. There are also smaller declines in the production estimates for Turkey and Turkmenistan.  World trade is forecast 1.1 million bales higher, with higher imports by Turkey, Pakistan, and India more than offsetting a 200,000-bale decline in Indonesia.  Higher exports are projected from Brazil, Malaysia, Benin, Greece, India, and several smaller countries. With little change from the previous month in beginning stocks or consumption, world 2019/20 cotton ending stocks are projected nearly 3.0 million bales lower this month.  At 80.8 million bales, world ending stocks in 2019/20 are forecast nearly unchanged from 2018/19. ",
    "September_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 124.3 million tons, up 4.1 million from last month with higher soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production.  Soybean production is projected at a record 4,201 million bushels, up 141 million due to a higher yield forecast.  Soybean supplies are raised with higher production more than offsetting lower beginning stocks.  Despite higher crush and exports, 2016/17 soybean ending stocks are projected at 365 million bushels, up 35 million from last month due to higher supplies.Changes for 2015/16 include higher exports and lower ending stocks.  Exports are increased 60 million to a record 1,940 million bushels based on official trade through July and indications from record high August export inspections.  Ending stocks are projected at 195 million bushels, down 60 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.30 to $9.80 per bushel, down 5 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are also projected lower at $300 to $340 per short ton, down 5 dollars on both ends of the range.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 30.5 to 35.5 cents per pound, up 1 cent on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 544.5 million tons, up 1.0 million from last month.  A reduction for rapeseed is offset with gains for soybeans, sunflowerseed, peanuts, and cottonseed.  Lower soybean production forecasts for Brazil, India, and Canada are more than offset by higher production for the United States and China.  Brazil soybean production is reduced on lower area as relatively strong corn prices in southern Brazil are expected to increase first-crop corn planting.  Projected soybean production is reduced for India on lower area and yields.  Lower yields reflect excessive rainfall throughout the major producing region for July and August.  Soybean production is reduced for Canada on lower yields as reported by Statistics Canada.  China soybean production is raised as a higher area forecast more than offsets a lower yield.  Global rapeseed production is reduced slightly with reduced forecasts for the EU and Russia partly offset by an increase for Canada.  The 2016/17 Canada rapeseed crop is raised with both area and yield adjusted in line with the final estimates for the 2015/16 crop recently issued by Statistics Canada.   Other changes include increased peanut production for India and increased sunflowerseed production for Argentina.Global oilseed trade for 2016/17 is reduced this month mainly reflecting reduced soybean imports for China and reduced soybean exports for Brazil and Canada.  Rapeseed and sunflowerseed imports are increased for the EU partly offsetting lower rapeseed production.  Global oilseed stocks for 2016/17 are projected slightly higher this month mainly reflecting the sharp increase in ending stocks of rapeseed in Canada and increased soybean stocks for the United States.  SUGAR:  Sugar production for the fiscal year 2016/17 is increased 63,904 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 9.272 million resulting from new sugar crop forecasts made by NASS in the September Crop Production report.  Cane sugar production in Florida is increased by 95,536 STRV based on a higher sugar per acre implied by NASS\u2019s Florida sugarcane yield forecast increase from last month of 2.0 tons/acre to 41.2 tons/acre.  Partially offsetting is a beet sugar production decline of 31,632 STRV based on a lower sugar per acre implied by NASS\u2019s sugarbeet yield forecast decrease of 0.1 tons/acre to 31.3 and an area harvested reduction of 3,000 acres. Beginning stocks for 2016/17 are increased by 70,951 STRV due to changes made to 2015/16 total supply that flowed into the ending stock estimate.  The estimate of 2015/16 beet sugar production is increased by 75,951 STRV, primarily based on a lower sugarbeet pile shrink factor implied by Sweetener Market Data (SMD) than was forecast by processors in previous months.  Imports for 2015/16 are reduced by 5,000 STRV based on a reduction of 30,000 from Mexico that is partially offset by a pace-to-date increase of 25,000 for re-export imports.  The reduction for Mexico reflects the entry of half of the 60,000 STRV of the expanded export access made in May by the Commerce Department at USDA\u2019s request.Imports for 2016/17 are reduced by 366,000 STRV to 2.652 million.  All of the reduction is attributable to a decrease in imports from Mexico for 2016/17.  Total use for 2016/17 is unchanged from last month.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.656 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Beginning stocks for 2016/17 in Mexico are increased by 25,675 metric tons (MT) reflecting the reduction in 2015/16 exports to the United States.  Exports for 2016/17 to the United States are projected to decrease from last month by 313,236 MT to 860,199, based on changes made in this month\u2019s WASDE projections for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.248 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 223,963 MT.Beginning stocks for 2016/17 in Mexico are increased by 25,675 metric tons (MT) reflecting the reduction in 2015/16 exports to the United States.  Exports for 2016/17 to the United States are projected to decrease from last month by 313,236 MT to 860,199, based on changes made in this month\u2019s WASDE projections for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.248 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 223,963 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total red meat and poultry production for 2016 is reduced from last month as beef, pork, and broiler production forecasts are lowered.  Turkey production is raised.  Beef production is forecast lower on lower expected third quarter steer and heifer slaughter.  Pork production for 2016 is lowered on expectations of slightly lower carcass weights for the third quarter.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 30, providing an indication of producer farrowing intentions into early 2017.  Broiler production is lowered on slower expected growth in the second half of the year.  Bird weights have been lower than previously expected.  Turkey production for second-half 2016 is raised on production and hatchery data.  No changes are made to the 2017 production forecasts for red meat or turkey, but the production forecast for broilers was reduced.  No changes are made to the egg production forecasts for 2016 or 2017. Beef import forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are unchanged.  Beef exports for 2016 are raised on improving trade prospects in a number of countries, but the forecast is unchanged for 2017.  The pork export forecast for 2016 is lowered.  Broiler and turkey exports are lowered for 2016 and 2017 as the recovery in exports remains slower than expected.    Cattle, hog, and broiler prices for second-half 2016 are reduced from last month as relatively weak prices are expected through the remainder of the year.  The turkey price is raised on current price strength.  The cattle price for 2017 is lowered and a small reduction is made to the first-quarter 2017 hog price.  Poultry prices are unchanged from last month.  Egg prices are lowered for 2017.The milk production forecast for 2016 is raised from last month as the cow inventory appears to have steadied in the face of expected improvements in returns.  The production forecast for 2017 is raised to reflect slightly more rapid growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis exports are raised for 2016 and 2017.  For 2016, cheese and cream exports have remained firm, and strength in whole milk powder (WMP) exports is expected to carry into 2017.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised on higher WMP and whey sales.  Both fat and skim-solids basis ending stocks for 2016 are forecast higher as butter and cheese stocks remain high; fat basis ending stocks are raised for 2017 as well.Cheese and butter prices are lowered for 2016 and 2017 as supplies remain high, but prices for nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey are forecast higher as the global supply tightens and demand strengthens.  The Class III price is lowered for 2016 and 2017 as the reduction in the cheese price more than offsets the whey price increase.  The Class IV price is lowered for 2016 as the lower butter price more than offsets the higher NDM price but is raised for 2017 as higher NDM prices more than offset the lower butter price forecast.  The all milk price is forecast lower at $16.10 to $16.30 per cwt for 2016 but is unchanged from last month at $16.15 to $17.15 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  The 2016/17 U.S. cotton estimates include larger production and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is raised 263,000 bales, as increases for the Southwest and California are partially offset by reductions for the Southeast.  Beginning stocks are revised 100,000 bales lower based on indicated stocks as of July 31, 2016, while domestic mill use is reduced slightly in both 2015/16 and 2016/17 based on recent activity.  The export forecast is unchanged.  Ending stocks are now projected at 4.9 million bales, or 33 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the marketing year average farm price is unchanged at 57 to 69 cents per pound. With larger 2016/17 world cotton production mostly offset by lower beginning stocks, world ending stocks are raised only marginally this month.  Beginning stocks are reduced for Brazil, the United States, China, and others due to revisions in the 2015/16 estimates.  Production is raised for several countries, including Australia, the United States, Pakistan, Turkey, Burkina Faso, and Mali, but is lowered for India, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.  Global consumption is virtually unchanged and trade is revised down marginally.  World ending stocks are projected at 89.8 million bales.  ",
    "September_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 132.8 million tons, up 1.9 million from last month with higher soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production forecasts.  Soybean production is projected at a record 4,431 million bushels, up 50 million on a higher yield forecast.  Soybean supplies are raised with higher production only partly offset by lower beginning stocks.  With increased supplies and lower prices, soybean exports are raised to 2,250 million bushels leaving ending stocks unchanged.Soybean oil balance sheet changes for 2017/18 include reduced beginning stocks and supplies and higher use for biodiesel production reflecting recently imposed duties for imported biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia.  Despite reduced forecasts for other domestic use and exports, ending stocks are projected lower.The 2017/18 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.35 to $10.05 per bushel, down $0.10 at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are also lower at $290 to $330 per short ton while soybean oil prices are projected higher at 32.5 to 36.5 cents per pound.  Rising soybean oil prices relative to soybean meal reflects additional demand as increased use of domestic biodiesel feedstock partly offsets reduced biodiesel imports in 2018.Changes for 2016/17 include higher exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Exports are increased 20 million to 2,170 million bushels based on official trade data through July and indications from August export inspections.  With crush raised 5 million bushels, ending stocks are projected at 345 million bushels, down 25 million from last month.The 2017/18 foreign oilseed production is projected at 445.8 million tons, nearly unchanged from last month.  Reductions for soybeans and rapeseed are offset with gains for cottonseed and sunflowerseed.  Lower soybean production for Uruguay and Serbia is partly offset by higher production for Bolivia.  Canola production is reduced for Canada on lower reported area and cottonseed is raised for India based on the latest government planting data.  Foreign sunflowerseed production is slightly higher as larger projected crops for Argentina, Turkey, and the EU more than offset lower projections for Ukraine and Bolivia. Foreign oilseed exports for 2017/18 are reduced this month mainly on lower soybean shipments for Uruguay.  Soybean imports are raised for China and Thailand reflecting higher U.S. exports.  Foreign oilseed stocks for 2017/18 are projected higher as a 1.5-million-ton reduction for Brazilian soybean stocks due to a lower carryin is offset by increased soybean stocks for China, Bolivia, and Argentina, and larger canola stocks in Canada.  Canola stocks in Canada are adjusted with the final 2016/17 crop and stocks estimates recently issued by Statistics Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for the 2017/18 August-July crop year is unchanged from last month at 5.131 short tons, raw value (STRV).  Fiscal year 2017/18 beet sugar is decreased by 51,057 to 5.017 million STRV based on an increase in the proportion of beet sugar expected to be produced in August and September resulting from early harvest activity in the Red River Valley and Michigan.  Beet sugar production for 2016/17 is unchanged at 4.998 million STRV as the increase in expected production for August and September is offset by lower than expected production in July.  Cane sugar production in Texas for 2017/18 is increased 10,000 STRV from last month to 160,000 on the basis of increased sugarcane yield.Sugar imported from Mexico for 2016/17 is projected to be 50,000 STRV lower than last month\u2019s forecast.  Mexico is not expected to ship all of the Commerce Department\u2019s increase in the 2016/17 Export Limit.  Re-export imports for 2016/17 are increased by 35,000 STRV based on the pace to date.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2016/17 are reduced by 100,000 STRV based on an expected reduction in cane sugar deliveries from refineries affected by hurricanes through shutdowns and resulting logistical complications.  Because these difficulties are temporary in nature, corresponding deliveries for 2017/18 are increased by 100,000 STRV.Mexico 2016/17 sugar exports are decreased by 42,792 metric tons (MT) based on fewer shipments to the United States and imports for consumption are increased by 6,500 MT based on the pace to date.  These changes combine to increase ending year stocks by 49,292 MT.  Production, imports, and deliveries for 2017/18 are unchanged from last month.  For 2017/18, exports to the United States are projected at 1.516 million MT, an increase corresponding to increased beginning stocks but still constrained by available domestic supplies.  Exports to the United States are calculated as the lower of the following: (1) anticipated U.S. Needs of 1.551 million MT as defined in the Suspension Agreements; or (2) the export level that yields an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 18.0 percent.  The 18-percent stocks-to-consumption ratio is an assumed lower bound necessary for use until the new Mexico sugarcane harvest is well underway.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2017 is reduced from last month as decreases in commercial beef and broiler production more than offset increases in pork and turkey production.  Second-half beef production forecasts are reduced, reflecting a slower expected marketing pace for fed cattle although cow slaughter is higher.  The third and fourth quarter broiler production forecasts are reduced on hatchery data and the current pace of slaughter.  The 2017 pork production forecast is raised on higher expected carcass weights.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 28, providing an indication of producer farrowing intentions into early 2018.  Third-quarter turkey production forecast is raised slightly, but no changes are made to the outlying quarter.  The annual egg production forecast is increased, reflecting second-quarter production data.  For 2018, the beef production forecast is lowered from the previous month as a slower rate of placements during the second-half of 2017 is expected to result in reduced steer and heifer slaughter in the first half of 2018.  Annual pork production is reduced slightly from the previous month while poultry and egg production forecasts for 2018 are unchanged.  No changes are made to 2017 and 2018 red meat, poultry, or egg trade forecasts. Cattle prices are reduced from last month for the remainder of 2017 and into early 2018 on current price weakness.  The hog price forecast for 2017 is lowered, but the 2018 price forecast remains unchanged.  The annual broiler price forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged.  The turkey price forecast is reduced for 2017 as slightly higher third-quarter turkey prices are more than offset by expected declines in the fourth quarter; the 2018 forecast is unchanged.  The egg price forecast for 2017 is raised on recent price strength, but no change is made to the 2018 price forecast.  The milk production forecast for 2017 is raised as increases in milk per cow more than offset a slower rate of milk cow expansion.  For 2017, fat basis exports are reduced from the previous month on slowing cheese shipments, while fat basis imports are raised on increased purchases of butterfat.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecast for 2017 is lowered on weaker than expected skim milk powder sales, while the import forecast is raised due to stronger demand for a number of dairy products.  For 2018, the milk production forecast is reduced from the previous month on slower growth in cow inventories.  The annual fat basis export forecast is unchanged from the previous month, but the import forecast is reduced on expected declining cheese imports.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is reduced from the previous month as competition in international powder markets is expected to remain strong; imports are reduced on lower milk protein and cheese shipments. Butter, NDM, and whey prices are forecast lower for 2017 while cheese prices are forecast higher from the previous month.  The 2017 Class III price is raised as higher forecast cheese prices offset lower whey prices.  The Class IV price is reduced on lower butter and NDM. For 2018, all dairy product prices are reduced, resulting in lower Class III and Class IV product prices.  The all milk price is reduced to $17.70 to $17.90 per cwt for 2017 and $17.75 to $18.55 per cwt for 2018.COTTON:  The 2017/18 U.S. cotton estimates include larger production, exports, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is raised 1.2 million bales, with notable increases in the Southwest and Delta.  Both harvested and planted area are raised, with abandonment slightly higher this month.  Beginning stocks are revised 50,000 bales lower based on indicated stocks as of July 31, 2017, exports are raised 700,000 bales, while domestic use is unchanged.  Ending stocks are forecast 200,000 bales higher than the month before, at 6.0 million, or 33 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the marketing year average farm price is reduced 1 cent on each end, giving a range of 54 to 66 cents per pound.With slightly lower 2017/18 world beginning stocks and slightly higher consumption only partially offsetting a 3.4-million-bale increase in production, world ending stocks are raised 2.4 million bales this month.  Beginning stocks are reduced for India and Australia, offsetting an increase for Brazil.  Production is raised for several countries, led by the United States and India.  Larger production is also forecast this month for Brazil, Australia, Mexico, and Turkey.  World trade is revised upwards by 600,000 bales. World ending stocks are projected at 92.5 million bales, 3.0 million above their 2016/17 level, but unchanged from a year earlier as a share of consumption.",
    "November_2018": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean outlook is for lower production, reduced exports, and increased ending stocks.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,600 million bushels, down 90 million on lower yields.  The soybean yield is projected at 52.1 bushels per acre, down 1.0 bushel mainly on reductions for Iowa and Illinois.  Soybean exports are reduced 160 million bushels to 1,900 million with lower imports projected for China.  The forecast protein consumption growth rate for China is reduced, which is reflected in the limited number of U.S. export sales this fall.  Although sales to China are minimal, strong sales to other markets are expected to continue, which is likely to result in a larger share of U.S. exports in the second half of the marketing year.  With lower exports and slightly higher crush, soybean ending stocks are projected at 955 million bushels, up 70 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price range is forecast at $7.60 to $9.60 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean meal and soybean oil price forecasts are also unchanged at $290 to $330 per short ton and 28.0 to 32.0 cents per pound, respectively.The 2018/19 global oilseed outlook includes lower production, exports, and increased stocks compared to last month.  Lower production of soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, and rapeseed is partly offset with a higher forecast for sunflowerseed.  Reduced global peanut and rapeseed production is largely driven by historical revisions issued by China\u2019s NBS.  Global soybean production is reduced 2.0 million tons with lower production for the United States and Argentina partly offset by increases for China, India, and Ukraine.Global soybean exports are reduced 2.0 million tons to 155.4 million.  Lower U.S. exports are partly offset by a 2-million-ton increase for Brazil and higher shipments out of Ukraine and Russia.  With limited U.S. commitments to China so far this marketing year, China\u2019s soybean imports are lowered 4 million tons to 90 million.  China\u2019s crush is also lowered, but protein meal consumption growth is expected to remain positive with support from available foreign exportable supplies.  South America is expected to capture more of China\u2019s soybean market while the United States is likely to capture more market share in the rest of the world, particularly in the second half of the marketing year when those imports typically trend higher.Global oilseed stocks are up 2.4 million tons to 126.2 million mainly on higher stocks of soybeans and sunflowerseed.  Global soybean stocks are up 2.0 million tons to 112.1 million, with higher stocks in Argentina, India, and the United States that are partly offset by lower stocks in China and Brazil.SUGAR:  Changes to U.S. sugar supply and use for 2017/18 are made based on full year data from the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Sweetener Market Data and U.S. Census trade data.  Sugar production is increased 44,294 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 9.293 million based on stronger-than-expected production in the month of September for both beet sugar and Louisiana cane sugar. Imports are reduced by 38,139 STRV on lower-than-expected shipments from Mexico that are partially offset by an increase in high-tier tariff imports.  Total deliveries are reduced by 69,569 STRV, reflecting decreases for human consumption, product re-exports, and non-human uses.  U.S. beet sugar production for 2018/19 is reduced by 261,953 STRV to 4.974 million based on a 4.9-percent reduction in the NASS forecast of sugarbeet production in the November Crop Production Report.  Louisiana cane sugar production is increased by 14,945 STRV to 1.841 million, based on a higher NASS forecast of sugarcane production partially offset by lower sucrose recovery forecast by processors.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 75,000 STRV to 12.175 million in line with the reduction for 2017/18.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 1.404 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 11.3 percent.Mexico sugar exports for 2017/18 are estimated at 1.099 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 48,345 from last month.  Exports are comprised of 1.047 million MT to the United States under export licenses and of combined exports of 51,985 MT to non-U.S. destinations and to the U.S. re-export import program.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 108,397 MT to 4.228 million reflecting full-year CONADESUCA reporting.  Partially offsetting are deliveries to IMMEX totaling 481,594 MT for the year, an increase of 91,594.  Ending stocks are estimated at 1.394 million MT of which 297,157 are required to be exported in 2018/19 before December 31 per provisions administered by the Fideicomiso Maestro para la Exportaci\u00f3n de Excedentes de los Ingenios (FIMAE).  Mexico sugar exports for 2018/19 are projected to decrease 53,201 MT reflecting lower inventories held under FIMAE provisions than reported last month by CONADESUCA.  In line with 2017/18 changes, deliveries for human consumption for 2018/19 are decreased to 4.413 million MT and deliveries for IMMEX are increased to 480,000 MT.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.613 million MT, implying a high stocks-to-consumption ratio of 36.3 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2018 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower beef, pork, and turkey production more than offsets higher broiler production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month on a slower expected marketing pace for fed cattle in the fourth quarter.  The pork production forecast is reduced on lower expected fourth-quarter hog slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is raised as higher reported third-quarter slaughter more than offsets small declines in fourth-quarter production.  The turkey production forecast is reduced on third-quarter slaughter data; no change is made to the outlying quarter.  The 2018 egg production forecast is unchanged from last month. For 2019, the total red meat and poultry forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower expected beef, pork, and turkey production.  Beef production is reduced on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter in the first half of 2019.  Pork production is reduced on lower expected first-quarter hog slaughter and slightly lighter carcass weights.  Turkey production is lowered as the sector continues to adjust to relatively weak prices.  The 2019 egg and broiler production forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.Beef import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from the previous month on decreased shipments of processing beef from Australia.  Beef export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised from the previous month on continued firm global demand for U.S. beef.  The 2018 pork import and export forecasts are reduced fractionally on third-quarter trade data.  The 2018 broiler import and export forecasts are raised on recent trade data.  The 2018 turkey export forecast is reduced on slow global demand.  No change is made to the 2019 turkey export forecast.        Cattle and hog price forecasts are raised for 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.  The 2018 broiler price forecast is raised from the previous month on current prices, but no change is made to the 2019 price forecast.  The 2018 turkey price forecast is lowered from last month, but no change is made to 2019 forecast.  The 2018 and 2019 egg price forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. The milk production forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from the previous month on lower cow numbers; however, stronger growth in milk per cow is expected to partially offset smaller dairy cow numbers.  The 2018 fat basis import forecast is unchanged from the previous month, but is reduced for 2019 on lower imports of milk protein concentrates.  Fat basis export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from last month.  The skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced primarily on lower expected imports of milk protein concentrates and casein.  The 2018 and 2019 skim-solids basis export forecasts are unchanged. For 2018, the cheese and butter price forecasts are lowered from last month on recent price weakness, but the nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecast is unchanged.  The whey price forecast is raised from the previous month.  For 2019, cheese and butter price forecasts are lowered from the previous month, but NDM and whey price forecasts are raised.  The 2018 and 2019 Class III price forecasts are lowered from the last month on lower cheese prices.  The 2018 and 2019 Class IV prices are reduced from last month on lower forecast butter prices.  The 2018 all milk price forecast is lowered to $16.20 to $16.30 per cwt and the 2019 all milk price is forecast lower at $16.70 to $17.60 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. balance sheet shows lower production, consumption, exports, and ending stocks.  Production is reduced 1.35 million bales due mainly to decreases in the Southeast, reflecting the impact of adverse weather.  Domestic mill use is reduced 100,000 bales and exports are reduced 500,000 bales.  Projected ending stocks in 2018/19 are 700,000 bales lower this month, at 4.3 million bales or 24 percent of use.  The marketing-year-average price received by producers is forecast between 71.0 and 77.0 cents per pound, with a midpoint of 74.0 cents, 1 cent above last month.This month\u2019s 2018/19 world supply and demand forecasts include lower beginning stocks, production, consumption, trade, and ending stocks.  Historical revisions to Benin\u2019s exports resulted in a 375,000-bale decrease in 2018/19 beginning stocks there, accounting for much of this month\u2019s 500,000-bale decline in global beginning stocks. Forecast global production is reduced 2.3 million bales as smaller expected crops in the United States, India, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan offset an increase in Benin. Consumption is reduced 875,000 bales, with smaller expected mill use in India, Pakistan, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States.  Global ending stocks are 1.8 million bales lower this month, at 73 million bales or 57 percent of mill use.",
    "July_2019": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include lower beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are reduced with higher 2018/19 residual use more than offsetting lower crush and seed use.  Residual use for 2018/19 is raised based on indications in the June 28 Grain Stocks report combined with crush and export data through May.  Soybean production for 2019/20 is projected at 3.845 billion bushels, down 305 million based on lower planted and harvested area in the June 28 Acreage report and on lower projected yields.  Harvested area, forecast at 79.3 million acres, is down 4.5 million from last month.  With planting progress significantly behind in many states, USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will collect updated information on 2019 area planted, and if the newly collected information justifies changes, updated acreage estimates will be published by NASS in the August Crop Production report.  The soybean yield is forecast at 48.5 bushels per acre, down 1 bushel based on delayed planting progress throughout the major producing states.  Soybean exports are reduced 75 million bushels to 1.875 billion reflecting reduced supplies and increased competition from South American exporters.  With crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 795 million bushels compared with 1.045 billion last month.The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.40 per bushel, up 15 cents from last month.  The soybean meal prices are forecast at $300 per short ton, up 5 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound.The 2019/20 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production and stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is projected at 586.0 million tons, down 11.7 million mostly on lower soybean production for the United States.  Soybean production is also reduced for Canada and Ukraine.  Rapeseed production is reduced for the EU, Australia, and Canada.  Hot, dry weather during June has reduced yield prospects for the EU.  Production is reduced for both Australia and Canada on lower harvested area.  Other production changes include lower sunflowerseed production for Russia, higher cottonseed production for India, and lower peanut production for the United States.  Global oilseed exports for 2019/20 are projected at 175.0 million tons, down slightly from last month.  Lower soybean exports for the United States are offset with increases for Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2019/20 are reduced 10.7 million tons to 119.5 million, mainly on lower soybean stocks for the United States, Argentina, and Brazil.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2019/20 is increased by 95,027 short tons, raw value (STRV) on increases in beginning stocks and production that are only partially offset by a net reduction in imports.  Beginning stocks are increased by 235,818 STRV and sugar production is increased by 121,080 STRV based on harvest area forecast by NASS in the Acreage report for sugarcane in Louisiana and aggregate sugarbeet area across U.S. producing regions.  Imports for 2019/20 are reduced by 261,872 STRV to 2.957 million.  Imports from Mexico are decreased by 449,263 STRV, while total TRQ imports are increased by 187,393 STRV on the announcement of the additional specialty sugar TRQ. Sugar use is reduced by 40,000 STRV.  While projected total refiner license transfers to sugar-containing product and polyhydric alcohol manufacturers under the U.S. Sugar Re-Export Program is unchanged at 339,781 STRV, it is projected that a lesser share corresponding to 40,000 STRV will result from physical shipments reported in Other Deliveries and greater share from license transfer activity accounted for in deliveries for human consumption.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.663 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.50 percent.  (See: Economic Research Service, Sugar and Sweeteners Outlook, August 2018, SSS-M-360, pp. 14-19.)U.S. sugar imports for 2018/19 are increased by 216,138 STRV to 3.091 million.  The reallocation of the 2018/19 raw sugar 121,254-STRV TRQ shortfall is expected to result in additional imports of 66,138 STRV, implying a revised shortfall estimate of 55,115 STRV.  Raw sugar imports from Mexico are increased by 100,000 STRV as a result of an increase in the Export Limit made by the Department of Commerce at the request of USDA in late June.  Re-export imports are increased 50,000 STRV on the pace to date.  Other deliveries are reduced by 20,000 STRV based on the pace to date.  Ending stocks are residually increased to 1.761 million, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.34 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.248 million metric tons, actual weight (MT) assuming the same area harvested in 2018/19 and 5-year averages of sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery.  With no changes to imports, deliveries, or ending stocks, the change in exports for 2019/20 match the 65,468 MT increase in production.  Exports to the United States are projected at 828,897 MT, equal to the expected level of U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 713,045 MT.Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is increased by 25,643 MT to 6.425 million MT based on the final season production report issued by CONADESUCA.  Imports, deliveries, and ending stocks are unchanged.  Residually estimated exports are increased by the 25,643-MT supply increase to 2.179 million MT.  Exports to the United States are estimated at 853,004 MT, an increase of 85,583 MT, and exports to non-U.S destinations are reduced by 59,940 MT. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2019 red meat and poultry production forecast is raised from last month as higher forecast pork and broiler production more than offsets lower beef and turkey production forecasts.  The beef production forecast is reduced primarily on lighter carcass weights and slightly lower third-quarter steer and heifer slaughter.  USDA will release the Cattle report on July 19th, providing a mid-year estimate of U.S. cattle inventory as well as producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for beef cow replacement.  Forecast pork production is raised from last month on higher-than-expected second-quarter commercial hog slaughter.  In addition, the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on June 27th, indicated a first-half pig crop 4 percent above 2018 which supported a higher second-half production forecast.  Second-quarter broiler production is raised on slaughter data, but no change is made to the outlying quarters.  Turkey production is lowered slightly on second-quarter production data.  For 2020, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised on higher forecast pork production.  Although producers indicated intentions to farrow about the same number of sows in the second half of 2019, growth in pigs per litter will help support higher numbers of pigs for slaughter in 2020.  Beef, broiler, and turkey forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.The beef import forecast is raised for 2019, but the export forecast is lowered from the previous month on recent trade data.  The 2020 beef trade forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The pork export forecast for 2019 is lowered on recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2020 export forecast.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is raised on recent trade data and stronger expected global demand in the second half of the year, while the turkey export forecast is little changed.  No change is made to the 2020 broiler and turkey export forecasts. Cattle price forecasts for 2019 are lowered from last month, reflecting current prices.  For 2020, forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  Hog price forecasts are lowered on recent prices and pressure from increased pork production in late 2019.  Hog prices for 2020 are reduced slightly on increased supply pressure.  Broiler price forecasts are lowered for 2019 on current price weakness and continued slow demand.  No changes are made to 2020 broiler price forecasts.  Turkey price forecasts are raised for 2019 and 2020.The milk production forecast for 2019 is unchanged, but the forecast for 2020 is reduced on slower expected growth in milk per cow.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, to be released on July 19th, will provide a mid-year estimate of the dairy cow inventory and producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for dairy cow replacement.For 2019 and 2020, the fat basis import forecasts are raised from the previous month on higher expected imports of butterfat products.  Fat basis exports for 2019 are reduced on slower expected shipments of butterfat products.  The 2020 fat basis export forecast is also reduced on expectations that U.S. butter exports will continue to be less competitive globally.  The skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are unchanged from the previous month.  However, skim-solids basis exports for 2019 and 2020 are reduced from the previous month on lower exports of lactose, whey products, and other dairy products.The 2019 cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts are increased from the previous month while butter and whey price forecasts are reduced.  The 2020 cheese price forecast is raised fractionally as demand is expected to improve, but the butter price forecast is lowered. The whey price forecast is also reduced as export prospects remain relatively weak.  The NDM price forecast is unchanged.  The 2019 Class III price is raised as the higher cheese price more than offsets a lower whey price, and the Class IV price is raised as a higher NDM price more than offsets the lower butter price.  The 2020 Class III price forecast is unchanged as the fractionally higher cheese price is offset by a lower whey price.  The Class IV price forecast reflects a lower butter price.  The 2019 all milk price is forecast higher at $18.20 per cwt, but the all milk price forecast for 2020 is slightly lower than the previous month at $18.85.  COTTON:  The U.S. 2019/20 cotton projections show higher beginning and ending stocks compared with last month.  Beginning stocks are 350,000 bales higher due to decreases in 2018/19 domestic consumption and exports.  A reported slowdown in domestic spinning results in a 100,000-bale decline in consumption, and exports are reduced 250,000 bales based on the pace of recent shipments.  Ending stocks in 2018/19 are raised 300,000 bales to 6.7 million, or 33 percent of use.  The forecast for the marketing-year average price received by producers is reduced 1 cent to 63 cents per pound, a 4-year low.Changes to this month\u2019s 2019/20 world cotton supply and demand estimates are primarily driven by higher beginning stocks (up 1.7 million bales) and lower consumption (down 1.0 million bales), resulting in higher ending stocks (up 3.2 million bales).  Higher beginning stocks stem largely from reduced 2018/19 consumption estimates for Bangladesh and China.  Similarly, 2019/20 world consumption is projected lower as reductions for Bangladesh and China more than offset mill-use gains for India, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam.  World production is nearly 500,000 bales higher this month in both 2018/19 and 2019/20, largely due to increases in India\u2019s crop.   ",
    "June_2019": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include higher beginning and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are raised reflecting a 75-million-bushel reduction in projected exports for 2018/19 based on lower-than-expected shipments in May and a lower import forecast for China.  Although adverse weather has significantly slowed soybean planting progress this year, area and production forecasts are unchanged with several weeks remaining in the planting season.  With soybean use unchanged, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected at 1,045 million bushels, down 25 million from the revised 2018/19 projection.  Other changes for 2018/19 include increased soybean meal imports and exports, reduced soybean oil used for biodiesel production, and higher soybean oil ending stocks.The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.25 per bushel, up 15 cents reflecting the impact of higher corn prices.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $295 per short ton, up 5 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound. The 2019/20 global soybean supply and use projections include lower production and stocks compared to last month.  Global production is down 0.3 million tons to 355.4 million due to lower crops for Ukraine and Zambia.  The 2019/20 soybean ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons mainly reflecting lower carryin due to revisions to 2018/19 balance sheets.  Beginning stocks for 2019/20 are reduced for Argentina and China offsetting higher stocks for the United States.  For Argentina, stocks are lowered on a 1.5-million-ton increase to exports to 7.8 million for 2018/19 based on the recent pace of shipments.  Beginning stocks are lowered for China due to a 1-million-ton decrease to imports to 85 million for 2018/19.SUGAR:  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2019/20 is projected at 33.916 million tons, up 1 percent from last month.  Overall planting progress in the United States advanced beyond the pace indicated last month to move the yield forecast to 30.8 tons/acre, up from 30.5.  Based on average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.992 million short tons, raw value (STRV) with production occurring in August and September at 511,111.  This results in fiscal 2018/19 beet sugar production at 4.920 million STRV, a gain of 9,509 STRV.  This increase is largely offset by lower 2018/19 Florida cane sugar production reported by processors.  High-tier tariff imports for 2018/19 are increased by 20,000 STRV to 90,000 based on the pace of entries to date.  These supply changes result in ending stocks for 2018/19 residually increasing to 1.526 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.40 percent, up marginally over last month.Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.154 million STRV based on the larger sugarbeet crop.  This increase is partially offset by lower cane sugar production in Texas due to weather-related area reductions for the 2019/20 crop as reported by the processor.  With no changes to imports or use, the combination of higher beginning stocks of 20,469 STRV and a net production increase of 23,457 STRV implies ending stocks of 1.528 million and a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.37 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is estimated at 6.400 million metric tons (MT) based on CONADESUCA-estimated area of 796,770 hectares (ha) and USDA estimates of yield at 71.08 MT/ha and sucrose recovery of 11.30 percent.  Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.183 million MT assuming the same area as in 2018/19 and 5-year averages of sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery.  With no other changes, the changes to production result in exports to non-U.S. destinations of 1.386 million MT in 2018/19 and 263,100 MT in 2019/20, based on CONADESUCA targets for ending stocks. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2019 red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month as lower forecast beef, pork, and turkey production more than offset higher broiler production.  The decline in beef production largely reflects lower steer and heifer slaughter in the second half of the year.  Forecast pork production is lowered from last month primarily as the pace of slaughter to date has been slower than expected.  The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights.  Turkey production is lowered slightly on production data to date.  The 2020 red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from the previous month.  Production growth for livestock and poultry is expected to be slower as producers respond to higher feed costs.  The beef production forecast is reduced on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter as incentives to add weight on pasture slows the pace of feedlot placements.  The beef import forecast is raised for 2019 on recent trade data, but the export forecast is reduced from the previous month on the current pace of beef exports to a number of trading partners.  No change is made to the 2020 beef trade forecasts.  Pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised from the previous month, largely reflecting the removal of Mexico\u2019s tariffs on U.S. pork products in late May.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is reduced slightly on recent trade data; no change is made to the 2020 broiler export forecast.  The turkey export forecast is unchanged for 2019 and 2020. For 2019, the cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts are reduced from last month, reflecting current price weakness.  The 2019 turkey price forecast is raised slightly on higher second-quarter prices.  For 2020, cattle, broiler, and egg price forecasts are reduced on continued demand weakness.  The 2020 hog price forecast remains unchanged as slower production growth and stronger exports support prices.  The 2020 turkey price forecast is unchanged.  Milk production for 2019 is lowered from last month on slower-than-anticipated growth in milk per cow and lower expected cow numbers.  The 2020 milk production forecast is reduced from last month as higher expected feed costs are expected to weaken producer margins, limiting growth in the dairy cow herd and milk per cow next year.  The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  The 2019 fat basis export forecast is reduced from the previous month, as gains in cheese exports due to the elimination of tariffs by Mexico only partly offset weakness in butterfat exports to other markets.  The 2020 fat basis export forecast is unchanged. The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2019 is raised from last month on increased imports of milk protein products while the 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged.  The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2019 is reduced on current weakness in exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM), while exports of lactose are expected to be constrained by the additional tariffs imposed by China.  The 2020 skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered on continued weakness in sales of lactose. The 2019 cheese and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month while NDM and butter price forecasts are raised.  For 2020, cheese and butter price forecasts are raised from the previous month, while NDM is unchanged.  The whey price forecast is fractionally lower for 2020.  The 2019 Class III price is reduced on lower cheese and whey price forecasts and the Class IV price forecast is raised on higher forecast butter and NDM prices.  Class III and Class IV prices are raised in 2020.  The all milk price forecast is reduced to $18.00 per cwt for 2019 but is raised to $18.90 per cwt for 2020.COTTON:  The 2019/20 U.S. cotton supply and demand projections are unchanged from last month, with the exception of a 1-cent decline in the season-average upland farm price, to 64 cents per pound.  The 2018/19 U.S. cotton balance sheet is unchanged.The world 2019/20 cotton projections include higher beginning stocks, slightly lower production, lower consumption and trade, and higher ending stocks.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected 1.6 million bales higher than in May, due to a 1.1-million-bale increase in beginning stocks and a 660,000-bale decline in consumption.  Beginning stocks are higher largely due to larger 2018/19 production in India and lower 2018/19 consumption in China.  World consumption and imports in 2019/20 are projected lower largely due to a 500,000-bale decline in each variable\u2019s forecast for China.  Lower exports are expected for Australia due to lower production, but higher expected exports from India are partly offsetting.",
    "September_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 116.1 million tons, up 0.7 million from last month on increased soybean, cottonseed, and peanut production.  Soybean production is forecast at 3,935 million bushels, up 19 million due to a higher yield forecast.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,870 million on increased domestic disappearance of soybean meal, which is raised in line with an increase for 2014/15.  With lower beginning stocks and higher use, soybean ending stocks are projected at 450 million bushels, down 20 million.Changes for 2014/15 include higher exports and crush, resulting in reduced ending stocks.  Exports are increased 10 million to a record 1,835 million bushels based on reported trade through July and indications from August export inspections.  Crush is increased 25 million bushels to 1,870 million on increased soybean meal domestic disappearance and exports.  Ending stocks are projected at 210 million bushels, down 30 million.The 2015/16 U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $8.40 to $9.90 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal prices are also unchanged at $310 to $350 per short ton.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 27.5 to 30.5 cents per pound, down 2 cents on both ends of the range.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 527.2 million tons, down 1.9 million from last month.  Soybean production is reduced for Ukraine, where dry conditions in August lowered yield expectations.  Soybean production is also reduced for Canada with lower yields more than offsetting increased harvested area as reported by Statistics Canada.  Sunflowerseed production forecasts are lowered for several countries including China, the EU, Moldova, and India.  Global rapeseed production is raised slightly with gains for Canada and the EU mostly offset by reductions for India and Turkey.  Other changes include reduced peanut production for India and reduced cottonseed production for Brazil.Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is reduced 1.0 million tons to 143.8 million, mainly reflecting reduced soybean exports for Ukraine.  Global oilseed crush is projected lower on reduced oilseed supplies.  Global oilseed stocks are projected lower mainly on lower soybean stocks in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ukraine, and the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. beginning stocks for 2015/16 are decreased 90,291 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month due to revised estimates for 2014/15, including supply reduction of 6,291, a 119,000 increase in deliveries, and a 35,000 decrease in exports.  Total 2015/16 sugar production is projected at 8.734 million STRV, a 66,000 decrease from last month.  Beet sugar is increased by 54,000 STRV to 5.034 million based on a National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) increase in sugarbeet yield from 29.9 to 30.2 tons per acre.  Florida cane sugar production is increased 30,000 STRV to 1.940 million based on a NASS sugarcane yield increase from 38.0 to 38.8 tons/acre.  Louisiana cane sugar production is decreased 140,000 STRV to 1.450 million based on NASS\u2019s reduction of area harvested by 12,000 acres and a yield decrease from 32.0 to 30.0 tons/acre.  Hawaii sugar production is reduced by 10,000 STRV to 180,000.  Imports for 2015/16 are projected at 3.394 million STRV, an increase of 24,959.  With no change in total use, ending stocks are projected at 1.648 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Mexico beginning stocks for 2015/16 are estimated at 799,975 metric tons (MT), down 36,799 from last month.  Production for 2015/16 is unchanged at 6.0 million.  Sugar deliveries for consumption for 2015/16 are unchanged at 4.501 million MT, but it is assumed that high fructose corn syrup deliveries will be 1.446 million MT, dry weight, for 2014/15 and 2015/16, an increase of 26,000 for both years.  Other deliveries are projected at 323,826 MT to bring total deliveries to 4.825 million. Exports to the United States are forecast at 1.318 million MT, down 7,278 based on changes made in the September sugar WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Exports to other countries are projected at 10,000 MT, the same as last month.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are forecast residually at 802,647 MT, implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 17.8 percent.Mexico beginning stocks for 2015/16 are estimated at 799,975 metric tons (MT), down 36,799 from last month.  Production for 2015/16 is unchanged at 6.0 million.  Sugar deliveries for consumption for 2015/16 are unchanged at 4.501 million MT, but it is assumed that high fructose corn syrup deliveries will be 1.446 million MT, dry weight, for 2014/15 and 2015/16, an increase of 26,000 for both years.  Other deliveries are projected at 323,826 MT to bring total deliveries to 4.825 million. Exports to the United States are forecast at 1.318 million MT, down 7,278 based on changes made in the September sugar WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Exports to other countries are projected at 10,000 MT, the same as last month.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are forecast residually at 802,647 MT, implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 17.8 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2015 and 2016 are lowered from last month.  Beef production for 2015 is lowered due to a slower pace of slaughter in the third quarter, but the decline is partly offset by heavier carcass weights.  The forecast for 2016 is raised as continued increases in carcass weights support higher beef production.  The pork production forecast for 2015 is reduced as the pace of slaughter in the third quarter is lower-than-expected.  No change is made to 2016 forecasts.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 25, providing an estimate of market hog supplies and farrowing intentions into early 2016.  Broiler production for 2015 and 2016 is lowered from last month as producers respond to weaker margins.  Turkey production for 2015 is lowered based on hatchery data, but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.  Egg production for 2015 is lowered based on a slower-than-expected recovery in table egg production and lower hatching egg production, the latter a result of slower growth in the broiler sector.Beef imports are reduced for 2015 based on the pace on imports in July, but the forecast for 2016 is raised as product shipped late in 2015 may not arrive until early 2016.  Beef exports for 2015 are lowered as demand in the second half of the year is projected to remain relatively weak.  Pork import and export forecasts are unchanged.  Broiler exports are reduced from last month as slow demand is expected to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2016. Cattle prices for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month on weaker demand and competition from other meats.  Hog prices are higher for 2015 based on prices in the third quarter.  Broiler prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016 on relatively large broiler meat supplies.  Turkey prices are unchanged from last month.  Egg prices for 2015 are lowered slightly, but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.The milk production forecast for 2015 is raised on a larger expected cow herd and slightly more rapid growth in milk per cow.  However, the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.  Fat-basis imports are increased and exports are reduced for 2015 and 2016.  Domestic demand for butter, and to a lesser extent cheese, encourages imports and limits export potential.  Fat basis ending stocks are raised.  Skim-solids imports are unchanged for 2015 and 2016.  Exports are reduced on lower expected sales of nonfat dry milk and whey.  Domestic demand for butter is expected to support relatively high prices in the United States.  As a result, the butter price forecast is increased for both 2015 and 2016.  Cheese prices are raised for 2015, but increased production in 2016 may pressure prices despite growing domestic demand.  Thus, the price forecast for 2016 is lowered.  Nonfat dry milk prices are forecast higher in 2015 reflecting the recent rebound in prices, but the forecast is unchanged for 2016.  Whey prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016.  Class III prices are reduced for 2015 and 2016, largely reflecting lower whey prices.  Class IV prices are raised primarily due to the higher butter price.  The all milk price is raised to $16.80 to $17.00 per cwt for 2015, but lowered to $16.10 to $17.10 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The 2015/16 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is raised to 13.4 million bales, as an increase of 458,000 bales for Texas is partially offset by revisions for other states.  Domestic mill use is unchanged.  Exports are raised to 10.2 million bales based on the larger available supply.  Ending stocks are now projected at 3.2 million bales, or 23 percent of disappearance.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to range from 56.0 to 68.0 cents per pound, a reduction of 3 cents at the midpoint from last month based on larger U.S. supplies and lower world consumption.Estimated U.S. 2014/15 ending stocks are unchanged from last month at 3.7 million bales, reflecting stocks data from the Farm Services Agency and the Cotton System Consumption and Stocks report of the National Agricultural Statistics Service.  See http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/cws-cotton-and-wool-outlook/cws-15i.aspx after noon on Tuesday, September 15 for a detailed explanation of the stocks calculation.With lower 2015/16 global cotton consumption, and virtually unchanged global supplies, world ending stocks are projected higher than last month.  Production is reduced for Brazil and Pakistan, partially offset by the increase for the United States.  Forecast world consumption is reduced for several countries, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Turkey, as economic uncertainties and rising yarn stocks point to lower-than-expected demand.  World trade is reduced slightly as a result of the lower consumption.  World ending stocks are projected at 106.3 million bales.",
    "September_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 116.2 million tons, up 2.5 million from last month.  Higher soybean production is only partly offset by reductions for peanuts and cottonseed.  Soybean production is projected at a record 3,913 million bushels, up 97 million due to a higher yield forecast.  Soybean exports are raised 25 million bushels to 1,700 million mainly due to increased supplies.  Soybean crush is raised 15 million bushels to a record 1,770 million mostly on increased soybean meal exports, which are raised on record high new-crop export sales.  Domestic use of soybean meal is raised in line with a small increase for 2013/14.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 475 million bushels which would be the highest since 2006/07.Changes for 2013/14 include higher soybean exports and crush and reduced ending stocks.  Exports are increased 5 million bushels to a record 1,645 million based on reported trade through July and indications from August export inspections.  Crush is increased 5 million bushels to 1,730 million.  Ending stocks are projected at 130 million bushels, down 10 million from last month.  Other changes for 2013/14 include increased soybean meal imports and domestic disappearance, lower soybean meal exports, and increased soybean oil exports.Soybean and product prices are all projected lower for 2014/15.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $9.00 to $11.00 per bushel, down 35 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $330 to $370 per short ton, down $10.00 on both ends of the range.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 34 to 38 cents per pound, down 1 cent on both ends of the range.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 528.0 million tons, up 6.2 million from last month.  Soybeans account for most of the change.  In addition to the United States, projected soybean production is increased for Brazil and Argentina where relative prices favor soybeans over corn.  Brazil soybean production is raised 3 million tons to 94 million and Argentina is raised 1 million tons to 55 million.  Rapeseed production is raised for the EU reflecting exceptional weather across much of the northern producing areas.  Mostly offsetting gains for the EU, rapeseed production for Canada is reduced to reflect lower yields reported by Statistics Canada.  Other changes include higher sunflowerseed production for the EU, lower sunflowerseed production for Argentina and Bolivia, lower peanut production for China and India, higher India cottonseed production, and increased palm oil production for Malaysia.Global oilseed trade for 2014/15 is raised 1.8 million tons to 134.0 million mainly reflecting soybean exports for the United States and Brazil.  Soybean imports are raised 1 million tons for China to 74 million and for several other countries including the EU, Japan, and Vietnam.  Global oilseed crush is projected higher on increased supplies and lower prices.  Global oilseed stocks are projected higher mainly on higher soybean stocks in Argentina, Brazil, the United States, and China.SUGAR:  For the United States, sugar imports from Mexico for 2013/14 are increased by 82,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on pace to date through August and 50,000 expected to enter in September, the last month of the fiscal year.  Imports for re-export programs are increased by 60,000 STRV to 270,000 based on pace to date.  Total imports are estimated at 3.787 million STRV.  Because there are no other changes for 2013/14, ending stocks are increased by the total addition to imports to 1.893 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 15.2 percent.  For 2014/15, beginning stocks are higher by 142,000 STRV.  The 2014/15 beet sugar production is increased by 50,000 STRV based on a processor-reported 3.3 percent sugarbeet yield increase over last month\u2019s yield.  Tariff-rate quota (TRQ) sugar imports are forecast higher by 116,000 STRV due to provision for additional specialty sugar imports made when USDA established the TRQ on September 2.  Imports from Mexico for 2014/15 are reduced by 117,000 STRV to 1.088 million.  With no changes to sugar use, ending stocks are projected residually at 1.028 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 8.5 percent.For Mexico, 2013/14 sugar exports are increased by 100,000 metric tons (MT) with an additional 70,000 exported to the United States for a total of 1.828 million and 30,000 exported to other countries for a total of 680,000.  With no other changes, endings stocks for 2013/14 are estimated down by 100,000 MT to 614,000.  The resulting 14.6 percent stocks-to-consumption ratio implies a tight market until the full start of the 2014/15 harvest in mid-December.  For 2014/15, there are no changes to projections for imports, production, or deliveries.  Ending stocks at 947,000 MT are held the same as last month to 22.0 percent of 2014/15 human consumption of 4.306 million.  Exports are projected residually at 1.516 million MT.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations based on contracts are still at 585,000 MT, implying exports to the United States at 931,000 MT, down 100,000 MT from last month.  Given U.S.-world raw sugar price margins close to or over 10 cents per pound, the preliminary countervailing duties determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce at about 15 percent are not high enough to discourage exports to the United States.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2014 and 2015 are reduced from last month.  For 2014, beef production is down as supplies of cattle coming out of feedlots have been below expectations.  However, this is partly offset by higher expected dressed weights as lower feed costs and reduced heifer and cow slaughter boost weights.  Pork production is marginally lower as higher dressed weights are more than offset by a reduction in slaughter.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 26, providing an estimate of farrowing intentions into early 2015.  Broiler production is increased as hatchery data shows stronger increases in the number of eggs set and chicks placed.  Turkey production is slightly higher based on production data to date.  Egg production reflects actual data for the second quarter, but no changes are made to the forecasts.  For 2015, beef production is cut as lower placements of cattle in the second half of 2014 are expected to reduce supplies of fed cattle in 2015 despite heavier carcass weights.  Pork production is higher on heavier dressed weights.  Broiler production is raised as expected favorable returns support further expansion by producers.  The egg production forecast is increased.Forecasts for 2014 and 2015 beef imports are higher due to tight cull cow supplies and strong consumer demand for processing grade beef.  Beef exports for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged.  Pork trade is unchanged for 2014 and 2015.  Broiler exports are unchanged for 2014, but the 2015 forecast is raised as greater supplies and lower prices boost exports.  Turkey export forecasts are raised for 2014 and 2015.   The cattle price forecast for 2014 is raised from last month on tightness in supplies of fed cattle.  The price forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Hog price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are lowered from last month as recent lower price levels are expected to carry into next year.  Broiler price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are lowered as supplies increase.  The turkey price forecast for 2014 is raised based on recent price data, with the forecast for 2015 unchanged.  Egg price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are virtually unchanged.  The milk production forecast for 2014 is raised on growth in output per cow, but the forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Export forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are lowered as higher forecast U.S. prices for butter and cheese make those products less competitive in world markets and sales of a number of other dairy products are limited as well.  Skim-solids and fat-basis imports are raised for both 2014 and 2015 as supplies in competing exporters are expected to be large while U.S. prices remain relatively high.  Butter and cheese price forecasts are raised for 2014 with strength in both expected to continue into the first part of 2015.  Nonfat dry milk prices are forecast lower in 2014 and 2015.  The forecast whey price is unchanged for 2014 but is lowered fractionally for 2015.  Class III prices for 2014 and 2015 are raised.  The Class IV price is higher in 2014 but reduced in 2015.  The all milk price is raised to $23.80 to $24.00 per cwt for 2014, and is lowered for 2015 to $19.40 to $20.40 per cwt.COTTON:  Revisions to the monthly forecasts of 2014/15 U.S. cotton beginning stocks, production, and exports result in lower ending stocks relative to last month\u2019s estimate.  Beginning stocks are adjusted based on reported stocks in public storage as of July 31, 2014, which are significantly less than the calculation of supply minus use for 2013/14.  Production for the 2014 crop is reduced nearly 1.0 million bales, as USDA\u2019s second crop survey of the season shows reductions mainly for Texas, Georgia, and Arkansas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged.  Exports are reduced 700,000 bales on lower domestic supplies and reduced foreign import demand.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 5.2 million bales, equivalent to 38 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average farm price of 58 to 70 cents per pound is lowered 2 cents on the upper end, with a midpoint of 64 cents.This month\u2019s world 2014/15 forecasts include a larger supply and lower offtake, resulting in an increase of 1.2 million bales in world ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are raised mainly in China and India, partially offset by decreases for several countries, including the United States.  Production is raised for India, the African Franc Zone, and Turkey but is reduced for the United States, Argentina, and Uzbekistan.  A reassessment of trade data for Pakistan points to lower consumption beginning in 2012/13 and accounts for most of this season\u2019s decrease in global consumption from last month; however, world consumption is still expected to grow nearly 4 percent in 2014/15.  In addition to lower imports for Pakistan, imports are reduced for India and Turkey, based on higher forecast production, but are raised for Vietnam.  Exports are reduced mainly for the United States, Uzbekistan, and India.",
    "June_2018": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2018/19 include lower beginning stocks, slightly higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Lower beginning stocks reflect higher crush for 2017/18.  Soybean crush for 2017/18 is raised 25 million bushels to 2,015 million reflecting an increase in projected soybean meal domestic disappearance and exports.  Higher soybean meal domestic disappearance reflects stronger-than-expected use for the marketing year through April.  Soybean meal exports are raised based in part on commitments through May.  Soybean ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 505 million bushels, down 25 million from last month.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 385 million bushels, down 30 million from last month.Price forecasts for 2018/19 are unchanged this month.  The 2018/19 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.75 to $11.25 per bushel; soybean meal and oil prices are projected at $330 to $370 per short ton and 29.5 to 33.5 cents per pound, respectively.The 2018/19 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and stocks compared to last month.  Higher global soybean production is partly offset by lower rapeseed and cottonseed.  Soybean production is up 0.7 million tons to 355.2 million mainly on higher production for Brazil.  A higher trend yield for the 2018/19 Brazil soybean crop reflects harvest and yield results for the 2017/18 crop, which is increased 2 million tons to 119 million.  With higher production, soybean exports for Brazil are revised up for both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 marketing years.  Ending stocks for Brazil are also increased with higher production and a lower crush estimate for 2016/17.  Global 2018/19 soybean ending stocks are increased 0.3 million tons to 87.0 million with higher stocks for Brazil partly offset by lower stocks for the United States and Argentina.  Stocks for Argentina are lowered mainly on a 2.0-million-ton reduction to the 2017/18 crop to 37 million.  Other changes include lower EU rapeseed production which is reduced on lower yields for Germany and Poland, where crops experienced warm and dry weather conditions through key flowering stages.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2018/19 is decreased 44,387 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.203 million on lower beginning stocks and lower cane sugar production.  Cane sugar production in Texas is lowered by 20,000 STRV to 160,000 based on processor-reported lower area harvested but with the same crop yield and sucrose recovery as in the previous year. Imports for 2018/19 are unchanged and like last month, projected TRQ imports of specialty sugar include only the WTO minimum quantity as additional quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture.  Exports are increased by 35,000 STRV to 85,000 on larger expected shipments to Mexico. U.S. sugar supply for 2017/18 is decreased 49,387 STRV on lower cane sugar production and fewer imports.  Florida cane sugar production for 2017/18 is reduced 14,387 STRV on processors\u2019 estimates.  Re-export imports are reduced 50,000 STRV.  Partially offsetting this reduction is an increase in high-tier tariff imports as indicated in preliminary U.S. Customs import data.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 25,000 STRV based on pace-to-date, but this reduction is tempered by high raw sugar stocks held by cane refiners for this time of year.In Mexico 2018/19 sugar imports are increased by 30,767 metric tons (MT) to 115,000.  The end uses of these imports are forecast for human consumption and are projected to be imported from the United States. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2018 forecast for total meat production is lowered from last month, but production forecasts are unchanged for 2019.  Beef production for 2018 is lowered primarily as lighter carcass weights more than offset higher second-quarter steer and heifer and cow slaughter.  Pork production for 2018 is lowered on the current pace of second-quarter slaughter and lower-expected commercial slaughter in the third quarter.  Slightly heavier expected hog carcass weights in the second and third quarters partially offset declines in slaughter.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released June 28th and will provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of 2018.  Broiler production for 2018 is raised on the pace of second-quarter production data and stronger growth in production during the second half of the year.  Turkey production in the second quarter of 2018 is raised on the current pace of slaughter; no changes are made to outlying quarters.  Egg production for 2018 is raised on recent hatchery data. The 2018 beef import forecast is raised on increased shipments from Oceania, while the beef export forecast is raised largely on strong Asian demand reflected in recent trade data.  The 2018 pork export forecast is raised on continued strong shipments to a number of key markets and expectations of continued pork exports to Mexico.  Pork exports for 2019 are raised on expected strong demand to a number of key trading partners.  Second-half 2018 turkey export forecasts are raised as U.S. prices remain attractive.  The 2018 broiler trade forecast is unchanged from the previous month.  No changes are made to 2019 beef and poultry trade forecasts. Cattle prices for 2018 are lowered slightly on second-quarter price data; no changes are made to outlying quarters.  Hog prices are raised for the second quarter of 2018 on current price strength, but no changes are made to the outlying quarters.  Second-quarter broiler prices are lowered for 2018; no changes are made to outlying quarters.  Turkey prices are increased fractionally for 2018, reflecting a higher second-quarter forecast.  Egg prices for 2018 are lowered on recent price data.  For 2019, hog prices are lowered on weaker expected demand, but no changes are made to cattle, poultry, and egg price forecasts for 2019.The milk production forecast for 2018 is reduced from last month on slightly lower cow numbers and slower expected growth in milk per cow.  No change is made to the annual cow herd for 2019, but the milk production forecast for 2019 is lowered from last month on continued slow growth in milk per cow.  For 2018, fat basis exports are raised from the previous month as second-quarter exports are strong and continued strength in sales of a number of fat-containing products will largely mitigate the impacts of Mexico\u2019s tariffs on U.S. cheese.  For 2019, the fat basis export forecast is lowered.  Skim-solids basis export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised from the previous month on robust demand for non-fat dry milk and lactose thus far in 2018, and this strength is expected to carry into 2019.  Fat basis imports for 2018 and 2019 are raised on higher imports of butterfat products, while skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced on lower imports of milk proteins and a number of other dairy products. The 2018 cheese price is unchanged at the midpoint of the range, but is raised for 2019.  The 2018 butter price forecast is raised, but is reduced slightly for 2019.  Nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey price forecasts are raised for both 2018 and 2019 on strong demand and a reduced production forecast.  For 2018, the Class III price is raised on the stronger whey price.  The Class IV price forecasts reflects higher butter and NDM prices.  For 2019, both Class III and Class IV prices are raised.  The all milk price is forecast higher at $16.60 to $17.00 per cwt for 2018 and is increased to $16.70 to $17.70 per cwt for 2019.COTTON:  The most significant revision to this month\u2019s U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates is a 500,000-bale increase in 2017/18 exports, to 16.0 million bales, due to above-average late-season shipments.  U.S. ending stocks are now forecast at 4.2 million bales in 2017/18, and 4.7 million bales in 2018/19, for a stocks-to-use ratio of 25 percent.  The projected range of the marketing-year-average farm price is raised 5 cents at each end to 60-80 cents per pound.The 2018/19 world projections include lower production for China, Pakistan, and Australia offset in part for higher production for Brazil.  World production is nearly 800,000 bales lower this month, while 2018/19 consumption is reduced only 85,000 bales, as a 225,000-bale reduction for South Korea is largely offset by increases for Uzbekistan and Vietnam.  World beginning stocks for 2018/19 are unchanged from a month earlier, but ending stocks are 725,000 bales lower.  At 83.0 million bales, 2018/19 world ending stocks are projected 5.2 million bales lower than a year earlier, but stocks outside of China are expected to rise for the third consecutive year.",
    "July_2018": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2018/19 include lower supplies, lower exports, higher crush, and higher ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are reduced on increased exports and crush for 2017/18.  Soybean production for 2018/19 is projected at 4.310 billion bushels, up 30 million on increased harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at 88.9 million acres in the Acreage report, is up 0.7 million from last month.  The soybean yield forecast is unchanged at 48.5 bushels per acre.Soybean crush for 2018/19 is raised 45 million bushels to 2.045 billion reflecting an increase in projected soybean meal domestic disappearance and exports.  Domestic soybean meal disappearance is raised on lower soybean meal prices and increased livestock production.  Soybean and product trade changes reflect the impact of China\u2019s recently imposed soybean import duties in addition to other global oilseed supply and demand changes this month.  U.S. soybean meal exports are raised to offset reduced meal exports from South America where higher soybean exports displace crush.  Soybean exports are reduced 250 million bushels to 2.040 billion reflecting the impact of China\u2019s import duties.  Despite losing market share in China, soybean exports are supported in other markets as lower U.S. prices increase demand and market share.  Soybean ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 580 million bushels, up 195 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.00 to $10.50 per bushel, down $0.75 at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $315 to $355 per short ton, down $15.00 at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price forecast at 28 to 32 cents per pound, down 1.5 cents at the midpoint.The 2018/19 global soybean supply and demand forecasts include higher production and lower trade and crush compared to last month.  The tariff that China recently imposed on U.S. soybeans is expected to cause higher prices for soybeans in China and slower protein meal consumption growth. Lower demand and a year-over-year drawdown in stocks for China are forecast to result in reduced crush and an 8-million-ton decline for imports to 95 million.  Parallel to this change is a 6.8-million-ton decline for U.S. exports that is partly offset by a 2.1-million-ton increase for Brazil.  Planted area for Brazil for 2018/19 is expected to expand with higher prices resulting from increased trade with China, leading to a 2.5-million-ton increase in production to 120.5 million.  With lower soybean crush and reduced soybean oil production, China is expected to increase imports of other vegetable oils, including soybean, palm, and rapeseed.Total global 2018/19 oilseed production is down 1.4 million tons to 592.6 million with a 4.3-million-ton increase for soybean production offset by lower rapeseed and sunflower.  Rapeseed production is reduced 2.6 million tons with lower production for the EU, Australia, Ukraine, and Russia.  In the EU, rapeseed production is lowered for Germany and the UK on persistent dryness while production is lowered for France on pest pressure.  Sunflowerseed production is down 2.9 million tons mainly for Russia and Ukraine on lower yields from dry conditions.  SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2018/19 is increased 143,867 short tons, raw value (STRV) as increases in beginning stocks and imports more than offset a reduction in cane sugar production.  The increase in imports results from the Secretary of Agriculture establishing 2018/19 sugar tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) that include an allocation for specialty sugar beyond the minimum level that the United States is bound under the WTO.  In addition there is a small increase in projected imports from Mexico.  Cane sugar production is reduced in all producing States.  Production changes in Florida and Louisiana result from applying updated yield and recovery projections on NASS 2018/19 area harvested forecasts.  Texas production is reduced on processor reporting.  U.S. sugar use for 2018/19 is reduced by 100,000 STRV on lower deliveries for human consumption.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.707 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.U.S. beet sugar production for 2017/18 is increased 55,000 STRV to 5.276 million based on processor reporting of late season sucrose recovery from sugarbeet slicing to a robust 15.2 percent.  High-tier tariff imports are increased 15,000 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 65,000 STRV to 12.235 million on a continuing slow pace as refiners\u2019 inventories of raw stocks remain elevated.Mexico production for 2017/18 is increased to 6.009 million metric tons (MT) on official preliminary reporting of the completed harvest season.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are estimated at 1.246 million MT based on domestic consumption in 2018/19 before the start of the campaign and sugar that can be exported to the United States in 2018/19 at a return that is expected to be higher than can currently be obtained in the world market.  Exports for 2017/18 to non-U.S. destinations are residually increased by 36,375 MT.  For 2018/19, exports to the United States are increased by a small amount to 1.417 million MT to equal U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for 2018 red meat and poultry production are raised from last month.  The beef production forecast is raised on higher expected cow slaughter in the third quarter.  USDA will release the Cattle report on July 20th, providing a mid-year estimate of the U.S. cattle inventory as well as producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for beef cow replacement.  Forecast pork production is raised from last month as higher expected second-half hog slaughter more than offsets lower second-quarter slaughter.  A more rapid pace of hog slaughter is expected in the third quarter and USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the March-May pig crop was 4 percent above 2017 which will result in higher fourth-quarter hog slaughter.  Second and third-quarter broiler production is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights.  Turkey production is raised slightly on production data to date.  Egg production is raised from the previous month as egg prices are forecast higher and feed costs lower.  For 2019, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised as increases in pork and broiler production more than offsets expected declines in beef production.  Forecast beef production is reduced from the previous month on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter the first half of the year.  The pork production forecast is raised; the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that producers intend to farrow 2 percent more hogs over the next two quarters, which coupled with expected growth in pigs per litter will push first-half hog slaughter higher.  Forecast broiler and egg production is also raised from the previous month, as higher prices and lower expected feed prices support continued expansion.  Forecast turkey production is unchanged from the previous month.     The beef import forecast is unchanged for 2018, but the export forecast is raised from the previous month on recent trade data and continued strong exports to Asia.  The 2019 beef export forecast is also raised from last month.  Pork trade forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month.  Lower pork product prices are expected to help offset increased competition in key markets in 2019.  No change is made to 2018 and 2019 broiler and turkey export forecasts.  The 2018 egg export forecast is raised on recent trade data, but no change is made to the outlying quarters.  Small revisions are made to historical trade estimates.The cattle price forecast for 2018 is lowered slightly from last month, reflecting June price data.  Forecast 2019 cattle prices are unchanged from the previous month.  The hog price forecast is raised for 2018 as recent price strength and expected higher prices in the third quarter more than offset lower prices in the fourth quarter.  The hog price forecast for 2019 is lowered on increased supplies of pork.  Broiler prices are raised for 2018 on current price strength while turkey prices are unchanged.  No changes are made for 2019 broiler and turkey price forecasts.  Egg prices are raised for 2018 on higher-than-expected prices to date.  The 2019 egg price is reduced slightly on increased supplies.  Milk production forecasts for both 2018 and 2019 are lowered from last month on slower-than-anticipated growth in milk per cow and lower cow numbers.  Although tempered by lower expected feed costs, lower milk prices will likely weaken producer margins, resulting in lower cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, to be released on July 20th, will provide a mid-year estimate of dairy cow and dairy replacement heifer inventories.For 2018, the fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher imports of butterfat products.  Fat basis imports are unchanged for 2019.  The 2018 fat basis export forecast is unchanged from the previous month but is raised for 2019 as the U.S. is expected to be price competitive and higher expected exports of butterfat products will more than offset expected declines in cheese exports.  Skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from the previous month.  However, skim-solids basis exports for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from the previous month primarily on lower expected exports of skim milk powder and whey products as China\u2019s tariffs on certain U.S. dairy products hampers exports to some extent. The 2018 butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month.  Forecasts are reduced for cheese, NDM, and whey prices for 2019 as cheese stocks will remain large and prices for NDM and whey will have to remain competitive with competing exporters.  However, the 2019 butter price is raised as stocks are worked down.  The 2018 and 2019 Class III price and Class IV price forecasts are lowered from last month.  The 2018 all milk price is forecast at $15.95 to $16.25 and the price for 2019 is $16.25 to $17.25 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2018/19 cotton projections show lower production, exports, and stocks compared with last month.  The 1.0-million-bale decrease in the crop projection is due to higher expected abandonment based on current conditions.  Beginning stocks are 200,000 bales lower due to an increase in 2017/18 exports.  2018/19 exports are reduced 500,000 bales based on lower supplies and increased foreign competition.  With no change in domestic consumption, 2018/19 ending stocks are projected at 4.0 million bales, down 700,000 bales from the June estimate and unchanged from the revised 2017/18 level.  The midpoint of the projected range of the marketing-year-average price is raised 5 cents from last month, to 75 cents per pound.Historical revisions to China\u2019s consumption back to 2014/15 account for most of a 3.3-million-bale decline in 2018/19 world beginning stocks.  World 2018/19 consumption is 1.6 million bales higher than in June, as the revisions to China\u2019s consumption estimates carry through into the 2018/19 projection year with a 1.0-million-bale increase.  Consumption forecasts are also higher for Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, and Vietnam.  World production is projected 290,000 bales lower than in June, as reduced U.S. and Australian production more than offsets increases for Brazil, India, and Mexico.  World trade is projected 165,000 bales higher this month as lower U.S. exports are more than offset by increases by Brazil and China.  Ending stocks are 5.2 million bales lower than in June, with the largest declines in China (4.6 million) and the United States.  India\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s ending stocks are forecast higher.",
    "July_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2020/21 is projected at 122.8 million tons, down 0.4 million from last month, with increases for soybeans and peanuts offset with reductions for canola, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed.  Soybean production is projected at 4.14 billion bushels, up 10 million on increased harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at 83.0 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is up 0.2 million from last month.  The soybean yield forecast is unchanged at 49.8 bushels per acre.  With higher beginning stocks, 2020/21 soybean supplies are raised 45 million bushels.  Soybean crush is raised 15 million bushels reflecting an increase in domestic soybean meal disappearance which is raised in line with an increase for 2019/20.  With projections for exports unchanged, 2020/21 soybean ending stocks are increased 30 million bushels to 425 million.Soybean changes for 2019/20 include higher crush, lower residual use, and higher ending stocks.  Soybean residual use is reduced 50 million bushels, reflecting June 1 soybean stocks reported in the recent Grain Stocks report, and reported soybean use through May.  Soybean ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 620 million bushels, up 35 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $8.50 per bushel, up $0.30 partly reflecting higher price expectations following the June Acreage report.  The soybean meal price is projected at $300.00 per short ton, up $10.00 from last month.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.0 cents per pound.The 2020/21 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, lower exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is reduced 2.0 million tons to 604.2 million on lower rapeseed, cottonseed, and soybean production.  Canola production is lowered for Canada based on updated government data.  Soybean production is lowered for Canada and Uruguay, resulting in lower 2020/21 exports for both countries.The 2020/21 global soybean ending stocks are reduced 1.3 million tons to 95.1 million as lower stocks for Brazil and China are partly offset by higher U.S. stocks.  Lower foreign stocks reflect notable balance sheet revisions for Brazil in 2019/20 and China in 2019/20 and 2020/21.  For Brazil, the 2019/20 crop is increased 2 million tons to 126 million, reflecting higher yields.  Exports are increased 4 million tons to 89 million, leading to a 2-million-ton reduction to ending stocks.  The local year exports (February 2020-January 2021) are also increased 2.5 million tons to 79.5 million.  China\u2019s 2019/20 balance sheet changes include a 2-million-ton increase in imports to 96 million and a 1-million-ton increase to crush, resulting in higher ending stocks.  For 2020/21, China\u2019s higher beginning stocks are offset by higher crush, leading to lower ending stocks.  With these changes, China\u2019s year-over-year soybean meal domestic disappearance growth remains at 7 percent.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is increased 187,367 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 13.921 million based on an increase in beginning stocks and production only partially offset by a reduction in imports.  An increase in beginning stocks of 140,070 STRV results from increases in 2019/20 FTA TRQ imports from the implementation of USMCA and in 2019/20 imports from Mexico.  Combined national beet sugar production and cane sugar production in 2020/21 are increased by 85,000 STRV based on projected increases in area harvested reported in the NASS Acreage report.  TRQ imports for 2020/21 are increased by the quantity of specialty sugar beyond the WTO minimum as announced by the Secretary of Agriculture (154,323 STRV) and by projected FTA imports from Canada under USMCA (30,581 STRV).  Imports from Mexico are projected at 1.079 million STRV, a reduction of 222,607 from last month.  Net imports for 2020/21 are thereby reduced 37,703 STRV.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.656 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Under the USMCA effective July 1, 2020, Canada is to receive a calendar year export allotment of 9,600 metric tons (MT) of refined beet sugar for the entry into the U.S. market.  USTR set the allotment for the remainder of 2020 at 4,800 MT, one-half of the annual amount.  The allotment for 2021 is assumed at the full statutory level.  USTR also granted Canada 20 percent of the 181,437 MT additional refined sugar TRQ established in April before the implementation of the USMCA.  The 20-percent level of any addition to the refined sugar TRQ is set out in the USMCA and only applies in this case to calendar year 2020.  These allocated amounts are prorated on a quarterly basis across the final two quarters of 2020 and the first three quarters of 2021. Mexico production for 2019/20 is estimated at 5.282 million MT.  This is an increase of 52,000 MT over last month mostly on better yields.  FAS Mexico City Post reporting supports downward adjustments of 43,604 MT reflecting combined lower deliveries to the IMMEX re-export program and for human consumption.  Required ending stocks to meet delivery needs for the 2.5 months before the start of the 2020/21 sugarcane campaign are lowered on the basis of lower projected deliveries in 2020/21.  The net result of these changes is to increase residually determined exportable supply by 119,979 MT.  Exports to the United States are increased to 1.194 million MT.  Raw exports to the United States are estimated between 740,000 and 757,000 MT from 2019/20 production and beginning raw sugar stock levels.Mexico sugar supply and use for 2020/21 has fewer beginning stocks, lower projected deliveries for IMMEX and human consumption, and reduced stocks.  The net effect is to increase exports by 117,000 MT to 1.731 million.  Exports to the United States are reduced to 923,253 MT on calculated U.S. Needs as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements.  Exports to third-country destinations are residually increased to 807,747 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2020 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  The beef production forecast is raised primarily on higher cattle slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  USDA will release the Cattle report on July 24, providing a mid-year estimate of U.S. cattle inventory as well as producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for beef cow replacement.  Forecast pork production is raised from last month largely on higher expected second-half commercial hog slaughter.  Broiler production is raised on recent hatchery data while turkey production is lowered on recent production and hatchery data.  Egg production is lowered from last month on a reduced laying flock and a reduction in eggs per layer.For 2021, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised as higher expected beef, pork, and broiler production more than offsets lower forecast turkey production.  Forecast beef production is raised from the previous month as higher expected placements in late 2020 and early 2021 will result in higher marketings.  The pork production forecast is raised as the sector continues to adjust to the effects of COVID-19.  Broiler production is raised from last month while turkey and egg production forecasts are reduced.The beef import forecast is raised for 2020, but the export forecast is lowered from the previous month on recent trade data.  The 2021 beef trade forecasts are unchanged from last month.  Pork export forecasts for 2020 and 2021 are raised from last month as international demand is expected to remain robust.  The 2020 broiler export forecast is reduced on recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2021 forecast.  Turkey export forecasts are lowered for 2020 and 2021 on weak import demand from key trading partners. Cattle price forecasts for 2020 are lowered from last month on prices to date and continued large supplies of fed cattle.  Forecast 2021 cattle prices are unchanged.  The 2020 hog price forecast is reduced on current price weakness and supply pressure.  The 2021 hog price forecast is also reduced on higher hog supplies.  Broiler prices for 2020 are raised fractionally on slightly higher second-quarter prices; no change is made to the 2021 broiler price.  Turkey price forecasts for 2020 and 2021 are raised as production is reduced.  The 2020 egg price forecast is reduced on current price weakness, but the 2021 egg price forecast is unchanged.The milk production forecast for 2020 is lowered from last month largely on slower growth in milk per cow.  However, the 2021 milk production forecast is raised from last month on expectations of dairy herd rebuilding and a recovery in growth in milk per cow.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, to be released on July 24, will provide a mid-year estimate of the dairy cow inventory and producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for dairy cow replacement.For 2020, the fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher imports of butter, while the fat basis export forecast is raised on increased shipments of cheese and butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged from the previous month, but the export forecast is raised on higher expected exports of dry skim milk products and lactose.  Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are raised from the previous month on recent price strength and anticipated demand strength.  The whey price forecast is lowered from last month.  Class III and Class IV milk prices are raised for 2020, and the all milk price forecast is raised to $18.25 per cwt.For 2021, the fat basis import and export forecasts are raised.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged, but the export forecast is raised on strong international demand for skim milk powder.  For 2021, cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk price forecasts are raised from the previous month while the whey price is unchanged.  The 2021 Class III and Class IV milk price forecasts are raised from last month, and the all milk price forecast is raised to $17.05 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2020/21 cotton projections show lower production, exports, and stocks compared with last month.  Beginning stocks are 200,000 bales lower due to higher 2019/20 exports, but exports in 2020/21 are reduced 1 million bales as a 2-million-bale decline in projected output reduces exportable supplies.  U.S. planted area is 1.5 million acres lower this month, as indicated in the June 30 Acreage report.  Ending stocks are projected at 6.8 million bales, 1.2 million lower than in June, and equivalent to 38 percent of use.  The projected price received by U.S. upland cotton producers is 59 cents this month, 2 cents higher than in June.Global projected ending stocks in 2020/21 are lower this month as well, down 1.9 million bales, largely due to a 2.5-million-bale reduction in projected world production.  While the United States accounted for most of the global decline in production, projections were also reduced for Turkey, Tanzania, and Mexico, more than offsetting a 200,000-bale increase for Pakistan.  Consumption in 2020/21 is projected 115,000 bales lower this month.  At 114.3 million bales, consumption is expected to rise 11.7 percent from the previous year\u2019s recession-reduced level.",
    "June_2020": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2020/21 include higher beginning stocks, higher crush, and slightly lower ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are raised 5 million bushels with higher crush for 2019/20 more-than-offset with lower production and a lower export forecast.  Lower 2019 production reflects the latest re-survey by NASS for North Dakota.  The 2019/20 soybean crush is raised 15 million bushels reflecting increased domestic soybean meal use.  Soybean exports are reduced 25 million bushels on increased competition from South America.  Increased beginning stocks for 2020/21 are more than offset with a higher soybean crush forecast, which is raised along with increased domestic soybean meal use.  With higher soybean crush more than offsetting higher beginning stocks, 2020/21 ending stocks are projected at 395 million bushels.  The 2020/21 season-average soybean and product price forecasts are unchanged this month.The 2020/21 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include slightly higher production and lower ending stocks compared to last month.  Higher peanut, soybean, and sunflowerseed production is partly offset by lower cottonseed output.  A notable revision to production is for EU canola, lowered 0.2 million tons to 16.8 million, based largely on lower yields for Germany.  The EU revision is offset by higher Australian canola production.  The 2020/21 soybean ending stocks are lowered 2.1 million tons to 96.3 million, mainly reflecting lower carryin due to revisions to 2019/20 balance sheets.  For 2019/20, soybean exports are increased 1 million tons each for Argentina and Brazil based on the recent pace of shipments and reflect increased crush demand and imports for China.  Partly offsetting is reduced 2019/20 U.S. exports.  These revisions result in higher stocks for China and lower stocks for South America.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2019/20 is increased 284,479 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 13.822 million based on an increase in estimated imports.  Imports from Mexico are increased by 204,479 STRV on greater export supply availability.  High-tier tariff imports are increased by 80,000 STRV to 230,000 on pace and on favorable margins between U.S. and world sugar prices.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are reduced by 75,000 STRV to 12.050 million based on an initial analysis of the effects of pandemic lockdowns on the demand for sugar.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2020/21 are unchanged at 12.125 million STRV.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are residually calculated at 1.632 million STRV, an increase of 359,479.  The ending stocks-to-use ratio is at 13.4 percent, up from 10.4 percent last month.  For 2020/21 the increase in beginning stocks is exactly offset by a decrease in projected imports from Mexico.  There are no other changes made for 2020/21. The Secretary of Agriculture has not yet announced additional quantities of specialty sugar beyond the WTO minimum quantity.  The ending stocks-to-use ratio for 2020/21 remains at 12.0 percent.Mexico production for 2019/20 is estimated at 5.230 million metric tons (MT).  This is an increase of 105,000 MT on increases in field and factory yields only partially offset by lower area harvested as the production campaign winds down.  Deliveries of domestically produced sugar to the IMMEX program are reduced by 70,000 MT based on reporting by the FAS Mexico City Post.  Exports to the U.S. market are increased by 175,000 MT to 1.074 million on the increase of exportable supply.  There are no changes for the 2020/21 Mexico sugar balance.  Ending stocks for both 2020/21 and 2019/20 are set equal to 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar deliveries before the start of the succeeding sugarcane harvest.  Although total exports for 2020/21 are unchanged, exports to the U.S. market are reduced by 307,245 MT and exports to third-country destinations are increased by the same amount. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2020 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher forecast beef, pork, and broiler production more than offsets lower turkey production.  The increase in beef and pork production largely reflects a faster-than-anticipated recovery in the pace of slaughter.  The broiler production forecast is raised as broiler hatchery data points towards higher expected production in the second half of the year.  Turkey production is lowered slightly on recent production data and a slower expected growth in expansion.  Egg production is lowered from the previous month. The 2021 red meat and poultry production forecast is raised from the previous month.  The beef production forecast is raised on higher expected cattle placements in the second half of 2020 which will be marketed in 2021.  Pork production is unchanged from last month.  The Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on June 25 and provide an indication of producers\u2019 farrowing intentions for the second half of 2020; these are hogs which will likely be marketed in first-half 2021.  The broiler production forecast for 2021 is unchanged from last month, but turkey production is reduced as forecast slower growth in 2020 production is carried into 2021.  The egg production forecast is reduced from the previous month. The beef import forecast is raised for 2020 on recent trade data and increased domestic demand for processing grade beef, while the beef export forecast is raised on higher expected beef exports later in the year.  No change is made to the 2021 beef trade forecast.  The pork export forecast for 2020 is raised from the previous month, largely on the current pace of exports.  No change is made to the 2021 pork trade forecast.  No change is made to 2020 and 2021 broiler export forecasts.  Turkey export forecasts are lowered for 2020 and 2021 on weaker export demand. For 2020, cattle price forecasts are raised, reflecting current price strength and increased packer demand.  For 2021, cattle prices are also raised on expected continued strength of packer demand in the first part of the year.  The 2020 hog price forecast is reduced on current price weakness and increased supply pressure.  Broiler price forecasts are reduced for the remainder of the year while the turkey price forecast is raised slightly on higher second-quarter prices.  Egg price forecasts for 2020 are reduced on current price weakness and weaker demand.  The 2021 hog, broiler, turkey and egg price forecasts are unchanged from last month. Milk production for 2020 is raised from last month on higher expected cow numbers.  The fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher imports of butter fat products, while the fat basis export forecast is reduced on lower expected sales of cheese.  The 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is raised from last month on recent trade data and expectations of higher imports of a number of dairy products.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is raised primarily on higher skim milk powder and lactose exports.  Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are raised from the previous month on recent price strength and stronger anticipated demand.  The whey price forecast is lowered from last month. Class III and Class IV prices are raised for 2020.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $16.65 per cwt for 2020. The 2021 milk production forecast is raised from last month on higher expected cow numbers and stronger growth in milk per cow.  The fat basis import forecast is reduced while the export forecast is unchanged.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is reduced from the previous month while the export forecast is unchanged.  For 2021, cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk price forecasts are raised from the previous month while whey is lowered.  The 2021 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from last month.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $16.20 per cwt for 2021.COTTON:  The most significant revision to this month\u2019s U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates is a 200,000-bale decrease in 2019/20 mill use, to 2.5 million bales.  U.S. mill use in 2020/21 was also revised downward by 100,000 bales, and ending stocks are now projected at 7.3 million bales in 2019/20 and 8.0 million bales in 2020/21.  While the 43 percent stocks-use ratio projected for 2020/21 is marginally higher than the year before, and is substantially above recent levels, it would still be below the 55 percent ratio realized in 2007/08.The 2020/21 world cotton projections include slightly smaller production, reduced consumption, and higher beginning and ending stocks.  World ending stocks are 5.2 million bales higher this month, reflecting cuts to world consumption of slightly more than 2 million bales each in 2019/20 and 2020/21, and revised production estimates for Argentina starting with 2017/18 that added an additional 930,000 bales to stocks.  World production in 2020/21 is revised downward by 215,000 bales as higher production in Argentina and Tanzania is offset by reductions for Turkey, Uzbekistan, and some smaller countries.  World consumption in 2020/21 is revised downward due to changes in a number of countries, led by a 1-million-bale reduction in the forecast for China and a 500,000-bale reduction for India.  At nearly 105 million bales, world ending stocks in 2020/21 are expected to be their largest since 2014/15.",
    "November_2022": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean outlook for 2022/23 is for increased production, crush, and ending stocks.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.35 billion bushels, up 33 million on higher yields.  Higher yields in Iowa and Missouri account for most of the change in production.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels on an increased domestic soybean meal disappearance forecast.  With exports unchanged, soybean ending stocks are raised 20 million bushels to 220 million.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2022/23 is forecast at $14.00 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean oil price is also unchanged at 69 cents per pound.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $400.00 per short ton, up 10 dollars.Global oilseed production for 2022/23 is projected at 645.6 million tons, down 1.0 million from last month.  Lower soybean, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed production is partly offset by higher rapeseed.  Global soybean production is down 0.5 million tons to 390.5 million, mainly on lower production for Argentina.  Area harvested for Argentina is reduced reflecting in-country estimates.  Sunflowerseed production is reduced for Ukraine on lower reported yields.  Global rapeseed production is raised 1.0 million tons to 84.8 million on higher yields for Australia and the EU.Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 121.9 million tons, up 1.4 million.  Soybean stocks account for most of the change with an increase to China\u2019s stocks based on a revision to 2021/22 imports.  Another notable oilseed change includes lower palm oil production for Malaysia, which is reduced 1.0 million tons to 18.8 million.  With reduced Malaysian palm oil supply and no change in exports, ending stocks are lower.  SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply and use for 2021/22 is revised to incorporate complete fiscal year estimates in USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data (SMD).  Beet sugar production is estimated at 5.155 million short tons, raw value (STRV), an increase over last month of 77,618 due to more production in September than expected last month.  Louisiana cane sugar production is lowered by 58,824 STRV to 1.923 million on lower-than-expected production in September.  Along with small changes in some other components, deliveries for human consumption are lowered by 81,845 STRV to 12.470 million.  Most of this decrease is attributable to very low direct consumption imports in September.  The final year estimate of ending stocks is 1.814 million STRV.  This is 40,823 STRV more than last month and results in a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.3 percent.U.S. sugar supply in 2022/23 is lowered 196,055 STRV from last month on lower total production and imports only mildly offset by higher beginning stocks.  Beet sugar production is lowered 111,341 STRV to 4.994 million.  Beet processors reduced their forecast of sugarbeets available for slicing due to higher expected beet pile shrink.  An increase in cane sugar production partially offsets the beet sugar decline.  Florida production is increased 20,923 STRV to 1.989 million based on a higher sugarcane yield forecast by both processors and NASS.  Louisiana production is increased to 2.006 million STRV on increased area harvested and on adjustments made for September production.  Imports are reduced by 168,986 STRV mainly on lower imports from Mexico based on lower exportable supply (see below) that offsets a 25,000 STRV increase in high-tier tariff imports from raw sugar imported by a refiner in early November.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 25,000 STRV in line with the 2021/22 reduction.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.701 million STRV for ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2022/23 is the same as last month at 5.900 million metric tons (MT).  Area harvested is expected at about 800,000 hectares and yields are unchanged from last month.  Although good rainfall amounts came in September, they should have arrived earlier in the growing season, or at least by August, to have had a significant effect on production.  Total imports for combined use in consumption and IMMEX are lowered by 15,000 MT to more closely match imports recorded in 2021/22.  Strong deliveries for consumption in September pushed the total for 2021/22 to 4.113 million MT, an increase of 63,100 MT relative to last month.  Deliveries of high fructose corn syrup in 2021/22 amounted to 1.291 million MT, dry basis and this same amount is projected for 2022/23.  Per capita sweetener consumption for 2021/22 at 41.09 kilograms is carried forward to 2022/23 and implies sugar deliveries for consumption at 4.168 million MT.  This is a 117,598 MT increase over last month.  Deliveries for IMMEX for 2022/23 at 533,000 MT closely match the recorded total for 2021/22.  Ending stocks for 2022/23 at 979,291 MT provide enough sugar to meet use in 2023/24 before the start of the harvest campaign in November.  Exports are residually projected at 1.219 million MT, a decrease of 183,616.  Exports under license to the United States are reduced 166,020 MT and other exports are reduced 17,596 MT to zero.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher beef and broiler forecasts for the fourth quarter are partly offset by lower pork and turkey forecasts.  Beef production is raised with higher expected cattle slaughter as well as higher carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered on a slower expected pace of slaughter.  Broiler production is raised on current slaughter and hatchery data.  Turkey production is lowered based on tighter bird supplies.  Egg production is lowered from last month on recent hatchery data.For 2023, the beef forecast is lowered on tighter supplies of fed cattle and lower cow slaughter.  Broiler production is raised on expected growth in broiler flocks.  Turkey production is lowered slightly for the first two quarters.  Egg production is reduced as slower expected growth in production in late 2022 is carried into the first part of 2023. Beef imports for 2022 are lowered on recent data, higher expected U.S. cow slaughter, and weaker expected imports from Oceania in the fourth quarter.  Exports are lowered on recent data and expected weaker exports to Asian markets.  No changes are made to beef trade for 2023.  Pork imports are lowered and exports are raised for 2022 on observed data.  Weaker imports are carried through into 2023, but exports are unchanged.  Broiler export forecasts for 2022 are raised on recent trade data while 2023 exports are unchanged.  Turkey exports are raised for 2022 and 2023 on current trade data.  Cattle price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on stronger expected demand.  The 2022 hog price forecast is raised on prices to date; 2023 prices are unchanged.  The broiler price forecast for 2022 is lowered on recent data, but 2023 forecasts are unchanged.  Turkey price forecasts for both 2022 and 2023 are raised with lowered expected production.  Egg price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on recent prices and expectations of continued firm demand. The milk production forecast for 2022 is raised from last month, while 2023 production is unchanged.  The dairy cow inventory for both years is lowered on recent published data but output per cow is raised.  Fat and skim-solids basis imports for 2022 are lowered, driven by recent trade data and lower expected imports of cheese and butterfat products.  Forecasts for 2023 fat basis imports are lowered on weaker butterfat products, while skim-solids basis imports are raised on cheese.  Exports on a fat basis for 2022 are lowered on weaker expected exports of cheese and butterfat products but raised for 2023.  Exports on a skim-solids basis are raised in 2022 on higher expected exports of skim milk powders (SMP) and lactose and for 2023 on higher SMP and whey exports.For 2022, forecasts for butter, cheese, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are lowered on current prices and larger milk supplies.  Whey prices are unchanged.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are lowered on weaker product prices.  For 2023, the price forecast for butter is raised, but lowered for cheese and NDM.  Whey prices are unchanged.  With lower cheese and NDM prices, Class III and Class IV price forecasts are lowered.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is lowered to $25.50 per cwt and the 2023 all milk price is lowered to $22.60 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2022/23 U.S. cotton balance sheet shows slightly higher production and higher ending stocks this month.  Production is 1.5 percent higher, at 14.0 million bales, as a decrease in the Southwest is more than offset by increases elsewhere.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged, and ending stocks are 200,000 bales higher at 3.0 million bales or 20 percent of use.  The 2022/23 season average price for upland cotton is reduced 5 cents this month to 85 cents per pound.This month\u2019s 2022/23 global cotton balance sheet includes lower production, consumption, trade and ending stocks.  Production is down 1.6 million bales from last month, led by a 700,000-bale cut in Pakistan\u2019s crop as gin arrivals there signal the extent of damage from earlier precipitation and flooding.  Unusually high precipitation is also driving a 500,000-bale reduction in Australia\u2019s 2022/23 crop, and in part accounts for a 630,000-bale decline in West Africa\u2019s expected output.  Global cotton consumption is projected 650,000 bales lower this month, with a 300,000-bale cut to mill use in both Pakistan and Bangladesh.  World trade is 400,000 bales lower, with import reductions for Bangladesh and China only partly offset by Pakistan\u2019s increase; West African exporters account for most of the decline in projected exports.  At 87.3 million bales, world ending stocks in 2022/23 are projected 600,000 bales lower than in October, but 1.6 million higher than the year before.  ",
    "June_2021": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2021/22 include higher beginning and ending stocks.  Higher beginning stocks reflect a lower crush forecast for 2020/21.  Soybean crush for 2020/21 is reduced 15 million bushels to 2.175 billion based on a lower forecast for soybean meal domestic disappearance and higher soybean meal imports.  Soybean oil exports for 2020/21 are reduced 400 million pounds to 1.9 billion as high U.S. prices reduce competitiveness in the world market.  Conversely, soybean oil domestic disappearance is increased 225 million pounds, reflecting strong consumption to date.  With higher soybean beginning stocks and no use changes for 2021/22, ending stocks are projected at 155 million bushels, up 15 million from last month.  The 2021/22 season-average soybean and product price forecasts are unchanged this month.The 2021/22 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is forecast up 0.6 million tons to 632.9 million, with higher canola production partly offset by lower cottonseed.  EU canola production is increased 0.6 million to 17.2 million as cool spring weather coupled with timely May rainfall boosted yield prospects particularly for France, Germany, and Poland.  Australian canola production is also revised up 0.2 million tons to 3.7 million on higher area harvested and yield.   Global 2021/22 soybean ending stocks are raised 1.5 million tons to 92.6 million, driven by higher beginning stocks for the United States and Brazil.  Brazil\u2019s 2020/21 soybean production is raised 1.0 million tons to 137.0 million, mainly on higher yields for Mato Grosso do Sul.  Another notable oilseed change includes a 0.5-million-ton reduction to 18.5 million for Malaysian 2020/21 palm oil production due to lower-than-expected recent monthly output.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supplies for 2020/21 are decreased by 50,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) on lower re-export imports.  Re-export imports for 2020/21 are estimated at 250,000 STRV and are lowered on the basis of the pace to date.  There are no other changes, implying that beginning stocks for 2021/22 are lower by the 50,000-STRV amount.  There are no other changes to supply or use for 2021/22.  With no announcement on the 2021/22 U.S. additional specialty TRQ, total TRQ imports are still at minimum levels consistent with WTO and FTA bindings.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 1.452 million for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 11.84 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2020/21 is estimated at 5.200 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 125,000 due to a campaign cut short by an early onset of seasonal rains in several regional production areas.  Exports other than those to the United States under the Suspension Agreement provisions are reduced by the 125,000-MT amount, leaving ending stocks unchanged at 910,417 MT.  There are no changes to Mexico supply or use for 2021/22. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2021 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher forecast beef, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets lower pork production.  The increase in beef production is small as higher expected cow slaughter is largely offset by lower steer and heifer slaughter.  Pork production is lowered as higher expected slaughter is more than offset by lower carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is raised primarily on higher production in the second quarter while turkey production is raised on hatchery data and a more rapid pace of slaughter.  Egg production is raised from the previous month on recent hatchery data.  The 2022 red meat and poultry production forecast is little changed from last month with only a slight increase in turkey production due to expected improvement in turkey prices. The beef import forecast is raised for 2021 and 2022 on expected strength in demand for processing beef.  Exports for both years are raised on expected firm demand from Asian markets.  Pork export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised from the previous month as demand in several markets has strengthened.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts for 2021 are raised on recent trade data; no change is made to 2022.For 2021, cattle, hog, and turkey price forecasts are raised, reflecting current price strength.  Hog and turkey prices are also raised for the first quarter of 2022.  Broiler and egg price forecasts are reduced for second quarter 2021 based on current prices; no changes are made to prices in the outlying quarters.  Milk production for 2021 is raised from last month on higher expected cow numbers.  The fat basis import forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower expected imports of butterfat containing products, while the skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged.  Exports on both fat and skims-solids bases are raised from last month.  Fat basis export increases are underpinned largely by higher shipments of butterfat-containing products and cheese, while skim-solids increases primarily reflect stronger expected cheese, lactose, and whey shipments.  Price forecasts for butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey are raised from the previous month on recent price strength and stronger anticipated demand.  The cheese price forecast is lowered from last month on relatively large stocks and current prices.  The lower forecast cheese price results in a lower Class III price, but the higher NDM and butter prices support result in a higher Class IV price.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $18.85 per cwt for 2021. The 2022 milk production forecast is raised from last month as higher forecast cow numbers for 2021 carry into 2022.  Import forecasts are unchanged.  The fat basis export forecast is unchanged, but the skim-solids export forecast is increased on expected strength in whey exports.  For 2022, butter, NDM, and whey price forecasts are raised from the previous month while the cheese price is unchanged.  Thus, Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from last month.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $18.75 per cwt for 2022.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton projections for 2021/22 show a 100,000-bale increase in exports from last month, to 14.8 million bales, as stronger than expected late-season 2020/21 shipments extend past July 31.  U.S. 2021/22 production and consumption are unchanged from last month, and with lower beginning stocks and higher exports, ending stocks are now 200,000 bales lower, at 2.9 million.  The upland cotton farm price for 2021/22 is unchanged, at 75 cents per pound, while the 2020/21 price is reduced 1 cent to 67 cents per pound.Global ending stocks in 2021/22 are also projected lower this month, down 1.7 million bales to 89.3 million.  Beginning stocks are slightly lower as a 625,000-bale increase in 2020/21 consumption more than offsets higher estimated supplies.  Consumption is also higher for 2021/22, up 1.1 million bales, as increases for China, Bangladesh, and Turkey offset a lower forecast for India.  Global cotton production in 2021/22 is 570,000 bales lower this month, led by a 750,000-bale reduction in China following recent surveys indicating lower than expected area in Southern Xinjiang.  World trade is 1.1 million bales higher, with increased imports for China, Bangladesh, and Turkey.  Expected exports are higher this month for Brazil, Australia, and Tanzania, as well as the United States.",
    "July_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2021/22 is projected at 130.5 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month, with increases for sunflowerseed, peanuts, and cottonseed partly offset with a reduction for canola.  Soybean production is projected at 4.4 billion bushels, unchanged from last month.  Harvested area, forecast at 86.7 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is unchanged from last month but up 4.4 million from last year.  The soybean yield forecast is unchanged at 50.8 bushels per acre.  Soybean supply and use forecasts are unchanged from last month.Soybean changes for 2020/21 include lower imports, crush, and exports.  With offsetting changes in supply and use, ending stocks are unchanged at 135 million bushels.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $11.05 per bushel, down $0.20 as early-season sales at lower prices continue to weigh on the season-average forecast.  The soybean meal price is projected at $395.00 per short ton, down $10.00 from last month.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 57.5 cents per pound, down 1.5 cents.The 2021/22 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, crush, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is raised 2.5 million tons to 635.4 million, with higher sunflowerseed, rapeseed, cottonseed, and peanuts partly offset by lower soybean output.  Russian sunflowerseed production is increased 2.0 million tons to 16.5 million, mainly on higher area shown in government planting progress reports.  Australian rapeseed production is raised on beneficial early-season rainfall and higher area.  Canadian canola production is lowered as early-season drought conditions impact yields and offset an increase to area.  Canada\u2019s soybean production is also lowered based on lower area.The 2021/22 global soybean ending stocks are increased 1.9 million tons to 94.5 million as higher stocks for Brazil and Argentina are partly offset by lower Chinese stocks.  The stocks revisions reflect notable balance sheet changes for Brazil and Argentina in 2020/21 and China in 2020/21 and 2021/22.  Exports for Brazil and Argentina for 2020/21 are reduced as high prices lead to lower shipments to China.  China\u2019s imports are reduced 2 million tons to 98 million and 1 million tons to 102 million for 2020/21 and 2021/22, respectively.  Another notable oilseed change includes a 0.3-million-ton reduction to 18.2 million for Malaysian 2020/21 palm oil production.SUGAR:  High-tier tariff sugar imports for 2019/20 and 2020/21 have been corrected due to a discovery of errors in the labelling of data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (CENSUS).  The CENSUS data, which USDA uses to identify high-tier tariff imports, were correct through the month of June 2020 but have been incorrect since July 2020.  With the assistance of USDA, CENSUS staff have identified the problem and are in the process of correcting the data.  Revised import estimates will be published as soon as practicable.  In the meantime, USDA is using non-public estimates of high-tier tariff imports as compiled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in their ACE database.  These data since July 2020 through May 2021 will be published by FAS shortly after the release of the July 2021 WASDE.  Sweetener Market Data (SMD) for imports and deliveries by non-reporters are revised for both 2019/20 and 2020/21.  Imports for 2019/20 are decreased by 92,042 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.143 million.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are reduced by the same amount to 12.224 million STRV.  Although there is no change to SMD survey-based ending stocks, the ending stocks-to-use ratio for 2019/20 is increased by 0.1 percentage points to 13.0 percent because of lower use.SUGAR:  High-tier tariff sugar imports for 2019/20 and 2020/21 have been corrected due to a discovery of errors in the labelling of data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (CENSUS).

Sweetener Market Data (SMD) for imports and deliveries by non-reporters are revised for both 2019/20 and 2020/21.  Imports for 2019/20 are decreased by 92,042 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.143 million.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are reduced by the same amount to 12.224 million STRV.  Although there is no change to SMD survey-based ending stocks, the ending stocks-to-use ratio for 2019/20 is increased by 0.1 percentage points to 13.0 percent because of lower use.U.S. sugar production for 2021/22 is decreased by 302,422 STRV to 9.008 million.  Beet sugar production is projected lower by 192,422 STRV due to a reduction from last month of projected yield in the Upper Midwest on processors\u2019 reporting and a lower U.S. area harvested forecast in the NASS Acreage report.  Florida cane sugar is decreased by 85,000 STRV on processors\u2019 reporting of a reduction from last month in forecast area harvested.  Louisiana cane sugar production is decreased by 25,000 on lower sugarcane yields forecast by processors.  Beet sugar production for 2020/21 is decreased slightly by lower estimated recovery only partially offset by an increase in estimated sugarbeet production in California.  The Florida 2020/21 campaign ran late through the beginning of June and is estimated at 2.091 million STRV.  The length of the campaign contributed to reduced area for the succeeding campaign in 2021/22.Imports for 2020/21 are increased by 34,093 STRV to 3.138 million STRV.  TRQ imports for 2020/21 are estimated at 1.778 million STRV on the basis of the 44,093 STRV increase in the additional specialty TRQ and an additional 60,000 STRV of raw sugar expected to enter after the reallocation by USTR of the raw sugar TRQ shortfall.  Shortfall is now estimated at 86,854 STRV, down from 146,854 last month.  Partially offsetting these increases are pace-to-date reductions to re-export imports (50,000 STRV reduction) and high-tier tariff sugar imports resulting from ACE sourcing (20,000 STRV reduction).  Imports for 2021/22 are increased by 484,000 STRV due to an expected increase in imports from Mexico.  There are no changes to use for either 2020/21 or 2021/22.  Even with downward revisions made for 2020/21 direct consumption imports due to lower high-tier tariff sugar imports, the pace of overall deliveries appears consistent with an unchanged 12.125 million STRV.  Deliveries for 2021/22 are still expected to be flat.  All changes for 2020/21 imply an additional 21,522 STRV in ending stocks for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.49 percent.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 1.656 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.50 percent. Mexico production for 2020/21 is estimated at 5.708 million metric tons (MT).  The campaign is nearly over with only one mill in operation as of July 3.  The projection for 2021/22 production is unchanged at 5.809 million MT.  Deliveries for IMMEX for 2020/21 are increased by 13,000 MT to 428,000 on the pace to date and the projection for 2021/22 is correspondingly increased by the same amount.  Required ending stocks to meet delivery needs for the 2.5 months before the start of the 2021/22 sugarcane campaign are increased slightly because of the 2021/22 increase for IMMEX.  These small changes imply slightly lower exports for both 2020/21 and 2021/22.  Exports to the United States for 2021/22 are increased to 1.240 million MT on calculated U.S. Needs implied by the July 2021 WASDE as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements.  Residually determined exports to other destinations are projected at 271,088 MT.Mexico production for 2020/21 is estimated at 5.708 million metric tons (MT).

Residually determined exports to other destinations are projected at 271,088 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2021 red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month on lower pork, broiler, and turkey forecasts.  The beef production forecast is unchanged as higher slaughter is offset by lower expected carcass weights.  Pork production is reduced on lower expected second-half commercial hog slaughter.  Broiler and turkey production are lowered on the pace of production in the second quarter.  However, the forecasts for the remainder of the year are unchanged.  The egg production forecast is lowered from last month on recent production and flock data.For 2022, the red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered, primarily on lower pork production as well as slightly lower beef production.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated producers expect to farrow fewer sows in the second half of 2021 which, when coupled with slower forecast growth in pigs per litter, will tighten supplies of market-ready hogs in 2022 relative to last month.  USDA will release the Cattle report on July 23, which will provide an indication of the mid-year inventory and producer intentions for heifer retention.  Broiler, turkey, and egg forecasts are unchanged from last month.Beef import forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are unchanged from last month while the export forecasts are raised for both years on continued firm demand in Asia.  Pork import and export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are unchanged.  Broiler exports for 2021 are raised primarily on higher-than-expected May data, but no change is made to the forecasts for 2022.  The turkey export forecast is raised slightly for 2021 on current trade data; the forecast for 2022 is unchanged. Cattle price forecasts for 2021 are raised on the strength of recent prices; no change is made to the annual 2022 price.  The 2021 hog price forecast is reduced on current price weakness, but the price forecast for 2022 is unchanged as tighter supplies during the year, relative to last month, are expected to help support prices.  The broiler price forecast for 2021 is raised on slightly higher expected third-quarter prices; no change is made to the 2022 broiler price.  Turkey price forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised on improving demand.  The 2021 and 2022 egg price forecasts are reduced on current price weakness.Milk production forecast for 2021 is lowered from last month as slower-expected growth in milk per cow more than offsets higher forecast cow numbers.  However, the 2022 milk production forecast is raised from last month on higher cow numbers.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, to be released on July 23rd, will provide a mid-year estimate of the dairy cow inventory and producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for dairy cow replacement.Imports on both fat and skim-solids bases are raised for 2021 and 2022 on stronger expected imports of cheese and butterfat containing products.  Exports on a skim-solids basis are also raised for 2021 and 2022, reflecting stronger exports of whey, skim/nonfat dry milk powder, and lactose.  Fat basis exports are unchanged from last month. For 2021, cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are lowered from last month on relatively high stocks and weaker-than-previously-expected demand.  As a result, Class III and Class IV prices are lowered. The 2021 all milk price forecast is lowered to $18.30 per cwt.  For 2022, price forecasts for cheese and butter are lowered on larger expected stocks and higher production, but price forecasts for NDM and whey are unchanged.  With lower cheese and butter prices, Class III and Class IV price forecasts are reduced and the 2022 all milk price forecast is lowered to $18.50 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2021/22 cotton projections show higher production, exports, and ending stocks compared with last month.  While the June 30 Acreage report shows 300,000 fewer planted acres for U.S. cotton than NASS\u2019s previous survey, a rainfall-driven reduction in projected Texas abandonment means U.S. harvested area is projected 9 percent higher.  While 2021/22 production is 800,000 bales higher, consumption is unchanged, and exports and ending stocks are each projected 400,000 bales higher.  The upland cotton farm price for 2021/22 is unchanged, at 75 cents per pound, while the 2020/21 price is reduced one half cent to 66.5 cents per pound.World 2021/22 ending stocks of cotton are projected 1.6 million bales lower than in June as largely offsetting changes in production and consumption do little to offset lower estimated beginning stocks.  Beginning stocks are 1.5 million bales lower, largely due to reduced 2020/21 Brazilian and Indian production and higher Indian consumption.  World production in 2021/22 is projected about 500,000 bales higher this month as a larger U.S. crop more than offsets a 300,000-bale decline for Pakistan.  Consumption is slightly more than 600,000 bales higher largely due to an increase for India.  World trade is projected 670,000 bales lower, with China\u2019s imports 1 million lower and Brazil\u2019s exports 1.1 million bales lower.",
    "November_2020": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean outlook for 2020/21 is for lower production and ending stocks.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.17 billion bushels, down 98 million on lower yields.  Lower yields are reported for several major producing states, including Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, and Nebraska.  With reduced production, soybean ending stocks are projected at 190 million bushels, down 100 million from last month.  If realized, soybean ending stocks would be at the lowest level in the past seven years.Soybean and product prices for 2020/21 are all higher this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $10.40 per bushel, up 60 cents.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $355.00 per short ton, up $20.00.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 34.5 cents per pound, up 2.0 cents from last month.The 2020/21 foreign oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production and crush, resulting in lower exports of oilseed meals and vegetable oil.  Foreign oilseed production is lowered 5.6 million tons to 473.3 million, mainly on lower soybean crops for Argentina and India and lower sunflowerseed production for Ukraine and Russia.  Yields are reduced for Ukraine and Russia on dry weather conditions during the season and recent harvest results.  Argentina\u2019s soybean production is lowered as economic uncertainty reduces area expansion.  Crop reductions result in lower exports of soybean and sunflowerseed meal and oil.  Foreign oilseed stocks are increased slightly as lower cottonseed, sunflowerseed, and peanut stocks are offset by higher soybean stocks.  Foreign soybean stocks are increased mainly on 2019/20 revisions to imports and crush for China and Argentina, respectively.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is decreased 440,781 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 13.649 million on lower beginning stocks, on decreased production, and on lower-than-expected imports from the 2019/20 raw sugar TRQ that had been extended to October 31.  Beginning stocks reported by processors and refineries came in at 1.623 million STRV, down from last month by 78,492 on final fiscal year (FY) 2019/20 supply, use, and stocks estimates published in USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data for November.  Production of beet sugar for 2020/21 is reduced by 306,820 STRV to 4.899 million.  NASS forecasts 2020/21 sugarbeet production at 33.958 million tons on a national yield of 29.6 that is 5.18 percent lower than last month.  The yield in the Upper Midwest at 25.66 tons/acre is 9.66 percent lower than last month and Michigan at 28.30 tons/acre is 3.09 percent lower.  Beet sugar production for FY 2020/21 is lowered further on a record level of August-September production for 2020/21 crop year (764,645 STRV) that is only partially offset by an increase in projected August-September 2021 production from an average of the five previous years (664,608 STRV).  Louisiana cane sugar for 2020/21 is increased 39,668 STRV to 1.824 million, based mostly on less production in September 2020 (70,415 STRV) counted in FY 2019/20 than projected last month (120,000 STRV).  Projected September 2021 production is 44,837 STRV on the five-year average, down from 54,754 projected last month.  Imports for 2020/21 are down 95,137 STRV to 3.025 million.  Raw sugar 2019/20 TRQ entering in October 2020 is estimated at 151,898 STRV. This is 120,136 STRV less than projected last month.  Partially offsetting is an increase of 25,000 STRV in high-tier tariff imports.  There are no changes to 2020/21 use.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected residually at 1.309 million implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 10.60 percent Mexico sugar production for 2020/21 is projected at 5.950 million metric tons (MT), a decrease of 50,000 from last month.  This projection adapts the sugarcane yield (67.18 MT/hectare) and recovery (11.27 percent) recently published by CONADESUCA from its first estimate of the crop but projects area harvested at 785,000 hectares, close to that realized in 2019/20.  Beginning stocks are up 6,006 MT on final data for 2019/20 published by CONADESUCA.  With no change to ending stocks, the change in projected supply flows into a reduction of 46,994 MT in exports to non-U.S. destinations. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2020 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month on higher beef, pork, and broiler production.  Beef production is raised from the previous month on higher expected slaughter of both fed and non-fed cattle.  The pork production forecast is raised on a more rapid pace of slaughter.  The broiler production forecast is raised on higher expected production for the fourth quarter.  Turkey production is virtually unchanged as higher production in the third quarter largely offsets a lower fourth-quarter forecast.  Egg production is reduced as lower reported table egg production in the third quarter more than offsets higher hatching egg production.  For 2021, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from last month as higher expected broiler production more than offsets lower forecast pork production.  Broiler production is raised from the previous month, but higher feed costs are expected to temper production growth.  The pork production forecast is reduced slightly on higher feed costs.  Beef and turkey production forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The 2020 egg production forecast is raised from last month on higher expected hatching egg production.The 2020 beef export forecast is raised on stronger expected demand from major trading partners while imports are adjusted to reflect third quarter reported data, but no change is made to the fourth-quarter forecast.  The pork import forecast is raised from the previous month while exports are reduced on third-quarter trade data.  For 2021, beef and pork trade forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  The 2020 and 2021 broiler export forecasts are raised from last month on stronger expected international demand.  The 2020 turkey forecast is raised from last month on higher September exports and expectations of slightly higher exports through the remainder of the year; the 2021 forecast remains unchanged. The 2020 and 2021 cattle price forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The hog price forecast is reduced for fourth-quarter 2020 on recent price weakness; no change is made to the 2021 hog price forecasts.  The 2020 broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised from the previous month on current prices, but no changesare made to 2021 prices.  The 2020 and 2021 egg price forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  The milk production forecasts for 2020 and 2021 are raised from the previous month on stronger growth in milk per cow and higher expected dairy cow inventory.  The 2020 fat basis import forecast is raised on recent trade data and higher expected imports of cheese and butterfat products in the fourth quarter.  This strength is expected to carry into 2021 supporting a higher 2021 fat basis import forecast.  The fat basis export forecast for 2020 is raised on higher expected exports of cheese and butterfat; no change is made to the 2021 fat basis export forecast.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2020 is reduced on lower imports of low-fat milk powders while the 2021 import forecast is reduced on lower imports of a number of dairy products.  The 2020 and 2021 skim-solids basis export forecasts are raised on stronger expected sales of skim milk powder.  Cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts for 2020 are raised from last month on strength in demand.  The butter price forecast for 2020 is reduced on current and expected continued weakness in prices.  The 2020 Class III price forecast is raised on higher prices for cheese and whey.  The Class IV price forecast is unchanged from last month as the higher NDM price offsets the lower butter price.  The 2020 all-milk price forecast is raised to $18.25 per cwt.For 2021, cheese, NDM, and whey price forecasts are raised on continued strength in demand.  The butter price forecast is reduced on lower expected prices through the first part of the year.  The 2021 Class III price forecast is raised on higher forecast prices for cheese and whey.  The Class IV price forecast is reduced as the lowered butter price more than offsets the increase in NDM.  The all milk price forecast for 2021 is raised to $17.70 per cwt. COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. cotton estimates are virtually unchanged from October.  The U.S. production forecast is marginally higher, at 17.1 million bales, while domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  U.S. ending stocks remain at 7.2 million bales and, at 42 percent of use, would be the highest stocks-to-use ratio since 2007/08.  The marketing-year average price received by upland producers is forecast at 64.0 cents per pound, 5 percent (3 cents) above the October forecast, and 7 percent higher than 2019/20\u2019s price of 59.6 cents.World 2020/21 cotton production is projected marginally lower than in October, but with slightly higher beginning stocks and slightly lower use, global ending stocks are up 300,000 bales from the previous month.  Global 2020/21 beginning stocks are forecast 378,000 bales higher this month, largely reflecting an increase in Brazil\u2019s 2019/20 crop.  Production changes for 2020/21 include an 800,000-bale reduction for Pakistan, a 400,000-bale increase for Australia, and a 250,000-bale increase for China.  Smaller, offsetting changes occurred in estimates for Central Asia, and the global total is 160,000 bales lower than in October.  World cotton use is also projected 160,000 bales lower this month, largely reflecting expected lower mill consumption in Pakistan.  World trade is projected 605,000 bales higher this month as Pakistan\u2019s imports increase in response to the smaller crop, with Brazil and Australia export estimates higher as well.  ",
    "September_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 93.2 million tons, down 3 million from last month due to lower soybean, cottonseed, and peanut production.  Soybean production is projected at 3.149 billion bushels, down 106 million due to lower yield prospects, especially in the western Corn Belt.  The soybean yield is forecast at 41.2 bushels per acre, down 1.4 from last month.  Soybean exports are reduced 15 million bushels to 1.37 billion reflecting reduced supplies and increased competition from South America.  Soybean crush is reduced 20 million bushels to 1.655 billion reflecting lower projected soybean meal exports and domestic soybean meal consumption.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 150 million bushels, down 70 million.  Other changes for 2013/14 include reduced soybean oil production and exports.  The 2012/13 supply and demand estimates include a 5-million-bushel increase in soybean imports to a record 40 million and a 5-million-bushel increase in crush.  Ending stocks remain unchanged at 125 million bushels. The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $11.50 to $13.50 per bushel, up $1.15 on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $360 to $400 per short ton, up $55.00 at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 43 to 47 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint as large global vegetable oil supplies pressure prices.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 495.1 million tons, up 2 million from last month.  Gains in foreign production more than offset lower forecasts for the United States.  Global soybean production is projected almost unchanged at a record 281.7 million tons as larger crop forecasts for Brazil and Paraguay mostly offset reductions for the United States, Canada, China, and Russia.  Soybean production for Brazil is forecast at a record 88 million tons, up 3 million on increased area.  Recent price strength and a weaker real are expected to provide incentives for soybean producers to increase area by 4 percent from last year.  Soybean production for China is reduced 0.3 million tons to 12.2 million on lower yields resulting from excess rainfall and flooding in the northeast.  If realized, this would be China\u2019s smallest soybean harvest since 1992/93.  Global sunflowerseed production is raised 1.4 million tons to a record 41.8 million on higher forecasts for Ukraine and the European Union.  Record production is forecast for Ukraine as favorable rainfall and temperatures in August and early September improved Ukraine yield prospects.  Other changes include higher rapeseed and sunflowerseed production for the European Union, higher peanut production for India, and higher cottonseed production for Brazil and India.Little change is expected for global soybean trade in 2013/14 as lower exports for the United States and Argentina are offset by higher exports by Brazil and Paraguay.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 81.2 million tons, up 0.5 million as gains for rapeseed and sunflowerseed more than offset lower soybean stocks.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is increased 328,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, as higher production and imports more than offset lower beginning stocks.  Projected sugar production is up 250,000 tons, based on higher forecast sugar crop yields.  Higher imports account for additional refined specialty sugar announced in the 2013/14 tariff rate quota (TRQ) and lower projected TRQ shortfall.  With higher domestic production and TRQ entries, projected imports from Mexico are reduced. Total use is increased in line with the increase in 2012/13 use.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are increased to 19.5 percent of use, compared with 16.9 percent last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2013 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  Beef production is raised in 2013 on greater cow and bull slaughter.  The pork production forecast for 2013 is raised as lower hog slaughter in the second half is more than offset by heavier average carcass weights.  Both broiler and turkey production are raised for 2013 based on the strength of production and hatchery data to date.  Egg production is unchanged.  For 2014, the total red meat and poultry forecast is reduced.  The beef production forecast is raised as higher second-half production increases more than offset a reduced first-half forecast.  Placements are lowered for the third and fourth quarters in 2013 but raised for first-quarter 2014 as more cattle are kept on pasture and winter wheat for placement early next year.  Partly offsetting the increase in later-year marketings and relatively high early-year cow slaughter is a small reduction in carcass weights.  Pork production is unchanged for 2014.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 27, providing an indication of producer farrowing intentions into early 2014.  For 2014, broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced as soybean meal prices are forecast higher and turkey returns remain under pressure through the early part of the year.  The egg production forecast is lowered for 2014 as table egg production growth will be dampened by higher soybean meal prices.Beef imports are reduced for 2013 based on the current pace of imports with a reduced forecast carried through 2014.  Global beef supplies are tight and demand by competing importers is expected to limit growth in U.S. imports.  Beef exports are higher for 2013 based on the strength of shipments to date.  The forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Pork exports are raised for both years as export demand to countries in Asia and North America continues to be strong.  The 2013 broiler export forecast is reduced as recent exports lagged expectations, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Turkey exports are unchanged for 2013 but lowered for 2014.Cattle prices for 2013 and 2014 are unchanged from last month.  Hog prices for both 2013 and 2014 are unchanged from last month.  The broiler price forecast for 2013 is lowered based on current price weakness.  The forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  The turkey price forecast is reduced for 2013 on relatively weak demand and slightly higher production, but 2014 is unchanged from last month with slower forecast production growth.  Egg prices are forecast higher for 2013, reflecting current prices; the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.The 2013 milk production forecast is reduced from last month, reflecting recent slower growth in milk production.  The production forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  For 2013 fat basis and skim-solids imports are lowered slightly from last month.  Exports are raised for 2013 and carried into 2014 on strong international demand for dairy products.  With forecast export demand, fat and skim-basis ending stocks are reduced in 2013 and 2014.Product price forecasts are mostly higher, with strong export demand and tightening supplies supporting increases for nonfat dry milk (NDM), butter and cheese prices in 2013 and 2014.  The whey price forecast is unchanged for 2013 but raised for 2014.  With increased product prices, Class III and Class IV price forecasts for 2013 and 2014 are higher.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.70 to $19.90 per cwt for 2013 and $19.35 to $20.35 per cwt for 2014. COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2013/14 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates include marginally lower production and lower exports compared to last month, resulting in a slight increase in ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are raised 100,000 bales to 3.9 million based on revised stocks data for July 31, 2013.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are lowered 200,000 bales due to increased competition for market share, mainly from India.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average price received by producers is lowered 3 cents on each end to 69 to 85 cents per pound, reflecting recent market activity and prospects.The world 2013/14 cotton supply and demand estimates show higher ending stocks resulting mainly from increased production.  Production is raised 1.0 million bales, based on improved crop prospects for India, Brazil, and Greece, partially offset by reductions for the United States and Syria.  A small net decrease in global consumption includes reductions for India and South Africa, partially offset by increases for Indonesia and Turkey.  Higher estimated world trade reflects increases in both imports and exports for India, as well as higher imports for Indonesia and Turkey.  The China balance sheet is largely unchanged this month, based on currently announced reserve purchase, release, and import quota policies for 2013/14.",
    "November_2021": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean outlook for 2021/22 is for lower production and exports, and higher ending stocks.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.42 billion bushels, down 23 million on lower yields.  Lower yields in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, and Kansas account for most of the change in production.  Exports are reduced this month reflecting reduced global imports and lower-than-expected shipments through October.  With use falling more than supply, soybean ending stocks are raised 20 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $12.10 per bushel, down 25 cents.  Soybean meal and oil prices are unchanged at $325.00 per short ton and 65.0 cents per pound, respectively.Global 2021/22 soybean production is reduced 1.1 million tons to 384.0 million as lower production for the United States and Argentina is partly offset by higher Indian production.  Argentina\u2019s production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 49.5 million on a lower harvested area.  Production for India is raised 0.9 million tons to 11.9 million based on data from the Soybean Processors Association of India.  Global soybean exports are lowered 1.0 million tons to 172.1 million, with lower exports for Argentina and the United States partly offset by higher exports for Brazil and India.  With lower exports, China\u2019s imports are reduced 1.0 million tons to 100 million.  Global soybean stocks are reduced 0.8 million tons to 103.8 million as lower stocks for Argentina and China are partly offset by higher U.S. stocks.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2020/21 is increased by 60,682 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.092 million on higher-than-expected beet sugar production in September.  Beet sugar production for 2021/22 is increased by 65,544 STRV to 5.413 million on processors\u2019 forecast of beet sugar production from slicing (increase of 112,372 STRV) less adjustments made for August-September production in 2021 and projected 2022 (decrease of 46,829 STRV).  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is decreased by 20,021 STRV on a lower crop yield forecast by NASS, a slightly lower sucrose recovery forecast by processors, and adjustments made for September production in 2021 and 2022.Imports for 2020/21 are reduced by 56,719 STRV to 3.195 million on final trade data for September 2021 from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Census.  On October 29, 2021 the USDA extended the period for the entry of 2020/21 raw cane TRQ sugar to December 31, 2021, and on November 3, USTR announced a reallocation of 29,442 metric tons, raw value from countries stating they do not intend to export their assigned quota.  It is estimated that an additional 19,842 STRV will enter as a consequence of these two actions.  The 2020/21 raw sugar shortfall decreases from 74,957 STRV last month to 55,116.  High-tier tariff imports for 2021/22 are increased by 25,000 STRV after the importation of high-tier tariff raw sugar in October by a major U.S. refiner.Sugar use for 2021/22 is unchanged from last month but is reduced for 2020/21 by 55,863 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2020/21 are estimated at 12.109 million STRV, a decrease of 90,835 and arguably attributable to challenges faced by refiners after Hurricane Ida.  Cane sugar deliveries for September were 9.4 percent below the average of the previous 5 years and at the lowest level since 2011/12.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are reported in Sweetener Market Data at 1,728,209 STRV for an ending stocks-to ratio of 14.0 percent.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are residually projected at 1,765,294 STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.3 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2021/22 is projected at 5.979 million metric tons (MT), an increase of 39,000 over last month due to good moisture in most growing areas.  The USDA forecast is about 137,500 MT less than the CONADESUCA forecast made by authorities in Mexico due mainly to differing forecasts of factory yields.  Deliveries for 2021/22 are down from last month by 13,962 MT on a continuing decline in human consumption only partially offset by increased deliveries to the IMMEX program for the export of sugar-containing products.  Ending stocks are reduced by only a small amount needed to meet use in 2022/23 before the start of sugar production in mid-November of 2022.  Exports are residually increased by 99,314 MT to 1.777 million. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2021 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  Beef production is raised from the previous month on higher expected slaughter of fed cattle and heavier carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is raised slightly as heavier carcass weights more than offset lower expected slaughter in the fourth quarter.  The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery and slaughter data.  Turkey production is raised on September production data; no change is made to the fourth quarter production forecast.  The egg production forecast is raised on recent production data and higher expected table egg production in the fourth quarter.For 2022, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised slightly from last month.  Beef and turkey production forecasts are raised, while the pork and broiler production forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The egg production forecast is raised from last month.The 2021 and 2022 beef import forecasts are raised from last month on robust domestic demand for beef.  The 2021 beef export forecast is raised on recent trade data and continued strong demand from top trading partners.  No change is made to the 2022 beef export forecast.  Pork exports are reduced on September trade data; no change is made to the forecasts for outlying periods.  Broiler export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised on stronger expected demand.  The 2021 and 2022 turkey export forecasts are raised modestly from last month.Cattle price forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised on continued firm demand.  The hog price forecast is reduced for fourth-quarter 2021 on recent price weakness.  This weakness is expected to carry into first-quarter 2022, and the annual price forecast is lowered.  The 2021 and 2022 broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised from the previous month on current prices and expected strength in demand. The milk production forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced from the previous month on lower expected dairy cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis import forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced on lower expected imports of butterfat products.  Fat basis export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised on higher expected exports of cheese and butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2021 is raised while 2022 imports are unchanged from last month.  The 2021 and 2022 skim-solids basis export forecasts are unchanged from last month. Butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts for 2021 are raised from last month on strength in demand and lower expected production.  The cheese price forecast for 2021 is reduced on current prices and continued large supplies.  The 2021 Class III price forecast is reduced from last month as the lower forecast cheese price more than offsets the higher whey price.  The Class IV price forecast is raised on higher NDM and butter prices.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is raised to $18.50 per cwt.For 2022, cheese, butter, NDM, and whey price forecasts are raised on strength in demand and lower expected milk supplies.  The 2021 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised on higher forecast dairy product prices.  The all milk price for 2022 is raised to $20.25 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. cotton estimates are largely unchanged from October.  The U.S. production forecast is slightly higher, at 18.2 million bales, while domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  U.S. ending stocks are 200,000 bales higher at 3.4 million\u201419 percent of use\u2014and 250,000 above the previous year.  The projected marketing-year average price received by upland producers is unchanged this month at 90 cents per pound, a 36 percent year-to-year increase.The global cotton balance sheet for 2021/22 includes higher production and consumption, and slightly lower ending stocks.  Beginning stocks this month are also lower, by 1 million bales, due to higher estimated consumption in earlier years for India, Pakistan, and Mexico.  Their projected use in the current year is also higher this month, and total global consumption is up 700,000 bales.  The world production forecast is 1.5 million bales higher as gains for Brazil, Australia, Pakistan, and the United States more than offset a 200,000-bale decline in Greece following unusually heavy October rainfall.  World ending stocks are projected at 86.9 million bales, 200,000 bales lower than in October, and 2.4 million bales lower than in 2020/21.",
    "June_2022": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2022/23 include lower beginning and ending stocks and higher prices.  Lower beginning stocks reflects increased exports for 2021/22.  Soybean exports for 2021/22 are raised 30 million bushels to 2.17 billion reflecting strong export sales and a reduced export forecast for Brazil.  With reduced supplies for 2022/23 and no use changes, soybean ending stocks are projected at 280 million bushels, down 30 million.  The soybean price is forecast at $14.70 per bushel, up 30 cents from last month.Global oilseed production for 2022/23 is lowered 0.3 million tons to 646.8 million as lower sunflowerseed is partly offset by higher rapeseed and soybean output.  Sunflowerseed production is lowered and soybean production is raised for Ukraine based on planting progress reports.  Rapeseed production is raised for Australia on higher harvested area.Global 2022/23 soybean ending stocks are raised 0.9 million tons to 100.5 million, driven mainly by higher beginning stocks for Argentina and Brazil.  Argentina\u2019s 2021/22 soybean production is raised 1.4 million tons to 43.4 million on better-than-expected reported yields.  Brazil\u2019s 2021/22 soybean production is raised 1.0 million tons to 126.0 million on higher area reported for Mato Grosso.SUGAR:  U.S. 2022/23 sugar supply is reduced 302,937 short tons, raw value (STRV) on lower projected production and lower beginning stocks.  With no change in use, ending stocks are reduced to 962,890 STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 7.65 percent, down from 10.05 percent last month.Beginning stocks for 2022/23 are reduced by 95,850 STRV, mostly on lower beet sugar production occurring in August-September as detailed below.  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2022/23 is projected at 31.032 million tons, a reduction of 7.8 percent from last month.  The reduction is based on late plantings that imply a national sugarbeet yield of 27.88 tons/acre, the lowest level since 2014/15 when similar delays in planting occurred.  Beet sugar production over the 2022/23 August-July crop year is projected at 4,600,931 STRV.  Unchanged from last month are forecasts of area harvested (1,113,200 acres), sucrose recovery from sliced beets (14.63 percent), sugar from desugared molasses (360,000 STRV), and sugar from imported beets (30,000 STRV).  Shrink is reduced to 6.576 percent on processors\u2019 forecasts.  Delayed planting implies a reduction in August-September sugar production of 100,000 STRV, now projected at 500,000.  This reduction implies a decrease in fiscal year (FY) 2021/22 beet sugar production by that same amount for an estimate of 5,153,518 STRV.  FY 2022/23 beet sugar production is projected at 4,809,393 STRV.Cane sugar production for 2022/23 is reduced by 27,062 STRV on lower sugarcane area harvested expected by the processor in Texas.  FTA imports are raised by 10,582 STRV on revised FAS data.  Cane sugar processors in Florida and Texas reduced their estimates of 2021/22 production by a combined total of 8,864 STRV.  A partial offset to these decreases comes from an increase in high-tier tariff imports due to additional raw sugar imports of 13,014 STRV entering in June. Mexico production for 2021/22 is increased by 40,994 metric tons (MT) to 6,207,684 on an expected strong finish to the campaign in June and extending perhaps into July.  Estimated national sugarcane yield at 68.62 MT/hectare and sucrose recovery at 11.34 percent are above recent-year averages.  The pace of area harvested has picked up toward the end of the season and is estimated to finish at 797,405 hectares.  The production forecast for 2022/23 at 6,000,000 MT is unchanged from last month.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2021/22 are increased by 3.4 percent to 4,050,000 MT on a stronger pace compared with the weak pace of last year.  The deliveries estimate is carried over to 2022/23.  There are some adjustments in ending stocks and exports are residually reduced in both years to achieve supply-use balance.  Export projections to the United States under license are unaffected by these changes.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The total U.S. red meat and poultry production forecast for 2022 is raised from last month as higher beef and pork production more than offset lower poultry production.  Beef production is raised with higher expected steer and heifer and cow slaughter more than offsetting lower expected carcass weights.  Pork production is raised for the second quarter on the current pace of slaughter, although carcass weights are reduced slightly; no changes are made to the outlying quarters.  The Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, to be released on June 29, will provide indications of supplies of hogs for slaughter in the outlying quarters as well as into early 2023.  Broiler production is reduced on the pace of slaughter and recent hatchery data.  Turkey production is reduced on the current pace of slaughter.  The production forecasts for 2023 for beef, pork, broiler meat, and turkey meat are unchanged from last month. For 2022, beef exports are raised reflecting stronger sales to several markets in Asia and the strength of demand is expected to carry into early 2023.  Stronger demand in several key markets support higher pork, broiler meat, and turkey meat exports forecasts for 2022; the 2023 forecasts are unchanged.  For 2022, the import projection for beef is lowered, while pork imports are raised reflecting recent trade data. The 2022 cattle price forecast is unchanged from last month.  Hog, broiler, and egg prices for the second quarter are lowered from last month on observed prices; no change is made to price forecasts for the outlying quarters.  Second-quarter turkey prices are raised on prices to date, but no change is made to the price forecasts for the outlying quarters.  No changes are made to the price forecasts for 2023.Milk production for 2022 is forecast lower than last month on slower growth in milk-per-cow than previously expected.  Milk per cow is also reduced slightly for 2023, resulting in lower forecast milk production.  For 2022, commercial exports on a fat basis are unchanged from last month, but skim-solids exports are raised on stronger exports of whey and lactose.  For 2023, exports are raised on a fat basis due to stronger expected cheese exports but reduced on a skim-solids basis due to weaker expected sales of skim milk powder.  Imports for 2022 are raised on stronger expected demand for cheese, butterfat products, and a number of other dairy products; strength in butterfat product imports is expected to carry into next year and the 2023 forecast is increased.  Skim-solids imports are raised for 2022 but are unchanged for 2023.Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are raised from the previous month on recent price strength and stronger anticipated demand.  The whey price forecast is lowered on observed prices.  With mostly stronger product prices, both Class III and Class IV prices are raised.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $26.20 per cwt for 2022.  Continued strengthening in demand, coupled with modest growth in production, is expected to support cheese, butter, and NDM prices in 2023.  Thus, prices for those products are raised but whey prices are expected to remain under pressure and the forecast for 2023 is lowered.  Nonetheless, the higher price for cheese more than offsets a weaker forecast whey price and the Class III price is forecast higher.  Higher forecast butter and NDM prices result in a higher Class IV price.  The 2023 all milk price is forecast higher at $23.80 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2022/23 U.S. cotton supply and demand projections are unchanged from last month, with the exception of a 5-cent increase in the season-average upland farm price to 95 cents per pound.  A sharply higher percentage of U.S. upland area has been forward contracted for 2022/23 as of May 31, and futures prices for the post-harvest months remain strong.  There are no changes to the 2021/22 U.S. balance sheet, and the projected farm price remains 92 cents.The 2022/23 world cotton balance sheet includes slightly higher production and slightly lower consumption projections compared with the previous month, and ending stocks are virtually unchanged.  Production is 200,000 bales higher due to a 100,000-bale increase for Egypt along with smaller changes for West African producers.  Global consumption is 450,000 bales lower, with the largest declines in Mexico, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Beginning stocks for 2022/23 are also lower this month as a 1.5-million-bale decline in 2021/22 global production more than offsets a 1.25-million-bale decline in projected consumption.  A 1.0-million-bale drop in India\u2019s crop accounts for most of the production change, with lower yield expectations in Brazil accounting for the remainder.  Consumption is projected 500,000 bales lower in both China and India, with smaller declines for Mexico and Vietnam.  ",
    "July_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2022/23 is projected at 132.7 million tons, down 3.9 million from last month with reductions for soybeans, canola, peanuts, and cottonseed partly offset by an increase for sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is projected at 4.5 billion bushels, down 135 million on lower harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at 87.5 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is down 2.6 million from last month.  The soybean yield forecast is unchanged at 51.5 bushels per acre.  With lower production partly offset by higher beginning stocks, 2022/23 soybean supplies are reduced 125 million bushels.  Soybean crush is reduced 10 million bushels reflecting a lower soybean meal export forecast.  Soybean exports are reduced 65 million bushels to 2.14 billion on lower U.S. supplies, increased South American supplies, and lower global imports.  With lower supplies only partly offset by reduced use, ending stocks for 2022/23 are projected at 230 million bushels, down 50 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2022/23 is forecast at $14.40 per bushel, down $0.30 from last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at $390.00 per short ton, down $10.00.  The soybean oil price forecast of 69.0 cents per pound is down 1 cent.The 2022/23 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, lower exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is reduced 3.7 million tons to 643.1 million on lower soybean, rapeseed, cottonseed, and peanut production with higher sunflowerseed production partly offsetting.  Soybean production is lowered for Canada based on the latest plantings report from Statistics Canada.  European Union rapeseed production is lowered 0.4 million tons to 17.9 million based on continued dry conditions especially in France and Germany.  Russian sunflowerseed production is increased 1.0 million tons to 15.5 million, mainly on higher area shown in government planting progress reports.The 2022/23 global soybean ending stocks are reduced slightly to 99.6 million tons as higher stocks for Argentina are more than offset by lower stocks for the United States, Brazil, and China.  Notable changes for 2021/22 include reduced soybean crush and imports for China, and increased soybean production, imports, crush, and ending stocks for Argentina.SUGAR:  Estimated U.S. ending sugar stocks for 2021/22 are increased 64,410 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 1,781,774, as an increase in supply is only partially offset by an increase in use.  USDA estimates imports to increase by 217,197 STRV.  On July 1, the Department of Commerce increased the 2021/22 Mexico export limit by 135,000 STRV.  This is counted as \u201cAdditional U.S. Needs Sugar\u201d that has a polarity of less than 99.5 degrees, meaning that it is considered as raw sugar.  All of this sugar is projected to enter in 2021/22.  Last week USDA increased the 2021/22 raw sugar TRQ by 99,999 STRV and also extended the period for this sugar to enter the United States until the end of October.  Although USTR has not yet allocated the TRQ to supplying countries, USDA projects that 38,270 STRV will enter in September for 2021/22 and 55,115 will enter in October for 2022/23 with the remainder adding to the raw sugar TRQ shortfall.  USDA increased its estimate of high-tier tariff imports by 43,927 STRV to 278,436 on additional high-duty raw sugar entering in June and on an increase in the expected pace of high-duty refined sugar entering for the remainder of the year.  Other than imports, supply is slightly decreased by a reduction in Florida cane sugar production only partially offset by a small increase in beet sugar production as reported by processors. A partial offset to the supply increase comes from a 150,000 STRV increase in deliveries for human consumption to 12,600,000.  The delivery pace for the first 8 months of the fiscal year is up 3.9 percent compared with the same period average for the 5 preceding years.  The strong pace of deliveries is expected to continue into 2022/23 for a period of time and is presently projected to add 75,000 STRV to bring the total up to 12,525,000.Projected beet sugar production in 2022/23 is increased by 124,335 STRV to 4,933,728 based on the 3.1 percent increase in NASS estimated planted area in the June 30 Acreage report over that indicated in Prospective Plantings at the end of March.  Most notably, area planted in the Upper Midwest is estimated 7.4 percent higher than in Prospective Plantings as additional area was planted to compensate for expected low yields due to delays in planting in May.  Sugarbeet harvested area is projected at 1,146,100 acres, up 3.5 percent over last year.  Yield and recovery parameters, as well as August-September production (500,000 STRV), are unchanged from last month. Imports for 2022/23 are projected at 3,501,025 STRV, an increase of 487,829 over last month.  As indicated above, some of the increase is due to additional raw sugar entering in October from the increase in the 2021/22 raw sugar TRQ.  Sugar entering under the 2022/23 TRQs is still projected at the minimum levels with the WTO and FTA bindings and with a raw sugar TRQ shortfall projected at 99,208 STRV.  To date there has been no announcement regarding additional specialty TRQ sugar.  Given these aforementioned 2022/23 projections and under the terms of the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements, sugar imported from Mexico would be expected to be projected at a level resulting in an ending U.S. stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent assuming sufficient Mexican sugar for export after meeting domestic requirements in Mexico.  Because USDA is not making any changes to Mexico supply and use projections for 2022/23 at this time, the implied maximum sugar available for export to the U.S. is projected at 1,756,180 STRV.  This is less than the 1,900,775 STRV needed to a result in ending stocks of 1,709,775 for a 13.5 percent stocks-to-use ratio.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is lowered slightly from last month as lower pork and broiler is partly offset by higher beef and turkey forecasts.  Pork production is lowered on a slower-than-expected pace of slaughter in June and lower expected second-half carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered on second quarter slaughter data but is partly offset by higher expected production in the third quarter.  Beef production is raised for the second half with lower expected carcass weights and lower third-quarter slaughter more than offset by higher fourth-quarter slaughter.  Turkey production is forecast higher based on hatchery data.  Egg production is raised from last month based on recent production data.For 2023, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised.  Pork production is raised based on 2022 second-half farrowing intentions reported in USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, and expectations that farrowings in the first half of 2023 will be modestly higher.  The beef forecast is lowered slightly on lower expected carcass weights in early 2023.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, scheduled for July 22, will provide an indication of producer intentions for heifer retention and the 2022 calf crop.  Broiler, turkey, and egg forecasts are unchanged from last month.Beef import forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are unchanged from last month while the export forecasts are raised for both years on firm international demand.  Pork import forecasts are raised for both 2022 and 2023 on the current pace of trade and firm U.S. demand.  Exports are reduced for 2022 but expected strength in foreign demand early in 2023 supports a slight increase in exports for that year.  Broiler and turkey exports for 2022 are raised on recent data; no changes are made to 2023 forecasts. Cattle price forecasts for 2022 are raised on reported second quarter prices and expected strength of packer demand in the third quarter; forecasts for 2023 prices are unchanged.  The 2022 hog price forecast is raised on second-quarter prices, but no changes are made to second-half forecasts.  For 2023, hog prices are lowered on the higher production forecast.  The broiler price forecast for 2022 is lowered on current price data; no change is made to the 2023 broiler price forecast.  Turkey price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on current prices and expectations of continued demand strength.  The 2022 and 2023 egg price forecasts are raised on current price strength.Milk production forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are lowered from last month due to slower expected growth in milk per cow.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, to be released July 22, will provide a mid-year estimate of the dairy cow inventory and producer intentions regarding retention of heifers for dairy cow replacement.Imports on a fat basis are raised for 2022 on stronger expected imports of butterfat containing products and several other dairy products, but imports on a skim solids-basis are unchanged.  No changes are made to the 2023 import forecasts of fats and skim-solids.  Exports on both a skim-solids and a fat basis are also raised for 2022, reflecting stronger expected exports of butter, cheese, whey, skim milk powder, and lactose.  The forecast for 2023 fat-basis exports is unchanged from last month but is raised on a skim solids-basis with expectations of higher skim milk powder exports carrying into 2023.The 2022 butter price forecast is raised from last month on firm demand, and the cheese price forecast is lowered on continued large stocks.  The forecasts for nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey prices are unchanged.  With a lower cheese price, the Class III price is lowered while the Class IV price is raised due to higher butter prices.  The all milk price for 2022 is lowered to $26.15 per cwt. For 2023, forecasts for cheese, butter, and NDM are raised on expected lower production, but the price forecast for whey is lowered on expected weaker international prices.  With higher cheese, butter prices, and NDM prices, the Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised.  The 2023 all milk price forecast is raised to $24.15 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2022/23 cotton projections show lower production, exports, and ending stocks compared with last month.  While the June 30 Acreage report shows nearly 250,000 additional acres planted than in the previous NASS survey, harvested area is forecast nearly 600,000 acres lower this month.  Continued below-average precipitation\u2014primarily in Texas\u2014means abandonment is projected higher this month, nearly 4 times the previous year\u2019s level.  U.S. production is projected 1 million bales lower than in June, at 15.5 million.  U.S. exports are also projected lower, down 500,000 bales to 14.0 million reflecting both lower U.S. production and a reduction in world trade.  At 2.4 million bales, 2022/23 U.S. ending stocks are now expected to be 1 million bales lower than in 2021/22.For the global 2022/23 cotton balance sheet, ending stocks are higher than projected in June, despite a 1.2 million bale cut to expected production.  Beginning stocks are higher, as 2021/22 consumption is cut nearly 2.0 million bales and projected consumption in 2022/23 is also reduced by 1.6 million.  While China accounts for half of the month-to-month decline in 2021/22 consumption, the change in 2022/23 consumption is spread over 4 major consumers:  China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Brazil is the only country besides the United States to have its 2022/23 production reduced.  World trade is cut 1.1 million bales, with reduced imports by China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Brazil\u2019s exports are 500,000 bales lower, partly reflecting lower expected production there in 2021/22.  Global ending stocks are projected 1.5 million bales higher than in June, and about equal to the 2021/22 level. ",
    "January_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2021/22 is estimated at 130.6 million tons, up 0.3 million from last month.  Larger soybean, canola, sunflowerseed, and peanut crops are partly offset with lower cottonseed production.  Soybean production is estimated at 4.44 billion bushels, up 10 million with gains for Iowa and Indiana.  Harvested area is estimated at 86.3 million acres, down slightly from the previous report.  Yield is estimated at 51.4 bushels per acre, up 0.2 bushels.  Soybean supplies are raised 11 million bushels on higher production and slightly higher beginning stocks.  With crush and export forecasts unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 350 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2021/22 is forecast at $12.60 per bushel, up 50 cents, reflecting tighter global soybean stocks and lower production forecasts for Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.  The soybean meal price is projected at $375 per short ton, up 45 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 65.0 cents per pound.The 2021/22 global soybean outlook includes lower production, crush, exports, and stocks.  Foreign soybean production is lowered 9.5 million tons on reduced crops for Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.  Brazil\u2019s soybean crop is lowered 5 million tons to 139 million, reflecting dry weather conditions in December and early January in southern Brazil.  Argentina\u2019s crop is reduced 3 million tons to 46.5 million on both a lower area and yield, resulting in lower crush and exports of meal and oil.  Paraguay\u2019s crop is lowered 1.5 million tons to 8.5 million leading to lower exports mainly to neighboring countries.  Global soybean stocks are reduced 6.8 million tons to 95.2 million on lower stocks for Brazil and Argentina.  Other notable oilseed changes include lower palm oil production for Malaysia and higher rapeseed production for India on a faster-than-expected planting pace.SUGAR:  The U.S. sugar supply for 2021/22 is increased 94,689 short tons, raw value (STRV) as increases in production and beginning stocks are only partially offset by a reduction in imports.  Louisiana cane sugar production for 2021/22 is increased by 144,333 STRV to 1,856,571 on industry reporting.  The sugarcane harvest is finishing very strong with good reported sucrose content and will continue longer than usual into the second half of January.  Beet sugar is increased by 7,650 STRV on small increases in sugar recovery and in sugarbeets for slicing.  Beginning stocks are increased by 2,915 STRV on revisions made in the 2020/21 Sweetener Market Data for increased cane sugar production.  Raw sugar imports entering under the 2020/21 TRQ that had been extended to December 31 were 55,060 STRV below what was expected last month.  Imports entering under calendar year FTA TRQs were decreased by 5,149 STRV on less sugar entering before December 31 than had been allocated.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are now projected at 1,773,038 STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.37 percent, up from 13.60 last month.  Mexico supply and use for both 2020/21 and 2021/22 are unchanged from last month.  LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2021 total red meat and poultry production estimate is raised from last month.  The beef production estimate is raised on higher non-fed cattle slaughter and heavier average carcass weights.  Pork production is reduced on the slower pace of slaughter in late 2021.  Broiler production is raised on recent slaughter data while turkey production is unchanged from the previous month.  Egg production is reduced on slightly lower table egg production.  For 2022, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month as higher expected beef and broiler production more than offsets lower pork production.  Higher expected placements in late 2021 and first-half 2022 will support greater fed cattle supplies during much of 2022.  Slightly heavier carcass weights and greater non-fed cattle slaughter in the first half of the year also supports increased beef production.  USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report on January 31, providing estimates of heifers held for breeding and an insight into the number of feeder cattle available for placement during 2022.  The pork production forecast for 2022 is reduced from the previous month as slower expected hog slaughter in the second half of the year more than offsets higher slaughter expectations in the first and second quarters.  In the December Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, producers indicated intentions to farrow fractionally fewer sows in the first half of 2022 than in 2021; hogs from this pig crop will likely be slaughtered during the second half of 2022.  First quarter broiler production is raised on hatchery data; no change is made to the outlying quarters.  No change is made to turkey and egg production forecasts.For 2021, the beef import estimate is raised on recent trade data while beef exports remain unchanged.  The pork export estimate is lowered on recent trade data.  Poultry export estimates are lowered from last month, reflecting U.S. Census Bureau revisions to second-quarter data; no change is made to export estimates for the outlying quarters.  For 2022, beef import and export forecasts are unchanged.  The pork export forecast is lowered on continued weak import demand from China and expectations of increased competition from competing exporters in a number of other markets.  Broiler export forecasts are reduced on slower expected global demand. Livestock and poultry price estimates for 2021 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  For 2022, cattle, broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised on current prices and expectations of continued firm demand.  The 2022 annual hog price forecast is unchanged with offsetting changes in first and second-quarter prices.  The 2021 milk production estimate and the forecast for 2022 are unchanged from the previous month.  On a fat basis, the 2021 import estimate and the 2022 forecast are raised from last month on recent trade data and higher imports of cheese and butterfat products while exports for 2021 and 2022 are reduced.  On a skim-solids basis, the 2021 import estimate is raised on recent trade data and higher imports of cheese and milk proteins.  The 2022 skim-solids basis import forecast is also raised.  The 2021 skim-solids basis export estimate is raised on recent trade data while the 2022 forecast is lowered on slower expected global demand for skim milk powder.  Dairy product prices for 2021 are adjusted to include December data.  The all milk price is raised on November data and a higher expected December price.  For 2022, cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey price forecasts are raised from last month on firm domestic demand and tight supplies.  Class III and Class IV prices for 2022 are raised from the previous month on higher dairy product prices.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is raised to $22.60 per cwt.COTTON:  U.S. 2021/22 cotton ending stocks are projected lower this month with lower production and a slight increase in domestic consumption more than offsetting lower exports.  Production is 660,000 bales lower at 17.6 million bales\u2014largely due to revised Texas yields\u2014and U.S. mill use is 50,000 bales higher, at 2.55 million bales, based on faster than expected gains through November.  Exports are reduced with a lower U.S. crop, continuing logistical issues in the United States and elsewhere, and a decline in projected world trade.  Exports are reduced 500,000 bales to 15.0 million, and 2021/22 ending stocks are 200,000 bales lower relative to last month, at 3.2 million bales or 18 percent of use.  The projected upland season-average price received by U.S. farmers is unchanged this month, at 90 cents per pound.Changes in the global 2021/22 balance sheet are relatively small this month, led by a 608,000-bale reduction in world production.  Projected world production is reduced as lower U.S. production and a 500,000-bale decline in India\u2019s crop more than offsets increases for China, Australia, and Pakistan.  The 2021/22 world cotton trade forecast is 385,000 bales lower this month.  A 500,000-bale decline in China\u2019s expected imports more than offsets a 200,000-bale increase for Pakistan, and smaller changes elsewhere.  Exports are projected lower for the United States and Burkina Faso, but higher for Australia and smaller Franc Zone exporters.  The 2021/22 global consumption forecast is virtually unchanged as a 500,000-bale decline in China\u2019s cotton use is offset by gains for India, Mexico, and Pakistan.  Global ending stocks for 2021/22 are down 726,000 bales this month, at 85.0 million bales, 3.4 million bales lower than in 2020/21.",
    "February_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 450 million bushels, up 10 million from last month due to a lower crush.  Soybean production, trade, and other uses remain unchanged.  Crush is reduced 10 million bushels to 1,880 million reflecting a lower soybean meal export forecast.  Meal exports are reduced on sluggish shipments and sales as well as greater expected competition from Argentina where larger projected soybean supplies boost soybean meal exports.  Lower U.S. soybean meal exports are partly offset by increased domestic soybean meal use which is raised to reflect relatively strong October-December disappearance.  Soybean oil stocks are projected lower as reduced production more than offsets larger imports and a higher extraction rate.  Soybean oil imports are raised on large shipments from Canada.The 2015/16 season-average soybean price range projection is unchanged at $8.05 to $9.55 per bushel.  Soybean meal and oil price projections are also unchanged at $270 to $310 per short ton and 28.5 to 31.5 cents per pound, respectively. Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 527.4 million tons, up slightly from last month as an increase in soybean production more than offsets lower forecasts for peanuts and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production in Argentina is projected up 1.5 million tons to 58.5 million on a higher yield projection.  The revised yield forecast is in line with an adjustment to last year\u2019s yield and is also supported by beneficial rain that has improved crop prospects.  Peanut production in India is reduced this month on lower area.  Global sunflowerseed production is projected lower as a decrease for Russia more than offsets higher production in Ukraine.Global 2015/16 soybean and product supply and use changes include increased soybean crush for Argentina and Canada, increased soybean meal and oil exports for Argentina, increased soybean oil exports for Canada, and reduced soybean meal exports for India.  In addition to the United States, higher soybean meal disappearance is projected for India where soybean meal substitutes for lower peanut meal disappearance.  Soybean meal disappearance is also raised for Canada.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 91.2 million tons, up 0.3 million.  Higher soybean stocks in Argentina, the United States, and Turkey, more than offset lower rapeseed stocks in the EU and Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar production for 2015/16 is projected at 8.849 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Production of Florida cane sugar is increased 62,539 STRV to 2.136 million based on a larger sugarcane crop reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).  Beet sugar production is reduced by 147,594 STRV to 5.010 million due to lower expected sucrose recovery from sliced sugarbeets. U.S. cane sugar refiners are expected to import more sugar in 2015/16 under the USDA re-export import program to take advantage of the large margin between domestic and world raw sugar prices.  The increase is projected at 61,524 STRV, implying total imports of 300,000.  Refiners have more than sufficient room on their license balances for this quantity of imports. Deliveries for human consumption in 2015/16 are unchanged.  Sugar deliveries are running slightly ahead of the same corresponding period last year but there are significant differences.  Strong deliveries of sugar sold by U.S. cane sugar refineries are up 2.8 percent year-over-year.  There is a stronger pace of direct consumption imports reflecting a pick-up in refined sugar imports from Mexico, and a continuing weakness in beet sugar deliveries to consumers that are down 9.5 percent year-over-year. U.S. ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1.565 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.8 percent.For the 2015/16 Mexico deliveries for human consumption are reduced 43,953 metric tons (MT) to 4.344 million, reflecting changes by the Comite Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Azucar (CONADESUCA).LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2016 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher forecast pork and broiler production more than offsets reduced forecasts for beef and turkey.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, released January 29, estimated that the cattle inventory continued to increase and pointed to a higher level of cattle outside feedlots on January 1, 2016.  However, with lower year-over placements in fourth-quarter of 2015 and only modest increases expected in first-half 2016 placements, marketings and fed cattle slaughter forecasts for 2016 are reduced.  Partly offsetting the lower fed cattle slaughter is higher expected cow slaughter and an increase in cattle carcass weights as the pace of marketings is slowed.  Pork production is raised as slaughter during January was above expectations.  Broiler production is higher as recent hatchery data shows faster-than-expected growth in chicks placed and bird weights continue to increase.  Turkey production is reduced on hatchery data.  Egg production is raised on increased hatching egg production.  Estimates of 2015 meat and egg production are adjusted to reflect December data. Beef and pork import and export forecasts for 2016 are unchanged from last month.  The broiler export forecast is lowered as South Korea reinstated its ban on imports of uncooked U.S. poultry following the discovery of HPAI in Indiana in mid-January.  Turkey exports are unchanged. The egg export forecast is unchanged, but the import forecast is raised.  Meat and egg trade estimates for 2015 are updated based on data for December.  Cattle prices for 2016 are raised from last month on higher expected prices in the first quarter.  First quarter hog prices are lowered from last month as supplies are expected to support higher slaughter levels; however, the forecast of the annual price is unchanged.  Broiler prices are lowered from last month on weaker prices to date.  The turkey price is unchanged.  Egg prices are raised in the first quarter, but lowered in the second with the annual average price lowered from last month. The milk production forecast for 2016 is raised from last month as the cow herd is adjusted slightly to reflect the January 1 dairy cow inventory reported in USDA\u2019s Cattle report and milk per cow is raised for the first quarter.  Beginning stocks are raised from last month as cheese stocks at the end of 2015 were high.  Both fat basis and skim-solids exports for 2016 are reduced from last month reflecting continued pressure on cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), whey, and lactose exports, due to large global supplies and a relatively strong dollar.  Imports are unchanged from last month.  For 2015, production, trade, and stock estimates are updated based on data through December.   Product price forecasts for NDM and whey are forecast lower as U.S. prices continue to reflect weakness in international markets.  The butter price forecast is raised as domestic demand remains strong.  The cheese price forecast is unchanged from last month, although the range is narrowed.  The Class III price is lowered on lower whey prices.  The Class IV price is down as a lower NDM price more than offsets a higher butter price.  The all milk price is forecast at $15.30 to $16.00 per cwt.COTTON:  A 5-percent reduction in exports is raising projected 2015/16 U.S. cotton ending stocks this month.  The production and domestic mill use forecasts are unchanged.  Exports are reduced 500,000 bales to 9.5 million, reflecting continued sluggish export sales, attributable mainly to sharply lower imports by China relative to last season.  Ending stocks are now projected at 3.6 million bales, or 27.5 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 58 to 61 cents per pound is raised 1 cent on the lower end, with the mid-point now forecast at 59.5 cents.  The world 2015/16 cotton forecasts include lower expectations of consumption and trade relative to last month.  Consumption and imports are reduced for China, based on continued sluggish demand, and for Pakistan, where a slower pace of imports indicates reduced demand.  World consumption is lowered 1.3 million bales, which also includes reductions for India and Brazil.  With global imports nearly 1.0 million bales below last month, exports are reduced for Brazil, India, and Pakistan, in addition to the United States.  Global stocks are now forecast at just over 104 million bales.   ",
    "May_2019": "OILSEEDS:  The 2019/20 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and slightly lower ending stocks compared to 2018/19.  The soybean crop is projected at 4,150 million bushels, down 394 million from last year\u2019s record crop on lower harvested area and trend yields.  With sharply higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 5,165 million bushels, up 3 percent from 2018/19.  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is forecast at 124.2 million tons, down 9.6 million from 2018/19, mainly on lower soybean production.  Production forecasts are also lower for canola, but higher for sunflowerseed, peanuts, and cottonseed.  The U.S. soybean crush for 2019/20 is projected at 2,115 million bushels, up from the 2018/19 forecast with higher soybean meal disappearance partly offset by lower soybean meal exports.  U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 1,950 million bushels, up 175 million from the revised forecast for 2018/19.  Despite limited growth in global soybean import demand, U.S. export share is expected to rise to 35 percent from the 2018/19 record low of 32 percent on higher supplies and competitive prices.  U.S. ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 970 million bushels, down 25 million from the revised 2018/19 forecast.  The 2019/20 U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $8.10 per bushel, down 45 cents from the 2018/19 forecast.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $290 per short ton, down $15.00 from 2018/19.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.5 cents per pound, up 1.5 cents from 2018/19.Global oilseed production for 2019/20 is projected at 598.0 million tons, down 2.9 million from 2018/19.  Global soybean production is forecast at 355.7 million tons, down 6.4 million with lower production for the United States, Argentina, and Canada partly offset by a higher Brazilian crop.  Brazil\u2019s soybean production is projected at a record 123.0 million tons, up 6.0 million on higher area and trend yield.  Argentina\u2019s soybean production is forecast at 53.0 million tons, down 3.0 million from the revised 2018/19 forecast due to a lower trend yield.  China\u2019s soybean production is projected 1.1 million tons higher to 17.0 million on reported higher planting intentions.  Global production of high-oil content seeds (rapeseed and sunflowerseed) is projected up 1 percent from 2018/19 on increased rapeseed production for Australia and Ukraine, which is partly offset by lower production for the EU and India.  Sunflowerseed crops for Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine are also lower.  Global soybean beginning stocks for 2019/20 are forecast to increase 14.1 million tons compared to 2018/19, leading to higher supply despite lower production.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 2 percent in 2019/20, compared to the prior 5-year average of 4 percent.  Protein meal consumption growth in China is flat, largely due to suppressed feed demand from outbreaks of African Swine Fever.  Global soybean exports at 151.2 million tons are also relatively flat compared to 2018/19.  China\u2019s soybean imports are projected at 87.0 million tons, up only 1.0 million from the revised 2018/19 projection and significantly lower than growth seen in prior years.  With stagnant trade and a 2 percent increase for crush offsetting the higher global supply, ending stocks at 113.1 million tons are forecast to decline slightly from 2018/19. Global vegetable oil production is projected to increase 2 percent to 208.2 million tons, led by increases for palm oil production for Indonesia, soybean oil for Argentina, and sunflowerseed oil for Russia.  Global consumption is projected to increase 3 percent in 2019/20, led by palm oil increases for Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and India.  With higher consumption, global ending stocks are projected down 1.3 million tons to 20.1 million.SUGAR:  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2019/20 is projected at 33.556 million tons with yield forecast at 30.5 tons/acre.  Slower-than-average planting progress in the Upper Midwest and Michigan has dampened prospects for significant gains in the national yield over last year and for harvesting prospects prior to October 1.  Assuming average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.943 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Beet sugar produced prior to October 1 is projected at 502,000 STRV, or about 123,000 STRV lower than the average of the 5 previous years.  Beet sugar production for 2018/19 is estimated to fall to 4.910 million STRV, as the drop in August-September production is only marginally offset by a small increase in estimated slicing recovery.  Beet sugar production for the new 2019/20 fiscal year is projected at 5.114 million STRV.  The increase over the crop year total is due to a higher level of assumed 2020 August-September production.  Cane sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 4.001 million STRV.  Small increases over 2018/19 are projected for both Florida and Texas.  Louisiana production is projected to fall from the 2018/19 record to 1.800 million STRV as a lower sugarcane yield closer to trend more than offsets expected area expansion and less sugarcane used for seed. Imports for 2019/20 are projected at 3.219 million STRV.  Projected 2019/20 TRQ imports of specialty sugar include only the WTO minimum quantity as additional quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture.  The WTO raw sugar TRQ shortfall for 2019/20 is projected at 99,000 STRV and the shortfall for 2018/19 is increased 22,046 STRV based on FAS Post reporting.  High-tier tariff imports for 2018/19 are increased to 70,000 STRV based on the pace to date.  Deliveries to domestic users for 2019/20 are projected at 12.320 million STRV, an increase of 50,000 in deliveries for human consumption over 2018/19.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are residually projected at 1.484 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.01 percent.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are estimated at 1.505 million STRV, a reduction of 119,930 matching estimated supply reductions.  The estimated 2018/19 stocks-to-use ratio is 12.23 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is increased to 6.200 million metric tons (MT) as increases to sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery more than offset an area harvested decrease.  Total deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 378,883 MT to 4.236 million.  Ending stocks available for the domestic market are projected to be the quantity of sugar needed at the end of September to meet projected delivery requirements until the start of the 2019/20 harvest in mid-November.  Exports to the United States are unchanged but exports to third-country destinations and commitments under the CEDES export certificate program now total 1.186 million MT.  Production for 2019/20 is set at 6.100 million MT; deliveries for human consumption are projected at the same level of per capita sweetener consumption as in 2018/19; and ending stocks are calculated in the same manner as in 2018/19.  Total exports are residually projected but exports to the United States are projected at the expected level of U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2020 is forecast above 2019.  Beef production is forecast higher primarily on higher projected steer and heifer slaughter and heavier carcass weights. Pork production in 2020 is forecast to increase as producers in late 2019 and into 2020 continue to expand hog supplies.  Hog carcass weights are also forecast higher in 2020 as feed prices are forecast lower.  Broiler production is expected to surpass 2019 levels as the industry responds to increased expansion of processing capacity late in 2019 and favorable feed prices. Turkey production is forecast to increase as producers respond to lower feed prices and a continued gradual recovery in prices. Egg production is forecast to increase modestly as margins improve with lower feed prices and higher egg prices during 2020. The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2019 is little changed from last month.  Small reductions are made to beef and pork, largely due to offsetting changes in slaughter and carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered on hatchery and slaughter data to date, but the turkey forecast is raised on recent hatchery data. Egg production for 2019 is raised on continued expansion of the laying flock. For 2020, tightness in competitor beef supplies and firm global demand are expected to support stronger U.S. beef exports relative to 2019. Pork exports are forecast to increase next year on stronger global demand for U.S. pork.  Both beef and pork imports are projected to decline year over year. Broiler and turkey exports are forecast higher on expected gains in foreign demand.  These forecasts assume current trade policies remain in place.The 2019 beef export forecast is reduced from last month on slower-than-anticipated exports to key trading partners.  The pork export forecast is raised as higher expected sales of pork in the second half of the year are expected to more than offset the slower-than-expected pace of exports to date.  Small changes are made to beef and pork import forecasts reflecting first-quarter trade data; however, forecasts for the remainder of the year are unchanged.  The broiler export forecast is reduced on lower-than-expected shipments in the first quarter.  The turkey export forecast is virtually unchanged from the previous month.  For 2020, fed cattle, hog, broiler, and turkey prices are forecast above 2019 on expectations of strengthening demand.  The egg prices are forecast higher as improved demand and modest growth in production are expected to support higher prices. The 2019 cattle price forecast is lowered from the previous month on recent price weakness. However, the hog price forecast is raised each quarter on stronger prices to date and expected price support from global pork demand in the second half of the year. Broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are all reduced from the previous month on weaker demand expectations for the remainder of the year. Milk production for 2020 is forecast higher than 2019.  Dairy herds are expected to begin to expand as producers respond to higher milk prices and lower feed costs.  Milk per cow is expected to continue increasing, and the forecast also reflects the one extra day due to leap year.  Commercial exports on both fat and skim-solids bases are expected to grow in 2020 as U.S. products are expected to become more competitive due to slower growth in competitor supplies. For 2020, fat basis imports are forecast higher while skim-solids basis imports are expected to decline slightly next year. Cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are forecast higher than the previous year on robust demand expectations. However, the whey price forecast is slightly lower on continued softness in export demand. The Class III price is forecast to increase as stronger cheese prices more than offset the weaker expected whey price. The Class IV price is expected to increase due to higher NDM and butter prices. The 2020 all milk price is forecast at $18.80 per cwt.The 2019 milk production forecast is reduced from the previous month on declining milk cow inventories and slow growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis exports are raised from the previous month on strong cheese sales to key trading partners. The skim-solids basis export forecast is also raised on higher expected cheese and lactose sales. The fat basis import forecast is unchanged from last month while the skim-solids basis import forecast is reduced on lower imports of milk protein products. Cheese and NDM price forecasts are raised from the previous month resulting in both Class III and Class IV prices being raised. The 2019 all milk price is forecast at $18.05 per cwt. COTTON:  Led by higher production, the U.S. cotton forecasts for 2019/20 includes higher exports and ending stocks.  Production is forecast at 22.0 million bales, based on 13.8 million planted acres as indicated in the NASS March Prospective Plantings report. While planted area is expected lower in 2019/20, increased precipitation to date in the Southwest suggests abandonment will fall from 2018/19\u2019s above-average level and harvested area will rise.  With harvested area up, production is projected 20 percent higher than in 2018/19.  Domestic mill use is projected unchanged at 3.1 million bales, while exports are expected to rise 15 percent to 17.0 million.  At 6.4 million bales, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected 1.8 million higher than the year before, equivalent to 32 percent of use.  This would be the highest U.S. stocks-to-use ratio since 2008/09.  The marketing year price received by producers is forecast to average 65 cents per pound, 5 cents lower than in 2018/19.For 2018/19, U.S. cotton production is reduced marginally from last month.  The export forecast is reduced 250,000 bales to 14.75 million bales as the expected U.S. share of world trade declines, and ending stocks are increased about 200,000 bales.The world 2019/20 cotton projections show a small decline in stocks and rebounding production and consumption.  With global harvested area for cotton projected at its highest in 7 years, and yields rebounding in major producing countries, production is expected to rise 7.0 million bales to a near-record 125.5 million. U.S. production is expected to rise the most, closely followed by India, while lower crops are foreseen for Australia and Brazil, and China\u2019s crop is projected unchanged.  World consumption is expected to rise 2.6 percent to 125.9 million bales, slightly above the previous consumption record realized in 2006/07.  Projected world trade is raised from 2018/19 as import-oriented consumers such as Bangladesh and Vietnam are accounting for a larger share of world consumption, and China\u2019s imports rise.  Global ending stocks are projected down 0.8 million this year, to 75.7 million bales, 60 percent of consumption.  An even larger decline is expected in China\u2019s stocks, and stocks outside of China are expected to rebound from their decline in 2018/19 to a new record level.For 2018/19, both world production and consumption is decreased about 500,000 bales from last month, leaving ending stocks virtually unchanged.  Production is lower in India, more than offsetting an increase in Brazil.  Use is reduced in Indonesia and Vietnam.",
    "March_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 are mostly unchanged this month.  With soybean crush and exports projected at 2.1 billion bushels and 1.8 billion bushels, respectively, ending stocks remain at 425 million bushels, down 484 million from last year\u2019s record.  Soybean and soybean oil prices are reduced this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $8.70 per bushel, down 5 cents.  The soybean oil price is projected at 31.5 cents per pound, down 2 cents.  Soybean meal prices are unchanged at $305.00 per ton.This month\u2019s 2019/20 global oilseed outlook includes higher production and stocks relative to last month.  Global soybean production is raised 2.4 million tons to 341.8 million, mainly on a 1-million-ton increase for both Argentina (to 54 million) and Brazil (to 126 million).  Argentina\u2019s larger crop is due to overall favorable conditions in higher-yielding central and northwestern farming areas.  Soybean crush is lowered 1 million tons for Argentina on the current pace to date.  With higher South American production and lower use, global soybean stocks are increased 3.6 million tons to 102.4 million.  Another notable oilseed change includes a 1-million-ton reduction for palm oil production, mainly in Malaysia and Colombia, leading to a 19 percent year-over-year decline in global vegetable oil stocks.SUGAR:  Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.200 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 471,686 from last month.  Analysis based on production through the end of February supports the following projections: area, 780,000 hectares; sugarcane yield, 63.66 MT/hectare; and sucrose recovery, 10.466 percent.  Domestic deliveries and ending stocks equaling 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar use before the start of the 2020/21 sugarcane harvest, are unchanged.  Exports outside of those shipments under license to the United States are at 33,552 MT, an amount estimated by CONADESUCA that is equal to exports through February 23.  Exports to the United States are reduced by 472,287 MT to 996,834.  Projected total U.S. supply for 2019/20 is reduced by 668,664 short tons, raw value (STRV) on lower production and imports.  Beet sugar production is forecast lower by 126,820 STRV at 4.317 million.  The reduction is based on processors\u2019 surveys of crop-year production from sugarbeet slicing in the Sweetener Market Data (SMD).  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 551,844 STRV to 1.164 million based on lower sugar supply availability in Mexico.  This reduction is partially offset by a 50,000-STRV increase in high-tier tariff imports, raising the total to 150,000.  This increase is based on import pace and on favorable margins between U.S. and world refined sugar prices.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 887,559 STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 7.24 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2020 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  Beef production is raised from the previous month as higher expected steer and heifer slaughter more than offsets lower non-fed cattle slaughter.  Heavier carcass weights are also expected to support increased beef production.  Pork production is increased on higher first-quarter slaughter.  The broiler production forecast is raised on the current pace of slaughter as well as recent hatchery data which points towards continued flock expansion.  The turkey production forecast is increased on recent production data and hatchery data.  Forecast egg production is increased as the laying flock continues to expand.  The 2020 beef import forecast is raised from last month on higher expected imports of processing grade beef, while the export forecast is reduced on weaker anticipated demand in several markets.  Pork exports are raised from last month on recent trade data and strong international demand for U.S. pork products.  The broiler and egg export forecasts are raised slightly from last month on recent trade data, while the turkey forecast is reduced. The fed cattle price forecast is reduced from last month on recent price weakness and increased production.  The hog price forecast is reduced on pressure from large hog supplies.  Broiler prices are lowered as larger supplies outweigh demand.  The first-quarter turkey price is reduced on recent price weakness.  Egg prices are raised on expected demand strength. The milk production forecast for 2020 is raised from last month on a higher expected cow inventory.  The 2020 fat basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on recent trade data and stronger anticipated imports of cheese and butterfat products.  The fat basis export forecast is reduced on slower expected demand in the first half of the year.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is raised on stronger imports of cheese, milk proteins, and several other dairy products.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is raised on expectations of continued strength in international demand.   Annual product price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are lowered from the previous month.  However, the whey price forecast is raised.  The Class III price is reduced on the lower cheese price forecast, while the Class IV price is reduced on lower butter and NDM price forecasts.  The all milk price forecast is lowered from the previous month to $18.25 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. cotton forecasts show lower production, price, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced 300,000 bales to 19.8 million, based on the March 10 Cotton Ginnings report.  The final estimates for this season\u2019s U.S. area, yield, and production will be published in the May 2020 Crop Production report.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged from last month, and ending stocks are lowered 300,000 bales to 5.1 million.  The projected marketing year average price received by upland producers of 60.0 cents per pound is down 2 cents from last month.The global cotton supply and demand estimates show larger production and ending stocks.  Consumption is forecast 850,000 bales lower, as a 1-million-bale cut in China\u2019s expected consumption is only partially offset by increases for Bangladesh and Turkey.  Production is up about 250,000 bales as larger expected crops in Brazil, Chad, and Tajikistan offset a lower U.S. crop and some smaller declines elsewhere.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected 1.3 million bales higher this month and 3.2 million bales higher than in 2018/19.",
    "March_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2020/21 are mostly unchanged this month.  With soybean crush and exports projected at 2.20 billion bushels and 2.25 billion bushels, respectively, ending stocks remain at 120 million bushels, down 405 million from last year\u2019s record.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $11.15 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Although current cash prices are significantly higher, prices received through January have averaged just over $10.00 per bushel, reflecting forward pricing at lower prices.  Soybean meal prices are also unchanged at $400.00 per ton.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 41.0 cents per pound, up 1 cent from last month.  Global 2020/21 oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and ending stocks.  Global production is raised 0.7 million tons to 595.8 million, with higher soybean and rapeseed partly offset by lower palm kernel, cottonseed, and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production for Brazil is raised 1 million tons to 134 million, reflecting a revision to the 2019/20 crop and this season\u2019s expected yield trend.  India\u2019s soybean production is raised 0.2 million tons to 10.7 million based on updated government area data.  Conversely, Argentina\u2019s soybean production is reduced 0.5 million tons to 47.5 million due to dry weather conditions over the past month.  Global oilseed exports are raised 0.8 million tons to 194.7 million, mainly on higher rapeseed exports for Ukraine and Australia.  Rapeseed imports are increased for the EU-27+UK where the crop is also raised to 17.1 million tons based on updated government data.  Global soybean crush is forecast up 1.6 million tons to 323.6 million as higher crush for Argentina and Brazil is partly offset by lower crush for China.  Higher crush in Argentina results in higher meal and oil exports.  Soybean crush for China is lowered 1 million tons to 98 million based on data to date.  Global soybean stocks are slightly higher, with increased stocks for China and Brazil that are mostly offset by lower stocks for Argentina.SUGAR:  Mexico sugar production is reduced by 50,000 metric tons (MT) to 5.900 million on lower projections of sugarcane and sugar yields based on analysis of yields reported through the end of February.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced on the pace to date but the reduction is limited by an increase made by CONADESUCA to its own projection.  The new projection is 4.030 million MT.  That projection plus expected deliveries to IMMEX put total deliveries at 4.445 million MT.  There is a minor adjustment to expected ending stocks based on reduced deliveries, and total exports are residually increased to 1.492 million MT.  Exports to the United States this month are adjusted in Mexico by the new export limit to be established by the U.S. Department of Commerce after the publication of this March 2021 WASDE as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreement.  Because the export limit set by Commerce in December 2020 is larger than U.S. Needs based on this WASDE, the export limit is projected to be set at 794,146 MT, the same as set by Commerce in December.  Added to this is a small amount exported to the United States in October 2020 from last year\u2019s allocation to bring the total to 796,528 MT or 903,703 STRV.  Exports to third countries that can include exports to the U.S. re-export import program are residually projected at 695,475 MT.SUGAR:  Mexico sugar production is reduced by 50,000 metric tons (MT) to 5.900 million on lower projections of sugarcane and sugar yields based on analysis of yields reported through the end of February.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced on the pace to date but the reduction is limited by an increase made by CONADESUCA to its own projection.  The new projection is 4.030 million MT.  That projection plus expected deliveries to IMMEX put total deliveries at 4.445 million MT.  There is a minor adjustment to expected ending stocks based on reduced deliveries, and total exports are residually increased to 1.492 million MT.  Exports to the United States this month are adjusted in Mexico by the new export limit to be established by the U.S. Department of Commerce after the publication of this March 2021 WASDE as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreement.  Because the export limit set by Commerce in December 2020 is larger than U.S. Needs based on this WASDE, the export limit is projected to be set at 794,146 MT, the same as set by Commerce in December.  Added to this is a small amount exported to the United States in October 2020 from last year\u2019s allocation to bring the total to 796,528 MT or 903,703 STRV.  Exports to third countries that can include exports to the U.S. re-export import program are residually projected at 695,475 MT.U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is decreased 219,671 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.113 million on projected increases in production being more than offset by decreases in expected imports.  Beet sugar production is increased 46,895 STRV to 5.093 million on a projected increase in national sucrose recovery to 15.275 percent.  Recoveries in all regions including the Upper Midwest are projected to be at above-average high levels, pushing the national recovery projection 1.50 standard deviations above its 8-year average since 2012/13.  Processor forecasts of beet pile shrink have not varied much during the campaign.  Estimates of an above-average proportion of sugarbeets sliced relative to beets harvested through the end of January is a sign of reduced probability of shrink for the remainder of the campaign.  Processors indicate that recent above-average temperatures are not a major concern for shrink.  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 17,666 STRV to 1.949 million on crop year estimates published in the Sweetener Market Data.  Cane sugar production in Texas is reduced 2,252 STRV to 131,748 on a processor report at the end of the campaign.  Re-export imports are decreased by 50,000 STRV on the slow pace to date and the likelihood of a continuation of lower margins between U.S. and world raw sugar prices.  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 231,980 STRV to 903,703 as detailed in the preceding paragraph.U.S. deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 75,000 STRV to 12.125 million on the slow pace through one-third of the fiscal year.  These deliveries have been difficult to project because of the unusually high Direct Consumption Imports of 204,670 STRV recorded as entering in September of 2019/20 but unlikely to have been delivered to actual end users until sometime in 2020/21.  A precise allocation is difficult to establish but this season\u2019s slow pace of recorded deliveries is indicative of the effect.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.848 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 15.07 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2021 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower expected pork, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets slightly higher beef production.  Pork production is lowered on a slower pace of hog slaughter although higher expected carcass weights in the first half of the year temper the decline.  Broiler production is lowered for the first quarter on to-date slaughter data; production in the outlying quarters is unchanged from last month.  Turkey production is lowered on recent hatchery and slaughter data.  First-half beef production is raised from last month as lower expected fed cattle slaughter in the first quarter is more than offset by higher first-half non-fed cattle slaughter.  Second-half production is adjusted to reflect a more rapid pace of first-quarter feedlot placements.  Forecast egg production is raised from last month, on both higher table and hatching egg productionThe 2021 beef import forecast is reduced on increased competition for relatively tight supplies of beef from Oceania.  The beef export forecast is unchanged from last month.  The annual forecasts for pork imports and exports are unchanged from last month.  The broiler export forecast is reduced from last month on expected weakness in demand, and the turkey forecast is lowered on the pace of exports in the first quarter.Fed cattle prices are unchanged from last month.  Hog price forecasts are raised from last month on current prices and expectations of firm demand.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised on current prices and tighter expected supplies.  Egg prices are raised on current prices and stronger expected demand into the next quarter.  The 2020 milk production estimate is adjusted to reflect recent data revisions.  For 2021, the milk production forecast is lowered slightly from last month as a higher expected cow inventory is more than offset by slower growth in milk per cow.  The 2021 fat basis import forecast is reduced on lower expected imports of butterfat; fat basis exports are raised as higher shipments of butterfat more than offset lower forecast cheese exports.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is unchanged due to offsetting changes in imports of a number of dairy products while the export forecast is lowered, reflecting expectations of lower lactose shipments which are partly offset by higher exports of skim/nonfat milk powder.  The annual cheese price forecast is unchanged from last month as weaker prices in the first part of 2021 are offset by improved demand later in the year.  Butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey price forecasts are raised from last month with expected improvements in both domestic and export demand.  These higher product prices are reflected in higher Class III and Class IV prices.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is raised to $17.75 per cwt. COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. cotton forecasts show lower production, consumption, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced 250,000 bales to 14.7 million, based on the March 9 Cotton Ginnings report.  The final estimates for this season\u2019s U.S. area, yield, and production will be published in the May 2021 Crop Production report.  Consumption is reduced 100,000 bales due to the industry\u2019s lagging recovery from the previous year\u2019s sharp losses.  Ending stocks are 100,000 bales lower this month at 4.2 million bales.  The projected marketing year average price received by upland producers of 69.0 cents per pound is up 1 cent from last month.The global 2020/21 cotton supply and demand estimates show lower production and ending stocks compared with last month, but higher mill use and trade.  Estimated global production is reduced nearly 830,000 bales, largely due to lower Brazilian and U.S. production.  Cotton import pace and indications of recovering global consumption helped boost consumption estimates for Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam, more than offsetting lower projections for the United States and Taiwan.  Imports are also projected higher in the countries with larger consumption, and the forecast for 2020/21 world trade is more than 600,000 bales higher this month.  On the export side, higher Indian exports account for most of the increase as auctions by the Cotton Corporation of India have released much of the cotton purchased last year under the Minimum Support Price program.  World ending stocks in 2020/21 are forecast 1.1 million bales lower than last month, at 94.6 million bales.  ",
    "May_2018": "OILSEEDS:  The 2018/19 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and lower ending stocks compared to 2017/18.  The soybean crop is projected at 4,280 million bushels, down 112 million from last year\u2019s record crop on lower harvested area and trend yields.  With higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 4,835 million bushels, up 2 percent from 2017/18.  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2018/19 is forecast at 127.3 million tons, down 3.7 million from 2017/18 mainly on lower soybean production.  Production forecasts are also lower for peanuts, cottonseed, and sunflowerseed, but higher for canola.  The U.S. soybean crush for 2018/19 is projected at 1,995 million bushels, up slightly from the revised 2017/18 forecast with higher soybean meal disappearance offset by lower projected soybean meal exports.  Soybean meal exports are forecast lower as Argentina\u2019s export share recovers from the effects of drought in 2017/18.  U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2,290 million bushels for 2018/19, up 225 million from 2017/18.  With forecast global soybean import growth of 5 percent, the U.S. soybean export share is projected at 39 percent, up from 2017/18 but otherwise the lowest since 2012/13.  Reduced stocks in South America this fall will limit export competition during the first half of the 2018/19 marketing year.  U.S. ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 415 million bushels, down 115 million from the revised 2017/18 forecast.  The 2018/19 U.S. season-average soybean price range is forecast at $8.75 to $11.25 per bushel compared with $9.35 per bushel in 2017/18.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $330 to $370 per short ton, compared with $360 per ton for 2017/18.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.5 to 33.5 cents per pound compared with 30.5 cents for 2017/18.The 2018/19 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, crush, exports, and lower ending stocks compared to 2017/18.  Global oilseed production is projected up 20.9 million tons to 593.7 million, with higher soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, palm kernel, and copra partly offset by lower peanuts and cottonseed.  Global soybean production is projected up 17.8 million tons to 354.5 million mostly due to recovery from drought in Argentina.  Soybean production for Argentina is projected up 17.0 million tons to 56.0 million.  Production for Brazil is flat with the revised 2017/18 crop at 117 million tons as a 4 percent increase in harvested area is offset with a return to trend yields.   The 2018/19 soybean crop for China is down 0.1 million tons to 14.1 million with a lower yield and flat harvested area as producers expand area in more profitable crops.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 4 percent in 2018/19, with China accounting for the largest share of the increase despite below-average growth in protein meal consumption.  As a result of higher protein meal demand, global crush is projected up 19.9 million tons to 509.4 million and protein meal exports are up 1.7 million tons to 90.4 million.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected at 198.6 million tons, up 7.1 million led by increases for China, India, and Indonesia.  Soybean oil production gains are forecast for China and palm oil gains for Indonesia and Malaysia.  Global vegetable oil ending stocks are projected up 2.0 million tons and nearing levels seen prior to the impact of El Ni\u00f1o on vegetable oil production in 2015/16.Global oilseed exports are up 11.2 million tons to 186.4 million in 2018/19, with soybeans accounting for most of the increase.  Soybean exports for Argentina and the United States are expected to regain global market share after declining in 2017/18.  China soybean imports are forecast to reach a record 103 million tons, up 6 million from 2017/18.  With higher soybean crush and exports, global soybean ending stocks are down 5.5 million tons to 86.7 million.  SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for the 2018/19 August/July crop year is forecast at 4.980 million short tons, raw value (STRV) based on prospective plantings from NASS, recent year trends in yields, and the pace of plantings through early May.  Adjustments for production in August/September result in fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 production at 5.221 million STRV and FY 2018/19 production at 5.036 million.  U.S. cane sugar production for 2018/19 is projected at 3.945 million STRV based on yield trends and expected area harvested.  Imports for 2018/19 are projected at 3.365 million STRV and are comprised of TRQ imports of 1.355 million; re-export imports of 350,000; imports from Mexico of 1.645 million; and high-tier tariff imports of 15,000.  Projected 2018/19 TRQ imports of specialty sugar include only the WTO minimum quantity as additional quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture.  Exports for 2018/19 are projected at 50,000 STRV and deliveries to domestic users are projected at 12.655 million.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.542 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.1 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2017/18 is estimated at 5.970 million metric tons (MT) based on lower estimated area harvested.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2017/18 are reduced by 159,035 MT based on the slow pace in the first half of the year that is to be only partially offset by an expected increase in pace during the second half.  Ending stocks are estimated at 1.243 million for domestic consumption in 2018/19 before the start of the campaign and for refined sugar that can be exported to the United States in 2018/19 at a higher return than expected in the world market.  Exports for 2017/18 to non-U.S. destinations are residually reduced by 155,388 MT.Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is projected at 6.025 million MT assuming area harvested at 780,000 hectares, cane yield of 68.8 MT per hectare, and industrial recovery of 11.23 percent.  Relatively higher per capita 2018/19 sweetener consumption, at 48.5 kilograms, reflects lower domestic sugar prices than witnessed in 2017/08.  With high fructose corn syrup consumption at the same level as in 2017/18, sugar deliveries for human consumption are projected at 4.562 million MT.  Exports include shipments to the U.S. market-projected at the expected level of U.S.  Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements-plus 10,000 MT to non-U.S. destinations.  Ending stocks are projected residually at 983,073 MT. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2019 is forecast above 2018.  Beef production is forecast above 2018 on higher slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Pork production in 2019 is forecast to increase as expected growth in farrowings and pigs per litter will support larger pig crops.  Hog weights are also forecast higher in 2019.  Broiler production is expected to surpass 2018 as the industry responds to favorable broiler prices.  Turkey production is forecast to slowly increase as prices move above year-earlier levels beginning in late 2018.  Egg production is forecast higher as the sector continues to respond to favorable prices during much of 2018. The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2018 is lowered from last month.  Cattle slaughter in the second quarter has been slower than anticipated, and the pace of marketings in the second half of the year is slowed.  However, carcass weights are increased for second half of the year, partly offsetting the reduction in the slaughter forecast.  The second-quarter pork production forecast is reduced on the current pace of slaughter, but the forecast for the second half of the year is unchanged.  Broiler production is adjusted for March slaughter data, the forecast is unchanged.  Turkey production forecasts are reduced from the previous month on slow recovery in demand and lower first-quarter-production.  Egg production for 2018 is reduced slightly on first-quarter-production data; no change is made to the outlying quarters.   For 2019, larger beef supplies and firm global demand are expected to support stronger U.S. beef exports relative to 2018.  Pork exports are forecast to increase next year as expanding supplies and competitive prices support demand for U.S. pork.  Beef and pork imports are forecast higher in 2019.  Broiler exports are forecast higher on expected continued gains in foreign demand. Changes to the 2018 red meat and poultry exports reflect March trade data, with no change to the outlying forecast.  No change is made to the forecasts for beef imports for the outlying quarters, but pork imports are raised from the previous month on the current pace of trade. Egg supply and use tables are revised to reflect changes in egg trade and stock numbers.  Information on the changes and historical supply and use data can be found at: https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/historical.htm   For 2019, fed cattle and hog prices are forecast above 2018 as relatively strong demand absorbs expected increases in supplies.  The 2019 broiler price is forecast lower than the previous year on increasing supplies and competition from expanding red meat supplies.  Turkey prices are forecast to increase with slow growth in supply and strengthening demand.  Egg prices are reduced in 2019 with slow growth in strengthening the spikes in early 2018 prices are not expected to be repeated in 2019.  However, demand is expected to remain robust, in the face of increased production.The 2018 cattle price is little changed from last month, but the hog price is reduced.  Broiler prices are raised on demand strength.  The 2018 egg price forecast is reduced on current second-quarter prices, no change is made to outlying quarters.  Turkey prices are lowered as the market continues to balance supplies with weaker-than-expected demand.Milk production for 2019 is forecast higher on gradual recovery in milk per cow.  Cow numbers are expected to remain near 2018 levels.  Commercial exports on both a fat and skim-solids basis are forecast higher than the previous year on robust global demand.  Fat and skim-solids basis imports are unchanged from 2018.  With stronger expected domestic and export demand, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey prices are forecast higher for 2019.  Butter prices are forecast slightly lower.  The Class III price is forecast higher on stronger cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is forecast higher also as a stronger expected NDM price more than offsets the lower butter price.  The 2019 all milk price is forecast at $16.25 to $17.25 per cwt, slightly higher than 2018.The 2018 milk production forecast is reduced from the previous month on lowered milk cow numbers and slow growth in milk per cow.  Exports are raised from the previous month on both a fat and skim-solids basis on strong global demand.  Imports are lowered on a fat and skim-solids basis.  Cheese, butter, NDM and whey prices are raised from the previous month resulting in both Class III and Class IV prices being raised.  The 2018 all milk price is increased to $16.20 to $16.70 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton projections for 2018/19 include smaller production, unchanged exports, and slightly higher ending stocks compared with 2017/18.  Production is forecast at 19.5 million bales, based on 13.5 million planted acres as indicated in the March Prospective Plantings report.  While planted area is expected higher in 2018/19, reduced precipitation to date in the Southwest suggests abandonment will likely rise from 2017/18\u2019s below-average level.  With higher abandonment and the U.S. yield falling from the previous year\u2019s record-high, production is projected 7 percent lower than in 2017/18.  Domestic mill use in 2018/19 is projected slightly higher at 3.4 million bales, while exports are expected to remain unchanged at 15.5 million.  At 5.2 million bales, 2018/19 ending stocks are projected 500,000 bales higher than the year before, and equivalent to 28 percent of total use.  The range for the marketing year average price received by producers is 55.0 to 75.0 cents per pound.For 2017/18, U.S. cotton production is reduced marginally from last month.  The export forecast is increased 500,000 bales to 15.5 million bales as the expected U.S. share of world trade rises, with ending stocks lowered accordingly.The world 2018/19 cotton projections show a decline in stocks of 4.5 million bales, as consumption once again exceeds production.  Global production is expected to fall marginally, as area declines 1 percent. Expected production in India\u2014the world\u2019s largest producer\u2014is unchanged from 2017/18.  Lower production in the United States, Australia, and China is nearly offset by higher expected crops in Pakistan, Turkey, and Brazil.  Global consumption is projected to rise 3.9 percent to a new record high, as a growing world economy drives mill use higher around the world.  Projected world trade is raised from 2017/18, as import-oriented consumers such as Vietnam and Bangladesh are accounting for a larger share of world consumption, and China\u2019s imports rise.  Ending stocks are projected down 4.5 million bales year to year, at 83.8 million bales, 67 percent of world consumption.  An even larger decline is expected in China\u2019s stocks, and stocks outside of China are expected to rise for the third consecutive year.For 2017/18, both world production and consumption is increased about 300,000 bales from last month, leaving ending stocks virtually unchanged.  Production is higher in Uzbekistan and Australia and consumption is higher in Turkey and Uzbekistan.  Australia\u2019s expected exports are 300,000 bales lower, while higher exports are now expected for the United States, Chad, Benin, and Uzbekistan.",
    "February_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2016/17 are unchanged this month, leaving ending stocks at 420 million bushels.  Soybean exports are projected at 2,050 million bushels, up 114 million from last year.  Although soybean export commitments through January are significantly higher than a year ago, competition from expected record South American exports will limit U.S. shipments to well below last year\u2019s record levels this summer.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2016/17 is projected at $9.10 to $9.90 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint from last month.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 34 to 37 cents per pound, and soybean meal prices are projected at $310 to $340 per short ton, both unchanged at the midpoint from last month.The 2016/17 global oilseeds supply and demand estimates include lower production and ending stocks compared to last month.  Oilseed production is projected down 0.6 million tons to 554.2 million, with lower soybean production only partly offset by higher sunflowerseed, rapeseed, and cottonseed.  Global soybean production is down 1.2 million tons to 336.6 million mainly on a 1.5-million-ton reduction for Argentina where heavy rain impacted the expected harvested area.  Partially offsetting is a 0.3-million-ton increase for Ukraine on higher yields.  Global soybean crush is raised 0.4 million tons to 290.7 million, largely driven by the most recent crush data for Argentina.  Global sunflowerseed production is raised 0.5 million tons to 44.8 million on increases for Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the EU.Global oilseed trade is projected up 0.7 million tons to 161.0 million tons.  Increased exports of soybeans from Ukraine, rapeseed from Canada, and sunflowerseed from Argentina account for most of the change.  Global oilseed stocks are projected lower, mostly reflecting reduced soybean stocks for Argentina and reduced rapeseed stocks for Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. cane sugar production for 2016/17 is reduced by 72,803 short tons, raw value (STRV).  Almost all the reduction is based on industry reporting in Florida indicating less sugarcane acreage and slightly lower yields than previously forecast. U.S. exports for 2016/17 are now projected at 75,000 STRV on indications of planned beet sugar exports of 50,000 this fiscal year.  This increase is matched by an equivalent increase in raw sugar re-export imports.  No change is made this month in deliveries for human consumption.  Although, beet sugar deliveries have been strong through the fiscal year\u2019s first quarter, bulk cane sugar deliveries are far below trend with significant year-over-year declines in deliveries to bakery/cereal, confectionery, and multiple and other food use manufacturers.  Additionally, although projected imports from Mexico are unchanged from last month, there remains market uncertainty regarding availability of sugar imported from Mexico as a result of ongoing talks concerning the AD and CVD Suspension Agreements.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.808 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.8 percent, down from last month\u2019s 15.4 percent.  There are no changes to the Mexico 2016/17 sugar supply and use this month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Estimated red meat and poultry production for 2016 was adjusted to reflect December slaughter data.  Total red meat and poultry production for 2017 is lowered, largely reflecting decreased pork and poultry forecasts.  Beef production is raised.  Placements and marketings for the year are raised, resulting in higher cattle slaughter.  The January Cattle inventory report estimated that total cattle and calf numbers on January 1, 2017 increased for the third consecutive year.  Beef cow numbers were above 2016, and producers indicated they were holding more heifers for addition to the breeding herd.  The report also indicated a year-over-year increase in the number of cattle outside feedlots.  The January Cattle on Feed report showed higher than expected placement numbers in December, implying that larger numbers of fed cattle will be marketed during the spring quarter.  Cattle weights are reduced for 2017 as producers are expected to remain current in feedlot marketings.  Pork production in the first quarter is reduced on the current pace of slaughter and slightly lighter carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered as increases in production in the first quarter are more than offset by reductions in the second half of the year.  Table egg production is increased on hatchery data and expectations of relatively favorable returns, but this is more than offset by a lowered hatching egg production forecast.  No changes were made to turkey production.  Livestock trade estimates for 2016 are adjusted to reflect December data.  For 2017, forecast beef imports are raised on expectations of higher shipments of processing beef from Oceania.  Robust demand for U.S. beef supports higher forecast beef exports for the year.  No changes are made to pork, poultry and egg trade forecasts. Cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts are raised to reflect demand strength.  Turkey prices are forecast lower on current prices.  Egg prices are increased on current price strength.  The milk production forecast for 2017 is raised from last month.  Improved returns in 2017 are expected to result in a slightly higher forecast cow inventory during the late part of 2017.  Milk output per cow is also raised as improved returns are expected to support continued improvements in the quality of dairy rations.  Beginning stocks on both a fat and skim-solids basis are raised from last month on December 31 storage data; stocks at the end of 2017 are raised, reflecting increased beginning inventories and higher dairy product production in 2017.  Fat-basis imports are reduced as domestic butterfat is expected to be more competitive with the EU; skim-solids imports are unchanged.  Fat basis exports are unchanged and skim-solids basis exports are raised slightly.  Skim-solids imports are virtually unchanged as weaker exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM) are offset with stronger whey sales.  For 2016, milk production, output per cow, trade, and stock estimates are updated based on data through December.  \u00a0Cheese and butter price forecasts are lowered as product production is expected to reflect higher forecast milk production and beginning stocks are relatively high.  The nonfat dry milk price forecast is unchanged, but the whey price is raised from last month on the strength of domestic and international demand.  The Class III price is raised as the higher whey price more than offsets the lower cheese price forecast.  The Class IV price is reduced as the butter price forecast is lowered.  The all milk price is forecast higher at $17.70 to $18.40 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2016/17 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show slightly higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  The export forecast is raised 200,000 bales to 12.7 million based on strong export sales during January.  Ending stocks are now estimated at 4.8 million bales, equivalent to 30 percent of total disappearance.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to average between 67 and 71 cents per pound, an increase of 2 cents on both ends of the range, as recent market prices have exceeded previous expectations.The 2016/17 world cotton forecasts include slightly higher consumption and lower ending stocks.  World production is virtually unchanged from last month, as a higher estimate for China is mostly offset by lower expectations for Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.  Global consumption is forecast higher, due mainly to increases for India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  World ending stocks are now projected at 89.9 million bales.",
    "April_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2021/22 include increased exports and seed use, and lower ending stocks.  Soybean exports are raised 25 million bushels to 2.12 billion, partly offsetting lower exports from Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia.  Seed use is raised in line with record soybean plantings indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 260 million bushels, down 25 million from last month.  Soybean oil changes include increased exports and lower ending stocks.  Despite relatively high soybean oil prices, export sales have been stronger than expected through March.  A lower soybean meal export forecast is offset by slightly higher domestic disappearance.The season-average soybean price forecast is unchanged this month at $13.25 per bushel.  Soybean meal prices are also unchanged at $420 per short ton.  The soybean oil price is projected at 70.0 cents per pound, up 2 cents.  The 2021/22 global soybean supply and demand forecasts include lower production, crush, trade, and ending stocks.  Global soybean production is reduced 3.1 million tons to 350.7 million on lower crops for Brazil and Paraguay.  Soybean crush is lowered for Paraguay on lower supplies and reduced for China on the current pace to date.  China\u2019s soybean imports are also lowered 3 million tons to 91 million.  Lower soybean exports for Brazil, Paraguay, Russia, and Ukraine are partly offset by higher U.S. shipments.  Global soybean stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons to 89.6 million mainly on lower U.S. and Argentine stocks.Another notable oilseed change this month includes lower sunflower seed crush for Ukraine, leading to lower meal and oil supplies for major markets like India, China, the EU, and Turkey.  Partly offsetting these declines are higher palm and rapeseed oil imports for China, higher soybean oil imports for India, higher soybean meal imports for Turkey, and higher soybean imports for the EU.  SUGAR:  USDA projects that decreases in 2021/22 U.S. sugar supply combined with an increase in use lowers ending stocks to 1,566,978 short tons, raw value (STRV) for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.53 percent. U.S. sugar supply for 2021/22 is decreased 60,343 STRV as decreases in sugar production are only mildly offset by an increase in high-tier tariff imports.  Beet sugar production is decreased by 50,670 STRV to 5,338,098.  About half of the reduction is attributable to lower production expected out of Michigan due to increased beet pile shrink reported by processors this month and fewer sugarbeets imported from Canada for processing than originally expected.  With production in the Red River Valley region expected to run unusually long into the first week of June, production is reduced marginally to reflect increased risk to sugarbeets stored in increasingly warmer conditions.  Also, production in California is expected to be slightly lower than originally forecast.  Beet campaigns in the Pacific Northwest and Great Plains are planned to be over by the date of this WASDE and their production estimates made in late March have been incorporated into projected beet sugar production.  Florida sugar production is decreased 22,335 STRV to 1,937,235 based on lower sucrose recovery from processors\u2019 continuing analyses of the effect of late January freezes on the crop.  Texas sugar production is reduced by 2,000 STRV to 128,000 based on processor reporting.  High-tier tariff imports are increased by 14,662 STRV on recorded entries of raw sugar in the first two months of 2022.  Projected high-tier tariff imports of refined sugar are unchanged from last month.U.S. sugar supply for 2021/22 is decreased 60,343 STRV as decreases in sugar production are only mildly offset by an increase in high-tier tariff imports.  Beet sugar production is decreased by 50,670 STRV to 5,338,098.  About half of the reduction is attributable to lower production expected out of Michigan due to increased beet pile shrink reported by processors this month and fewer sugarbeets imported from Canada for processing than originally expected.  With production in the Red River Valley region expected to run unusually long into the first week of June, production is reduced marginally to reflect increased risk to sugarbeets stored in increasingly warmer conditions.  Also, production in California is expected to be slightly lower than originally forecast.  Beet campaigns in the Pacific Northwest and Great Plains are planned to be over by the date of this WASDE and their production estimates made in late March have been incorporated into projected beet sugar production.  Florida sugar production is decreased 22,335 STRV to 1,937,235 based on lower sucrose recovery from processors\u2019 continuing analyses of the effect of late January freezes on the crop.  Texas sugar production is reduced by 2,000 STRV to 128,000 based on processor reporting.  High-tier tariff imports are increased by 14,662 STRV on recorded entries of raw sugar in the first two months of 2022.  Projected high-tier tariff imports of refined sugar are unchanged from last month.U.S. sugar deliveries for human consumption are increased by 65,000 STRV to 12,365,000 based on strong to-date deliveries by beet processors and on higher-than-expected direct consumption imports though the end of February.Sugar production for 2021/22 in Mexico is increased by 187,690 metric tons (MT) to 6,166,690.  Analysis of production data through week 26 (March 26) of the campaign implies that sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery will likely be higher than forecast but area harvest is likely to be about 10,000 hectares lower.  The new forecast for yield is 69.038 MT per hectare; recovery is 11.29 percent; and area harvested is 791,383 hectares.  This projection is close to the third estimate recently released by CONADESUCA in Mexico.  They estimate production at 6,174,813 MT.  They project a higher area harvested than USDA, a lower yield, and about the same level of recovery.  Sugar exports are projected to increase by the same amount as the production increase.  Exports under license to the United States are unchanged from last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2022 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month, as reduced forecasts for pork and poultry offset a higher forecast for beef.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month as higher expected first quarter placements support larger fed cattle slaughter and more non-fed cattle slaughter is expected.  Pork production is lowered based on the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on March 30, which estimated the March 1 inventory and indicated producers\u2019 intentions to reduce farrowings in March-May.  Broiler production is reduced on lower expected slaughter in the first quarter.  No changes are made to production in the outlying quarters.  Turkey meat production is lowered as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) discoveries to date are resulting in tighter supplies of turkeys.  Egg production is also lowered as HPAI detections to date have affected the laying flock.For 2022, beef imports are forecast higher from last month based on recent trade data.  Pork imports are raised while exports are reduced on tight supplies and strong domestic prices.  The broiler export forecast is raised as import demand has been strong in the early part of the year.  The turkey export forecast is reduced as HPAI discoveries are resulting in restrictions from areas affected by outbreaks.Fed-cattle prices are unchanged from last month.  Hog prices are raised on tighter supplies and continued strength in demand.  Broiler prices are raised on current prices and continued strength in demand.  Turkey and egg price forecasts are raised on current prices and expected tighter supplies.The milk production forecast for 2022 is raised on higher dairy cow numbers.  The fat basis import forecast is lowered on lower expected imports of cheese and butterfat products, while exports are raised on stronger cheese and butter shipments.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is raised as imports of milk proteins are projected to more than offset weaker projected cheese imports.  Exports are raised on higher projected shipments for whey and skim milk powder.Price forecasts for cheese and butter were raised from the previous month on tighter stocks and firm demand.  Non-fat dry milk prices were raised fractionally while whey prices were lowered, as U.S. prices are expected to become competitive with international prices.  With the higher cheese price more than offsetting a lower whey price, the Class III price is raised.  The Class IV price is raised on higher butter and nonfat dry milk.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is increased to $25.80 per cwt. COTTON:  The U.S. cotton 2021/22 supply and demand forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The marketing year price received by upland cotton producers is projected at a record 91 cents per pound, up 1 cent, reflecting recent high prices.  The February 2022 upland farm price reached a record 100 cents per pound.Month-to-month changes in the global 2021/22 cotton estimates are also small, with higher production and lower consumption resulting in an 800,000-bale increase in ending stocks, to 83.4 million.  Production is forecast 340,000 bales higher, with increases for Pakistan and Greece.  A 500,000-bale decline in China\u2019s expected consumption resulted in a similar decline in the global estimate, which now stands at 124.1 million.  A 300,000-bale decline in both China\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s import forecasts are only partly offset by a 150,000-bale increase for Turkey.  World trade is projected about 450,000 bales lower this month, with exports projected lower for India, Brazil, and Malaysia.",
    "October_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2022/23 is forecasted at 126.9 million tons, down 1.6 million from last month with lower soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production partly offset with higher forecasts for canola and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.3 billion bushels, down 65 million on lower yields.  Harvested area is unchanged at 86.6 million acres.  The soybean yield is projected at 49.8 bushels per acre, down 0.7 bushels from the September forecast.  With lower production partly offset by higher beginning stocks, supplies are reduced 31 million bushels.  Soybean exports are reduced 40 million bushels to 2.05 billion with increased competition from South America.  With lower exports partly offset by increased crush, ending stocks are unchanged from last month at 200 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2022/23 is forecast at $14.00 per bushel, down 35 cents.  Soybean meal and oil prices are unchanged at $390.00 per short ton and 69 cents per pound respectively.The foreign 2022/23 oilseed outlook includes higher production, crush, trade, and ending stocks.  Foreign production is increased 3.3 million tons to 519.7 million mainly on higher soybean and rapeseed production.  Soybean production for Brazil is increased 3.0 million tons to 152.0 million, reflecting higher area reported by Brazil\u2019s National Supply Company (CONAB).  Rapeseed production for the EU is increased 1.0 million tons to 19.2 million on higher production for France, Germany, and Poland.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton reduction to 19.5 million for Canada\u2019s canola crop on a lower yield.Global 2022/23 soybean exports are raised 1.0 million tons to 168.8 million with higher exports for Argentina and Brazil that are partly offset by lower exports for the United States and Paraguay.  China\u2019s soybean imports are raised 1.0 million tons to 98.0 million with higher global supplies.  Conversely, China\u2019s canola imports are lowered 0.5 million tons to 2.3 million reflecting lower Canadian supplies.  Global soybean ending stocks are raised 1.6 million tons to 100.5 million, mainly on higher stocks for Brazil.SUGAR:  U.S. 2022/23 sugar ending stocks are increased by 161,933 short tons, raw value (STRV) on increases in imports, beginning stocks, and production.  On September 15, the USDA established the fiscal year (FY) 2022/23 refined sugar TRQ at 220,000 metric tons, raw value (MTRV), and on September 19 USTR allocated the in-quota quantity of the TRQ among supplying countries.  USDA\u2019s action results in an increase in 2022/23 TRQ imports of 217,206 STRV.  Added to this amount are imports amounting to 77,437 STRV from the 2021/22 raw sugar TRQ that did not enter in September as forecast but are forecast to enter in 2022/23 after USDA extended the period for entry until December 31, 2022.  Arrayed against these increases is an increase in the raw sugar TRQ shortfall by 155,424 STRV to 254,632, due mostly to the decision of officials in the Philippines to allocate all production to domestic consumption and reduce exports to zero.  Also, sugar imported under calendar year FTA TRQs are reduced by 10,201 STRV mostly because that sugar entered earlier in 2021/22 than originally forecast. The net effect of beginning stocks on the 2022/23 supply and use balance results from stronger-than-expected Louisiana cane sugar production in September and from increases in 2021/22 high-tier tariff imports and imports from Mexico.  Based on NASS sugar crop yield changes in the October Crop Production report, 2022/23 cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased and more than offsets a small reduction in beet sugar production.  Texas cane sugar is reduced on processor reporting.  The 2022/23 ending stocks-to-use ratio is projected at 14.8 percent, up from 13.5 last month.Mexico sugar production for 2022/23 is reduced 100,000 MT to 5.900 million.  Area harvested is expected to remain above 800,000 hectares for a second consecutive year as good domestic returns in 2021/22 have incentivized growers to maintain area planted to sugarcane.  Nonetheless, yields are expected to be lower than last year due to lower rainfall in certain growing areas, higher prices for fertilizers and other inputs, and some field labor shortages.  Lower production is matched by lower exports on a one-to-one basis.  Total exports forecast at 1.403 million MT only slightly exceed exports of 1.385 million projected for shipment under export license to the United States.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month, as higher beef, pork, and broiler forecasts are partly offset by lower turkey.  Beef is raised for the second half with higher expected slaughter as well as higher carcass weights for the period.  Pork for the third quarter is raised on a higher-than-expected slaughter; no change is made to the fourth-quarter forecast.  Broiler production is raised on current slaughter data and higher eggs set and chicks placed.  Turkey is lowered, with an increase in the third quarter more than offset by a reduction in the fourth quarter due in part to recent Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) discoveries.  Egg production is lowered from last month on recent hatchery data and recent HPAI discoveries.For 2023, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised on higher beef and broiler production.  Beef is raised on higher expected placements in late 2022 which will be marketed in the first half of 2023.  Broiler production is raised on expected growth in eggs set and chicks placed during the year.  Pork is lowered on expected farrowings and modest growth in pigs per litter.  Turkey is lowered slightly for the first two quarters.  Egg production is raised, with a raised second half forecast more than offsetting a reduction in first half production.Beef imports for 2022 are lowered on slower third quarter exports.  Exports are raised on the current pace of trade in the third quarter but the forecast for the fourth quarter is unchanged.  Beef imports for 2023 are raised. 2023 exports are forecast higher on expectations of firm demand in a number of Asian markets.  Pork imports and exports are lowered for 2022 on recent data.  For 2023, pork exports are lowered on tighter domestic supplies and weaker demand in several markets.  Broiler export forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are unchanged.  Turkey exports are lowered for 2022 but raised for 2023.  Cattle price forecasts for 2022 are raised on current strength in packer demand, but forecasts for 2023 are unchanged.  The 2022 hog price forecast is lowered on recent prices, and 2023 prices are also lowered on weaker expected demand and competition from increased broiler supplies.  Broiler price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are lowered on higher forecast production.  Turkey price forecasts for both 2022 and 2023 are raised with lowered production forecasts.  Egg price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on recent prices and expectations of continued firm demand. The milk production forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised from last month.  The cow inventory is raised reflecting a more rapid pace of expansion in late 2022 and the first half of 2023.  Output-per-cow is raised for the remainder of 2022 and into the first part of 2023.Fat and skim-solids basis imports for 2022 are raised, largely driven by recent trade data and higher expected imports of cheese and a number of other products; the skim imports increase also reflects strong milk protein concentrate and casein imports.  Forecasts for 2023 imports for both bases are also raised largely on stronger imports of butter.  Exports for both years are raised on expectations of stronger whey, lactose, and butterfat product exports.  However, export growth in skim milk powder is expected to be slower in 2022.For 2022, forecasts for butter and cheese prices are raised on current price strength, but nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey prices are lowered.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are raised, reflecting the higher butter and cheese prices respectively.  For 2023, price forecasts for butter and cheese are raised while the NDM prices is lower.  The Class III price is raised on higher cheese and Class IV price forecast is raised as the higher butter price more than offsets the lower expected NDM price.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is raised to $25.60 per cwt and the 2023 all milk price is raised to $22.90 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2022/23 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show slightly lower exports and higher ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is virtually unchanged at 13.8 million bales, less than 1 percent lower than a month earlier.  With world trade projected lower, the export forecast is 100,000 bales lower at 12.5 million bales, while ending stocks are 100,000 bales higher.  The 2022/23 season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 90.0 cents per pound, 6 cents lower than last month and slightly below the final 2021/22 record-high price of 91.4 cents.In the 2022/23 world balance sheet this month, consumption is 3.0 million bales lower and ending stocks are 3.1 million bales higher.  China\u2019s historical consumption estimates are revised back to 2019/20, with the largest change in 2021/22, which is revised down 2.0 million bales.  China\u2019s projected 2022/23 consumption is 1.0 million bales lower this month, as is India\u2019s. Pakistan\u2019s is 500,000 bales lower, and consumption is also lower for Turkey, Mexico, and Vietnam.  World trade is projected nearly 1 million bales lower than it was in September, with declines in imports by China, Pakistan, Mexico, Turkey, and Vietnam.  Exports are lower for Australia, Brazil, India, Benin, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Greece, and Mexico, as well as the United States.  World production in 2022/23 is projected nearly 400,000 bales lower than it was a month ago, largely reflecting lower crops in Pakistan and Benin.",
    "October_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2020/21 is projected at 126.6 million tons, down 1.1 million from last month with lower soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production partly offset with higher canola and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.3 billion bushels, down 45 million on lower harvested area.  Harvested area is reduced 0.7 million acres to 82.3 million, with reductions for Kansas, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  The soybean yield is projected at 51.9 bushels per acre, unchanged from the September forecast.  Soybean supplies for 2020/21 are forecast at 4.8 billion bushels, down 96 million on lower production and beginning stocks.  Despite reduced supplies, soybean exports are raised 75 million bushels on record early-season sales.  With smaller supplies and increased exports, ending stocks are projected at 290 million bushels, down 170 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $9.80 per bushel, up 55 cents reflecting smaller supplies and higher exports.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $335.00 per short ton, up $20.00.  The soybean oil price forecast is raised 0.5 cents to 32.5 cents per pound.The 2020/21 foreign oilseed production is lowered 2.6 million tons to 478.9 million mainly on lower sunflowerseed production for Ukraine, the EU, Moldova, and Argentina.  Ukraine\u2019s sunflowerseed output is lowered 2 million tons to 15 million on drought conditions during the season and harvest results to date.  Dryness also impacted yield prospects for Romania, Bulgaria, and Moldova.  Lower sunflowerseed production for Ukraine results in lower global sunflower meal and oil exports.  Partly offsetting are higher exports of palm oil from Malaysia and rapeseed meal from Russia.  The 2020/21 foreign soybean supply and demand forecasts include lower beginning stocks, higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are lowered mainly on higher 2019/20 crush for China that is partly offset by lower exports and higher stocks for Brazil.  The 2020/21 soybean imports, crush, and meal consumption are higher for China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam, aligning with prior year increases in domestic meal use.  Argentina\u2019s exports are lowered 0.5 million tons due to stronger competition from the United States.  With lower supplies in the United States and higher foreign use, global ending stocks are reduced 4.9 million tons to 88.7 million.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2019/20 is increased by 50,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.293 million due to an increase in projected August-September production from the 2020/21 crop year sugarbeet harvest.  Beet sugar production for 2020/21 is increased by 41,095 STRV to 5.206 million on a 1.9 percent increase made by NASS for sugarbeet area less the projected 50,000-STRV produced in August and September.  Similarly, cane sugar production in Louisiana for 2019/20 is increased by 90,243 STRV on stronger-than-expected production occurring in September.  However, the consequent decrease in fiscal year 2020/21 production to 1.785 million STRV is only 65,246 because it is expected that the recent trend toward increased September production in Louisiana will continue.  The projection for September 2021 is 54,754 STRV, the average of the previous five years. Many exporters with raw sugar TRQ access have taken advantage of the extension of the quota-year to the end of October by deferring shipments expected in September into October.  The 22,047 STRV shortfall linked to the September TRQ increase is eliminated because allocations made by USTR after last month\u2019s WASDE to Brazil and Australia are expected to be filled.  Estimated re-export imports for 2019/20 are increased to 432,405 STRV and high-tier imports for 2019/20 are increased to 250,631 STRV.  Both of these changes are made on the basis of Customs reporting.Many exporters with raw sugar TRQ access have taken advantage of the extension of the quota-year to the end of October by deferring shipments expected in September into October.  The 22,047 STRV shortfall linked to the September TRQ increase is eliminated because allocations made by USTR after last month\u2019s WASDE to Brazil and Australia are expected to be filled.  Estimated re-export imports for 2019/20 are increased to 432,405 STRV and high-tier imports for 2019/20 are increased to 250,631 STRV.  Both of these changes are made on the basis of Customs reporting.Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are increased by 50,000 STRV to 12,220 million on the pace to date.  Deliveries for 2020/21 correspondingly are increased by 50,000 STRV to 12,220 million.  Exports for 2019/20 are increased by 10,000 STRV to 45,000 on the pace to date.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are estimated at 1.702 million for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.8 percent.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 1.749 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.2 percent.Mexico sugar supply and use for 2019/20 has small changes including an increase in imports of sugar for consumption, a small decrease for exports to non-U.S. destinations, and reduced deliveries with a decrease in those for consumption only partially offset by an increase for the IMMEX program.  These changes are made on the basis of the pace to date.  The net result is to increase ending stocks by 39,505 metric tons (MT).  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) deliveries for 2019/20 are reduced by 30,000 MT, dry weight, to 1.380 million on the current pace.  For 2020/21, deliveries to IMMEX are increased by 20,000 MT.  There is a small increase in ending stocks based on delivery projections for the initial 2.5-month period in 2021/22 before the production campaign begins.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are residually increased by 15,338 MT.  Projected deliveries of HFCS for 2020/21 are unchanged at 1.470 million MT, dry weight.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2020 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  Beef production is raised from the previous month on higher expected second-half cattle slaughter.  The pork production forecast is reduced on lower second-half commercial hog slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  The broiler and turkey production forecasts are raised on production data to date.  The egg production forecast is raised slightly from last month.  For 2021, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month on higher expected beef, pork, and broiler production.  Beef production is raised from last month on higher expected steer and heifer slaughter.  Pork production is raised on higher forecast commercial hog slaughter.  The 2021 broiler production forecast is also raised from last month on slightly more rapid production growth, but the turkey production forecast is unchanged. Egg supply and use tables are revised to reflect changes in egg stock numbers.  Information on the changes and historical supply and use data can be found at: https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity-markets/wasde/historical-revisionsThe 2020 beef import forecast is raised on recent trade data and continued firm import demand for processing grade beef, while exports are unchanged.  For 2021, the beef import forecast is raised, while the beef export forecast is lowered on slower expected global demand.  The 2020 and 2021 pork export forecasts are lowered from last month on weakness in global import demand.  The 2020 and 2021 broiler export forecasts are raised from last month.  Egg exports for 2020 are raised slightly, but no change is made to the 2021 export forecast. The cattle price forecasts for 2020 is raised on current price strength and robust beef demand; this increase in price strength was carried into early 2021.  Hog price forecasts are raised for 2020 and 2021 on current price movements and continued strength in demand.  The 2020 broiler price forecast is virtually unchanged from last month but is reduced for 2021 on expected supply pressure.  The turkey price forecasts for 2020 and 2021 are raised.  The 2020 egg price forecast is increased on current strength in prices, but 2021 price forecast is unchanged. The milk production forecast for 2020 is raised from the previous month on slightly higher cow numbers and a more rapid pace of growth in milk per cow.  For 2020, the fat basis import forecast is unchanged while the export forecast is reduced on lower exports of butterfat products.  The skim-solids import forecast remains unchanged, but the export forecast is reduced on lower dry whey and lactose shipments.  Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts are raised from last month, while the whey forecast is unchanged.  The 2020 forecast for butter is reduced.  The Class III price forecast is raised on the higher cheese price forecast.  The Class IV price forecast is also raised as the higher NDM price more than offsets the lower butter price forecast.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $18.00 per cwt. For 2021, a larger dairy herd and higher milk per cow are expected to support higher milk production from last month.  The fat basis import forecast is unchanged, while the fat basis export forecast is lowered on weak global import demand for butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged, while the export forecast is raised on expected robust international demand for skim milk powder and whey products.  Dairy product price forecasts for cheese, butter, NDM, and whey are raised from last month.  Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised on higher product prices.  The all milk price forecast is raised to $17.60 per cwt for 2021.  COTTON:  The 2020/21 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show marginally lower production compared with last month.  Production is lowered less than 1 percent, to 17.0 million bales.  Domestic mill use, exports, and ending stocks are unchanged.  At 7.2 million bales, U.S. ending stocks in 2020/21 are projected at 42 percent of use, compared with 41 percent in 2019/20.  The 2020/21 season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 61.0 cents per pound, 2 cents higher than last month and slightly above the final 2019/20 price of 59.6 cents.The 2020/21 world cotton supply and demand forecasts feature lower production, higher consumption and trade, and lower ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is lowered more than 900,000 bales with declines in Mali, Pakistan, and Greece offsetting a larger expected crop in Nigeria.  Consumption is 1.5 million bales higher, largely reflecting revisions for China and India.  World trade is projected about 500,000 bales higher this month, reflecting a 500,000-bale increase in China\u2019s projected imports, and on the export side, higher exports by Brazil and Uzbekistan offsetting a decline for Mali.  World ending stocks in 2020/21 are now projected 2.7 million bales lower than in September, at 101.1 million bales, equivalent to 89 percent of consumption.",
    "January_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2020/21 is estimated at 122.4 million tons, down 1.25 million from the previous report.  Smaller soybean, peanut, and cottonseed crops are partly offset by an increase for canola and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is estimated at 4.135 billion bushels, down 35 million led by reductions for Minnesota, Iowa, and Kansas.  Harvested area is estimated at 82.3 million acres, up slightly from the previous report.  Yield is estimated at 50.2 bushels per acre, down 0.5 bushels.  With higher imports and slightly higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are down 14 million bushels from last month.  The soybean crush forecast is raised 5 million bushels to 2.2 billion, reflecting improved prospects for soybean meal exports with a lower export forecast for Argentina.  The soybean export forecast is raised 30 million to a record 2.23 billion bushels.  With lower supplies and increased use, ending stocks are projected at 140 million bushels, down 35 million from the previous forecast.Soybean and soybean product prices are forecast higher this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is projected at $11.15 per bushel, up 60 cents as cash prices in Central Illinois reach 6-year highs.  The soybean meal price is projected at $390 per short ton, up 20 dollars.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 38.5 cents per pound, up 2.5 cents.Foreign 2020/21 oilseed production is relatively unchanged, with higher sunflowerseed mostly offset by lower soybean, cottonseed, peanut, rapeseed, and palm kernel output.  Sunflowerseed production is increased 0.5 million tons to 13.5 million for Russia based on recent government estimates.  Soybean production is lowered 2 million tons to 48 million for Argentina and 0.2 million to 2.2 million for Uruguay, reflecting dry weather conditions in December and early January.  Mostly offsetting lower South American soybean production is a 2.1-million-ton increase to 19.6 million for China on recent government data.  Global soybean stocks are lowered 1.3 million tons to 84.3 million, with lower stocks for Argentina and the United States that are partly offset by higher stocks for China.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is increased 111,093 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.117 million on projected increases in production more than compensating for decreases in imports.  Beet sugar production is increased 133,632 STRV on an increase in projected national sucrose recovery to 14.955 percent.  The increase is based on increases in sucrose recoveries in all major producing regions over last month with data now available for August through November.  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased 62,000 STRV to 1.886 million on reporting made close to the end of the production campaign.  Imports for 2020/21 are reduced by 84,539 STRV.  Most of the decrease is due to corrections in Customs 2019/20 TRQ reporting for the 13-month quota year that lowered entries in October by 77,869 STRV but increased entries in September 2019/20 by 81,631.  FTA TRQ entries for 2020/21 are decreased by 9,453 STRV and by 626 STRV for 2019/20.  Imports from Mexico for 2020/21 are increased by 2,783 STRV on sugar allocated for 2019/20 entering in October according to a CONADESUCA report.  There are no changes in use for 2020/21.  The increase in imports for 2019/20 that arrived late in the fiscal year had the effect of increasing measured deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 by 81,005 STRV to 12.316 million.  There are no changes made for corresponding deliveries in 2020/21 due to overall uncertainties in underlying demand by end users.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 increase to 1.777 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.40 percent.  There are no changes in Mexico sugar supply and use balances for 2019/20 or for 2020/21.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2020 total red meat and poultry production estimate is reduced from last month.  The beef production estimate is reduced on lower cattle slaughter.  The pork production estimate is reduced as the slower pace of slaughter in late 2020 more than offset heavier carcass weights.  The broiler production estimate is reduced on recent hatchery and slaughter data, while the turkey production estimate is lowered or recent production data.  The egg production estimate is unchanged.  For 2021, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from the previous month as lower expected beef, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets higher pork production.  Lower expected placements in late 2020 will impact fed cattle supplies in mid-2021.  Cattle carcass weights are forecast lighter for 2021.  USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report on January 29, providing estimates of heifers held for breeding and an insight into the number of feeder cattle available for placement during 2021.  The pork production forecast for 2021 is raised from the previous month as higher expected hog slaughter more than offsets lighter expected carcass weights.  Broiler, turkey, and egg production forecasts are lowered for 2021 as higher feed costs are expected to slow production growth.  The beef import estimate for 2020 is reduced on recent trade data while the 2021 import forecast is reduced primarily due to lower expected imports from Australia.  Beef exports for 2020 and 2021 are raised from last month.  Pork exports for 2020 and 2021 are lowered from last month on weaker import demand from key trading partners.  The 2020 broiler export estimate is raised on recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2021 export forecast.Livestock and poultry price estimates for 2020 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  For 2021, cattle prices are raised on a lower production forecast.  The 2021 hog price forecast is raised, reflecting strong domestic demand.  Broiler prices are raised as lower forecast production in the second half of the year is expected to support firmer prices.  Turkey and egg price forecasts for 2021 are raised on lower expected production.  The milk production estimate for 2020 and forecast for 2021 are raised from December on growth in milk per cow and higher dairy cow numbers.  Fat basis imports for 2020 and 2021 are reduced from last month on lower expected imports of butterfat products.  The fat basis export estimate for 2020 is unchanged, but the 2021 forecast is raised on higher expected exports of butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis import estimate for 2020 in unchanged but the 2021 forecast is reduced.  The skim-solids basis export estimate for 2020 is reduced on recent trade data while the 2021 forecast is unchanged. Dairy product price estimates for 2020 reflect December price data.  For 2021, cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are raised from last month on firm domestic demand.  The 2021 Class III price and Class IV price are raised from the previous month on higher product prices.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is raised to $17.65 per cwt. COTTON:  The U.S. 2020/21 cotton outlook shows higher exports, and lower production and ending stocks this month.  Production is lowered nearly 1 million bales to 15.0 million, led by a 500,000-bale decline in Texas.  U.S. mill use is reduced 100,000 bales, but exports are raised 250,000 bales as rebounding world demand helps sustain a strong export pace.  With lower production and higher demand, 2020/21 U.S. ending stocks are 1.1 million bales lower relative to last month, at 4.6 million bales or 26 percent of use.  The upland season-average price received by U.S. farmers is projected 3 cents higher this month, at 68 cents per pound.The largest changes in the global 2020/21 cotton outlook this month are lower production and ending stocks, led by changes in the United States.  World production is forecast more than 1.0 million bales lower, with non-U.S. reductions including Pakistan, Mali, and Argentina.  Outside the United States, Pakistan\u2019s 200,000-bale decline is the largest change, with smaller upward revisions for Greece, Australia, and Turkey.  Projected world consumption in 2020/21 is 100,000 bales higher this month, as a 500,000-bale increase for China and a 200,000-bale increase for Turkey are partly offset by reductions for Indonesia, Vietnam, the United States, and some smaller countries.  Similarly, a 500,000-bale increase in China\u2019s projected imports is partly offset by a 200,000-bale decline for Indonesia.  World trade is projected 350,000 bales higher, with Australia and Mexico exports up by smaller amounts than the United States, and lower exports projected for Mali.  World ending stocks in 2020/21 are 1.2 million bales lower this month, at 96.3 million bales, 3.0 million bales lower than the year before. ",
    "April_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2019/20 include lower exports, seed use, and residual use, higher crush, and higher ending stocks.  Soybean exports are reduced mainly on strong competition from Brazil.  Lower seed use reflects plantings for the 2020/21 crop indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report.  Residual use is reduced based on indications in the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  Soybean crush is raised on higher soybean meal exports and increased domestic disappearance.  Domestic soybean meal use is forecast higher with an expected reduction in available supplies of DDGs resulting from lower ethanol production.  With higher crush only partly offsetting lower exports, seed, and residual use, ending stocks are projected at 480 million bushels, up 55 million.  The season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.65 per bushel, down 5 cents.  The soybean oil price is projected at 30.0 cents per pound, down 1.5 cents reflecting increased production and ending stocks.  Soybean meal prices are unchanged at $305 per short ton.The 2019/20 global oilseed outlook includes lower production, exports, and stocks compared to last month.  Global soybean production is reduced 3.7 million tons to 338.1 million on lower production for Argentina and Brazil.  Argentina\u2019s production is lowered 2 million tons to 52 million, reflecting dry conditions in the main growing regions during the latter part of February into early March.  Soybean production for Brazil is lowered 1.5 million tons to 124.5 million due to dry conditions in Rio Grande do Sul while the crop was in pod-filling and maturation stages.  Global soybean exports are lowered 0.4 million tons to 151.5 million.  U.S. and Canadian exports are lowered while Brazil\u2019s shipments are revised up due to a competitive exchange rate and ample exportable supplies.  China\u2019s imports are raised 1 million tons to 89 million, reflecting higher Brazilian shipments.  Global soybean ending stocks are 2.0 million tons lower than last month as lower stocks in Brazil are partly offset with higher U.S. and Chinese stocks.SUGAR:  Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.235 million metric tons (MT), an increase of 35,000 over last month.  Analysis based on production through the first week of April supports increases in area over last month but lower sugarcane yield and about the same sucrose recovery as last month.  Domestic deliveries and ending stocks, equal to 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar use before the start of the 2020/21 sugarcane harvest, are unchanged.  Exports outside of those shipments under license to the United States are increased to 39,187 MT on the pace to date.  Exports to the United States are increased by 29,365 MT to 1.026 million.  Projected total U.S. supply for 2019/20 is increased by 546,884 short tons, raw value (STRV) on increased production and imports.  All production changes are made on the basis of forecasts and/or data supplied by processors.  Cane sugar production is increased by 26,460 STRV on more production expected in Florida partially offset by a reduction in Texas.  Beet sugar production is reduced by 19,797 STRV on lower expected sugar from slicing and from the de-sugaring of molasses.  TRQ imports are increased to reflect the USDA action announced on April 1 of increases to both the raw sugar and refined sugar TRQs.  The raw sugar shortfall is increased to 84,092 STRV to reflect sugar not expected to enter the United States although allocated.  Imports from Mexico are increased by 34,312 STRV.  High-tier tariff imports are unchanged.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.434 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 11.70 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total red meat and poultry production for 2020 is reduced from last month as sectors at all levels adjust to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty.  The beef production forecast is reduced as lower expected steer and heifer slaughter more than offsets higher cow slaughter.  However, beef production declines are partially offset by heavier carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is reduced from the previous month; however, the recent Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report points to relatively large supplies of hogs available for slaughter during most of the year and heavier hog carcass weights will also support increased production.  The broiler production forecast is lowered as producers respond to weaker demand and lower broiler prices.  The turkey production forecast is reduced slightly on recent production data.  Egg production for 2020 is reduced from the previous month on slower expected growth in the laying flock.Beef, pork, and poultry export forecasts are reduced from last month on slowing global demand. Price forecasts for 2020 are lowered for cattle, hogs, and broilers on generally weak demand and large supplies.  The turkey price forecast is raised from last month on current prices.  Egg prices are raised on strong demand.  The milk production forecast is reduced from last month on slower growth in milk per cow.  The average dairy cow inventory is little changed as a higher-than-expected early year inventory is expected to decline later in the year.  The 2020 fat basis export forecast is reduced primarily on lower expected exports of butterfat products and cheese due to weaker global demand.  The fat basis import forecast is also reduced on lower imports of butter.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecast is reduced, reflecting slowing international demand for nonfat dry milk (NDM) and lactose.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged from last month.  Product prices are forecast lower on weak demand, large supplies, and larger stocks.  Thus, both the Class III and Class IV prices are forecast lower.  The all milk price is forecast lower than the previous month at $14.35 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2019/20 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show sharply lower exports, lower consumption, and higher ending stocks compared with last month.  A developing global economic slowdown with little precedent is expected to significantly reduce global cotton demand and trade, resulting in one of the largest one-month reductions in projected U.S. cotton exports ever:  down 1.5 million bales to 15.0 million.  Consumption is 100,000 bales lower, and ending stocks are 1.6 million bales higher.  Ending stocks are now expected to reach 6.7 million bales, equivalent to 37 percent of total disappearance, compared with March\u2019s expected 26 percent.  The projected marketing year average price received by upland producers of 59.0 cents per pound is down 1 cent from last month.Lower world consumption this month results in lower projected trade and higher projected 2019/20 ending stocks.  Consumption is lower for every major country, with total world consumption down 7.6 million bales or 6.4 percent from March.  At 110.6 million bales, world consumption in 2019/20 is now projected to be 8.1 percent lower than in 2018/19.  This would be one of the largest annual declines on record.  World trade in 2019/20 is down 3.0 million bales from the March estimate.  With relatively small increases in beginning stocks and production this month, 2019/20 expected ending stocks are 7.9 million bales higher than estimated in March, and 11.0 million bales higher than the year before.",
    "February_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supplies are increased 10 million bushels to 4,086 million on higher projected imports.  Soybean exports for 2014/15 are projected at 1,790 million bushels, up 20 million reflecting the record pace of shipments through January.  Soybean crush is raised 15 million bushels to 1,795 million on increased domestic soybean meal disappearance, which is raised in line with projected gains in meat production.  Soybean oil production gains from additional crush are mostly offset with a lower extraction rate.  With increased production and reduced exports, soybean oil ending stocks are projected at 1.505 billion pounds, up 75 million.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 385 million bushels, down 25 million from last month.The 2014/15 season-average soybean price range projection is unchanged at $9.45 to $10.95 per bushel.  The soybean meal price is projected at $350 to $390 per short ton, up 10 dollars on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price range is projected at 30 to 34 cents per pound, down 1 cent on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 532.1 million tons, down slightly from last month.  Global soybean production is raised 0.7 million tons to a record 315.1 million. Prospects for the Argentina soybean crop have improved with ample moisture and mild temperatures.  As a result, the crop is projected at a record 56.0 million tons, up 1.0 million.  Soybean production is also raised for China, Russia, and Ukraine.  Soybean production for Brazil is projected at 94.5 million tons, down 1.0 million on lower yields reflecting the impact of limited rainfall in eastern growing areas.  Sunflowerseed changes this month include reduced production for Russia and India with a partly offsetting increase for Ukraine.  India rapeseed production is projected at 6.9 million tons, down 650 thousand tons on lower area.  Other changes include reduced peanut production for India, increased peanut production for Argentina, and increased cottonseed production for Pakistan.  Palm oil production is reduced for Malaysia as a result of recent flooding.Global soybean and product supply and use changes this month include increased crush and product exports for Argentina, Bolivia, and Russia; increased soybean imports for Russia and the United States; and reduced soybean meal exports for India.  Global oilseed stocks are projected lower, mostly reflecting reduced soybean stocks for Brazil and the United States and reduced rapeseed stocks for Canada and India.SUGAR:  There are no changes in the 2014/15 U.S. sugar supply and use from last month. Imports from Mexico are still projected at 1.602 million short tons raw value (STRV), based on the Target Quantity of U.S. Needs defined in the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico, dated December 19, 2014.  Ending stocks are calculated residually at 1.666 million STRV.  The implied stocks-to-use ratio is 13.6 percent.  There are no changes in the 2014/15 Mexico sugar supply and use from last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2015 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is higher than last month on increases to beef, pork, and poultry production.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report, released January 30, revised the 2014 calf crop higher and pointed to a higher level of cattle outside feedlots on January 1, 2015.  Given greater supplies of cattle outside feedlots, placements are expected to decline less rapidly during 2015 with fed cattle slaughter higher than forecast last month.  Cow slaughter is raised slightly from last month with larger cow numbers, but is still expected to be below 2014.  The increase in slaughter is partly offset by slower growth in carcass weights.  Pork production is raised as slaughter to date has been above expectations.  Broiler production is higher as recent hatchery data shows faster-than-expected growth in chicks placed.  Turkey production is also raised on hatchery data.  Egg production is unchanged.  Estimates of 2014 meat and egg production are adjusted to reflect December data. The 2015 beef import forecast is raised from last month as demand for processing grade beef remains strong and strength of the dollar makes the United States an attractive market.  Beef exports for 2015 are reduced due to relatively high U.S. prices.  Pork exports are lowered based on increased competition from other exporters and slower growth in global demand.  The broiler export forecast is lowered on weaker demand.  Turkey exports are also reduced.  The egg export forecast is raised.  Meat and egg trade estimates for 2014 are updated based on data for December.  Larger meat supplies are expected to pressure prices for livestock and poultry.  Cattle prices for 2015 are lowered from last month, reflecting recent price weakness for fed cattle and greater supplies of competing meats.  The hog price forecast is down on greater supplies of market hogs and weaker-than-expected demand.  Broiler and turkey prices are reduced on larger production.  Egg prices are unchanged. The milk production forecast for 2015 is lowered from last month as slower growth in output per cow more than offsets faster herd expansion.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report estimated dairy replacement heifers expected to calve during 2015 were up about 1 percent from a year ago, while the number of milk cows on January 1, 2015, was 1 percent above 2014 and the highest since 2009.  Fat-basis exports for 2015 are unchanged from last month.  Skim-solids exports are higher mostly on greater shipments of whey.  Fat basis imports are higher on expectations of greater cheese imports during 2015.  For 2014, production, output per cow, trade, price and stock estimates are adjusted based on published data through December.  \u00a0Product price forecasts for butter and whey are higher, supported by strong demand and price strength to date.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is lower as strong competition in export markets is expected to persist during the first half of 2015.  The cheese price is unchanged, but the range is narrowed.  The Class III price is raised on higher whey prices.  The Class IV price is down as a lower NDM price more than offsets a higher butter price.  The all milk price is lowered to $17.40 to $18.10 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2014/15 U.S. cotton estimates show lower domestic mill use and higher exports compared with last month.  Estimates of production and total supply are unchanged.  A reduction of 150,000 bales in domestic mill use to 3.65 million bales reflects slower-than-expected consumption through December.  U.S. exports are raised 700,000 bales to 10.7 million based on remarkably heavy sales of about 2.0 million bales for the past 4 weeks, due to strong foreign mill demand for medium- and high-grade cotton.  This level of exports would account for 31 percent of world trade, the highest U.S. share in four seasons.  Forecast ending stocks of 4.2 million bales are reduced 0.5 million from last month.  The expected marketing year average price received by producers of 61 cents is lowered 0.5 cents per pound at the midpoint and on both ends of the range.A combination of slightly higher production and sharply lower consumption is raising projected world ending stocks by 1.2 million bales this month.  Production is raised primarily in Pakistan, reflecting the latest ginning arrival data.  Consumption is reduced mainly in China and the United States, but is raised for Vietnam and Indonesia.  The available data continue to indicate a sluggish world consumption response to lower cotton prices, mainly because prices of manmade fibers have also fallen.  World trade is raised slightly, owing to a 300,000-bale increase in forecast imports by China.  Exports are raised for the United States and Pakistan, partially offset by a decrease for India.  World ending stocks are now projected to reach nearly 110 million bales.  ",
    "August_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is projected at 111.5 million tons, down 4.5 million from last month mainly due to a lower soybean production forecast.  Soybean production is forecast at 3.68 billion bushels, down 165 million on lower harvested area.  Harvested area is forecast at 75.9 million acres, down 3.4 million from the NASS June Acreage Report led by reductions for Ohio and South Dakota.  These States account for almost half of the national reduction.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 48.5 bushels per acre is unchanged from last month but 3.1 bushels below last year\u2019s level.  With lower production partly offset by higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies for 2019/20 are projected at 4.77 billion bushels, down 3 percent from last month.  U.S. soybean exports are reduced 100 million bushels to 1.78 billion reflecting reduced global import demand, mainly for China.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 755 million bushels, down 40 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $8.40 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal and oil price forecasts are also unchanged at $300 per short ton and 29.5 cents per pound, respectively.Changes for 2018/19 include reduced soybean crush, reflecting lower domestic use and exports of soybean meal.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 1.07 billion bushels, up 20 million.This month\u2019s 2019/20 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, trade, and stocks compared to last month.  Lower soybean, rapeseed, and peanut production are partly offset by higher sunflowerseed output.  Rapeseed production is lowered for the EU mainly on a lower area and yield for France.  India\u2019s soybean and peanut harvested area is reduced due to slow planting progress to date.  Ukraine\u2019s sunflowerseed production is forecast higher, as timely rainfall in late July and early August boosted yield prospects.Global 2019/20 oilseed exports are reduced 3.0 million tons mainly on a 2-million-ton reduction to soybean trade.  China\u2019s soybean imports are lowered 2 million tons to 85 million reflecting lower soybean meal crush in 2019/20.  With crush also lowered in 2018/19, China\u2019s protein meal consumption growth is forecasted flat in 2019/20.  Global 2019/20 soybean ending stocks are lower relative to last month due to lower stocks in the United States and China.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for the August-July 2019/20 crop year is projected at 5.106 million short tons, raw value (STRV) on sugarbeet area and yield forecasts made by NASS in Crop Production and recent year averages for sucrose extraction and pile shrink.  Most of the increase over last month is projected to occur in the early August-September harvest year period, resulting in an increase of 88,653 STRV to 5.008 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year.  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is increased to 5.179 million STRV.  Florida cane sugar production for 2019/20 is increased by 44,603 STRV based on a strong NASS forecast of sugarcane yields that pushes the projected sugarcane crop up 2.4 percent over the prior year.Imports for 2019/20 are increased by 24,302 STRV primarily on the USDA decision to extend the period of entry of the 2018/19 raw sugar TRQ to October 15.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2018/19 are increased by 75,000 STRV to 12.200 million based on strength in direct consumption imports.  Through June, however, deliveries by domestic processors have remained relatively flat for the past two years.  Human consumption deliveries for 2019/20 are increased in line but only by 50,000 STRV in a changing sugar and sweeteners\u2019 deliveries environment as evidenced by flat to declining total and per-capita caloric sweeteners and refined sugar for calendar years 2016-18.  (See Tables 49 and 50 at the ERS Sugar and Sweeteners Yearbook.)  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 1.699 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.74 percent.  There are no significant changes from last month to sugar supply and use in Mexico for 2018/19 or for 2019/20. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2019 is raised from last month as increases in broiler and turkey production more than offset declines in beef and pork production.  Broiler production is raised on June production data and the expectation of a continued higher proportion of heavier weight birds in the slaughter mix.  Forecast turkey production is also raised on recent production data and higher expected slaughter in the fourth quarter.  The decline in beef production largely reflects a slower pace of cattle slaughter in the third quarter and lighter expected carcass weights through 2019.  The pork production forecast is reduced on a slower expected pace of slaughter during the third quarter. For 2020, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised on higher expected beef and poultry production forecasts.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month on a higher expected pace of first-half marketings.  However, the 2019 calf-crop estimated in the July 19th Cattle report implies lower-than-previously expected marketings in the latter part of 2020.  Continued growth in average bird weights is expected to result in higher forecast broiler production in 2020.  Turkey production is raised slightly.  Forecast pork production is unchanged from the previous month. For 2019, the beef import forecast is adjusted to reflect June trade data; the import forecast for 2020 is unchanged.  Beef export forecasts are unchanged for both 2019 and 2020.  The pork import forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are lowered on slowing import demand. The pork export forecast for 2019 is adjusted based on June trade data. No change is made to the 2020 pork export forecast.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is reduced on recent trade data, but the 2020 forecast is unchanged.  No changes are made to 2019 and 2020 turkey trade forecasts.  Fed cattle prices are raised for 2019 on current price strength.  The 2020 price forecast is also raised.  The 2019 hog price forecast is lowered on recent price pressure, but the 2020 price forecast is unchanged from last month.  The broiler price forecast for 2019 and 2020 are lowered on larger forecast supplies.  The turkey price forecast for 2019 is raised; no change is made to the 2020 turkey price forecast.  The milk production forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are reduced from last month on expectations of a smaller dairy herd and slower growth in milk per cow.  For 2019, the fat basis import forecast is raised from last month on strong demand for imported butter, while the fat basis export forecast is reduced slightly.  The skim-solid basis import forecast for 2019 is raised on higher imports of milk protein concentrates and other dairy products.  The 2019 skim-solids basis export forecast is reduced primarily on weaker-than-expected sales of nonfat dry milk (NDM).  For 2020, the fat basis import forecast is raised on continued strong import demand for butter, while the fat basis export forecast is reduced on slowing sales of butterfat.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2020 is raised, but the export forecast is lowered on expected continued weak demand for NDM and increased global competition.  For 2019, cheese, butter, and whey price forecasts are raised.  The NDM price forecast is reduced on current price weakness and slowing demand.  For 2020, price forecasts for cheese, butter, and NDM are lowered from the previous month, but the whey price forecast is unchanged.  The 2019 Class III price forecast is raised on higher forecast cheese and whey prices.  The 2019 Class IV price forecasts is reduced from the previous month as the lower forecast NDM price more than offsets the higher butter price.  For 2020, the Class III and Class IV product price forecasts are lower on weaker dairy product prices.  The 2019 all milk price is forecast higher at $18.30 per cwt, but the all milk price forecast for 2020 is forecast lower than the previous month at $18.80 per cwt.  COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. cotton outlook includes higher beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks.  Production for the 2019 crop is raised 2 percent to 22.5 million bales, on NASS\u2019s first survey-based production forecast.  The survey indicates slightly higher area and yield compared with last month\u2019s expectations, resulting in the largest crop in 14 years.  Beginning stocks are raised 250,000 bales due to lower-than-expected 2018/19 exports.  Exports for 2019/20 are raised 200,000 bales this month, and ending stocks are raised 500,000 bales to 7.2 million.  The 2019/20 season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 60 cents per pound, down 3 cents from last month.Lower projected world cotton consumption largely accounts for a 2.0-million-bale increase in 2019/20 global ending stocks from the July forecast.  Beginning stocks are higher, largely due to a 500,000-bale decline in 2018/19 consumption.  Production in 2019/20 is forecast 200,000 bales lower this month, but higher beginning stocks and a 1.2-million-bale decline in projected consumption are more than offsetting.  Consumption is lower in China, India, and Uzbekistan.",
    "March_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2021/22 include higher exports and lower ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s report.  Soybean exports are raised 40 million bushels to 2.09 billion with lower production and reduced exports for South America.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 285 million bushels, down 40 million from last month.  With rising soybean oil prices, soybean oil used for biofuel is reduced this month.  Soybean oil exports are raised in response to reduced global sunflowerseed oil trade and tighter global vegetable oil supplies.Soybean and product prices are all raised this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2021/22 is forecast at $13.25 per bushel, up 25 cents.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $420 per short ton, up 10 dollars.  The soybean oil price is raised 2 cents to 68.0 cents per pound.Global 2021/22 soybean supply and demand forecasts include lower production, crush, exports, and stocks.  Global soybean production is reduced 10.1 million tons to 353.8 million.  Brazil\u2019s crop is lowered 7.0 million tons to 127 million, Argentina is lowered 1.5 million tons to 43.5 million, Paraguay is lowered 1.0 million tons to 5.3 million, and Uruguay is lowered 0.6 million to 2.0 million.  While global soybean crush is lowered 5.0 million tons on a slower-than-expected crush pace for China and lower South American supplies, sunflowerseed crush is reduced another 2.2 million mainly for Ukraine.  Major markets impacted by lower Ukrainian sunflowerseed crush and product exports include India and the EU.  Lower sunflower product supplies in these markets are partly offset by higher soybean oil imports for India and rapeseed imports for the EU.  Tighter oilseed supplies and high oilseed meal and vegetable oil prices reduce forecasts for global demand growth.  Global 2021/22 soybean trade is reduced 6.4 million tons to 158.6 million, with lower exports for South America that are partly offset by higher U.S. exports.  Imports for China are reduced 3 million tons to 94 million.  Other markets with lower imports include Russia, Bangladesh, Egypt, the EU, Pakistan, Argentina, and Belarus.  Global soybean stocks are lowered 2.9 million tons to 90.0 million, the lowest level since 2015/16.  SUGAR:  USDA projects an increase in 2021/22 U.S. sugar use combined with a reduction in supply to decrease ending stocks to 1,692,320 short tons, raw value (STRV) for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.6 percent.  U.S. sugar deliveries for human consumption are increased by 100,000 STRV to 12,300,000 based on strong to-date deliveries by beet processors and on higher-than-expected direct consumption imports though the end of January.  U.S. sugar supply for 2021/22 is decreased 26,152 STRV as decreases in sugar production are only partially offset by increases in imports.  Florida sugar production is decreased 45,059 STRV to 1,959,570 based on lower sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery from processors\u2019 analyses of the effect of late January freezes on the crop.  Beet sugar production is decreased 12,183 STRV to 3,995,680 on processors\u2019 forecast of lower sucrose extraction and an increase in beet pile shrink.  Imports are increased by 31,091 STRV to 3,043,041.  Raw sugar TRQ imports are increased by 20,591 STRV based on updated FAS analysis of expected TRQ shortfall.  High-tier tariff sugar imports are increased by 25,000 STRV to 175,000.  High-tier tariff imports are estimated at 126,272 STRV through the end of February. Raw sugar imports constitute about 62 percent of the total.  Since the December 2021 sugar WASDE, the USDA has been projecting monthly high-tier tariff refined sugar imports at about 7,250 STRV.  Extending this projection across the remaining seven months of the fiscal year yields the 175,000 STRV projection.  Imports from Mexico are projected at 1,050,212 STRV, a reduction of 14,500. SUGAR:  USDA projects an increase in 2021/22 U.S. sugar use combined with a reduction in supply to decrease ending stocks to 1,692,320 short tons, raw value (STRV) for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.6 percent.

Extending this projection across the remaining seven months of the fiscal year yields the 175,000 STRV projection.  Imports from Mexico are projected at 1,050,212 STRV, a reduction of 14,500. The net change for the Mexico 2021/22 sugar supply and use balance is a small 4,000 metric ton (MT) reduction in imports accompanied by a reduction of the same amount in exports.  Exports to the United States for 2021/22 are projected at 898,808 MT, a decrease of 12,410 from last month.  Calculated U.S. Needs implied by the March 2022 U.S. Sugar WASDE as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements is 887,843 MT (1,037,400 STRV).  There is an additional export amount of 10,965 MT (12,812 STRV) from the 2020/21 export allocation to Mexico that was permitted by the U.S. Department of Commerce to enter the United States after September 30.  Exports other than to the United States under export license increase by 8,410 MT to 852,025.The net change for the Mexico 2021/22 sugar supply and use balance is a small 4,000 metric ton (MT) reduction in imports accompanied by a reduction of the same amount in exports.

Exports other than to the United States under export license increase by 8,410 MT to 852,025.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2022 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered slightly from last month, as higher forecast beef and turkey production is more than offset by lower projections for pork and broilers.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month on higher fed and non-fed cattle slaughter.  Pork production is lowered on a slower pace of slaughter and slightly lighter carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered on lower slaughter to date and a slower-than-previously-expected recovery in hatchability.  Turkey production forecasts are raised on early-year hatchery data.  The egg production forecast is reduced on slower expected growth in first-half production.  Supply and use estimates for 2021 are adjusted for revisions in production and stock data.Beef import and export forecasts are raised from last month based on recent trade data.  Pork imports are raised on strong domestic prices, while exports are reduced on increased competition in a number of Asian markets.  The broiler export forecast is reduced as higher prices reduce export opportunities.  The turkey export forecast is reduced from last month primarily as recent discoveries of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza have resulted in import restrictions by Mexico.  Fed-cattle prices are raised on firm packer demand and declining inventories of fed cattle.  Hog prices are raised on observed prices to date and expected strength in demand.  Broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised on current prices and relatively slow production growth.  The milk production forecast for 2022 is lowered from last month, on lower dairy cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow.  The fat basis import forecast is lowered on lower expected imports of cheese and butterfat products, while exports are reduced on lower shipments of whole milk powder and whey.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is raised, primarily as higher imports of milk proteins more than offset weaker cheese imports.  The export forecast is reduced on weaker expected sales of whey products and skim milk powders.  Changes in 2021 estimates of supply and use reflect revised production and stock data.Price forecasts for cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey are raised from the previous month on current prices, lower expected production, and continued demand strength.  With higher product prices, both Class III and the Class IV prices are raised.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is increased to $25.05 per cwt. COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts are unchanged relative to last month.  The projected marketing year average price received by upland producers is also unchanged, at 90 cents per pound.In the world 2021/22 cotton balance sheet, ending stocks are 1.7 million bales lower than a month earlier.  A 300,000-bale decrease in production accounts for some of this change, but most of the decline stems from lower beginning stocks, reflecting updated Indian consumption estimates for 2019/20 and 2020/21 to reflect Indian government sources.  Projected world 2021/22 consumption is marginally higher this month, up 111,000 bales, but with a 1-million-bale increase in the 2020/21 global estimate, March\u2019s projected consumption growth rate is lower this month.  World consumption is now expected to grow 2.1 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.8 percent rate forecast in February.  Production is projected lower as a 500,000-bale reduction in India\u2019s crop more than offsets a 150,000-bale increase for Mexico.",
    "December_2013": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 96.44 million tons, down slightly due to a small reduction in cottonseed.  Although soybean production remains unchanged, 2013/14 supplies are raised 10 million bushels on stronger-than-expected early season soybean imports.  Soybean exports are increased 25 million bushels to 1.475 billion reflecting record commitments (shipments plus outstanding sales) through November.  Soybean crush is raised 5 million bushels to 1.690 billion as strong foreign demand for soybean meal, led by the European Union and Southeast Asia, more than offsets a reduction in domestic soybean meal use.  Soybean oil supplies are increased in line with higher crush.  With total use unchanged, soybean oil stocks are increased 55 million pounds to 1.69 billion.  Although total use is unchanged, soybean oil used for methyl ester is projected lower reflecting expanded production of non-ester based renewable diesel.  Soybean ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 150 million bushels, down 20 million from last month.Prices for soybeans and soybean meal are projected higher this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2013/14 is projected at $11.50 to $13.50 per bushel, up 35 cents on both ends of the range.  The soybean meal price is projected at $400 to $440 per short ton, up 25 dollars on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price range is projected at 38 to 42 cents per pound, down 2 cents on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 502.3 million tons, up 2.9 million tons from last month.  Foreign oilseed production accounts for most of the change with increases for soybeans, rapeseed, and palm kernel only partly offset by reductions in cottonseed, sunflowerseed, and copra.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 284.9 million tons, up 1.4 million due to increases for Argentina and Canada.  Argentina production is projected at 54.5 million tons, up 1.0 million due to higher projected area.  Global rapeseed production is projected at a record 70.0 million tons, up 2.1 million due to gains for Canada and Australia. Canadian rapeseed production is raised 1.9 million tons to 18.0 million based on the latest survey results from Statistics Canada.  Favorable conditions throughout the growing season resulted in record rapeseed yields this year.  Other changes this month include lower sunflowerseed production for Argentina and increased cottonseed production for Pakistan.Global oilseed trade is projected at 128.3 million tons, up 1.6 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports from the United States and increased rapeseed exports from Canada account for most of the change.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 82.8 million tons, up 2.1 million as lower soybean stocks in the United States are more than offset by increased soybean stocks in Argentina, Canada, the European Union, and Russia, and higher rapeseed stocks in Canada and Australia.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 217,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, mainly due to lower imports from Mexico.  Total use is increased, as all of the forfeited sugar held by the Commodity Credit Corporation is expected to be sold for non-human use.  However, domestic food use is lowered based on recent weaker-than-expected deliveries.  Ending stocks are lowered 423,000 tons from last month.For Mexico, USDA is adopting recent projections by the government of Mexico for increased production and imports, compared with last month\u2019s WASDE projections.  Domestic consumption is decreased also to match government projections.  However, USDA projects stocks nearly unchanged from last month.  Mexico projects higher exports to non-U.S. markets which more than offsets lower exports to U.S. markets. For Mexico, USDA is adopting recent projections by the government of Mexico for increased production and imports, compared with last month\u2019s WASDE projections.  Domestic consumption is decreased also to match government projections.  However, USDA projects stocks nearly unchanged from last month.  Mexico projects higher exports to non-U.S. markets which more than offsets lower exports to U.S. markets. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total red meat and poultry production for both 2013 and 2014 are raised from November.  For 2013, small changes are made to the fourth quarter for the major species, based on slaughter data to date.  The forecast for 2014 is raised based on higher expected cattle and hog carcass weights and higher cattle slaughter.  No change is made to 2014 broiler production, but the turkey production forecast is reduced based on hatchery data.  Egg production is reduced slightly for both 2013 and early 2014.Beef imports are lowered slightly for 2013, but no change is made to 2014.  Beef exports are raised for both 2013 and 2014.  Pork imports are raised for both 2013 and 2014 based on estimates for the third quarter and early fourth quarter and expectations for slightly stronger imports in 2014.  Pork exports for 2013 and 2014 are reduced from last month based on slightly weaker demand in Asia. The 2013 broiler export forecast is lowered slightly based on exports to date, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Turkey exports are raised for 2013 but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.Cattle prices for 2013 and 2014 are raised from November as demand for fed cattle remains strong.  Hog prices for 2013 are lowered as fourth-quarter prices have been slightly weaker-than-expected.  The forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts for 2013 and 2014 are raised from last month.  Demand for broiler meat is firm, supported by expected tight supplies of beef and moderate production increases.  Turkey prices are expected to be supported by slower forecast growth in production.  Egg prices are forecast higher for 2013 and 2014, reflecting current price strength and lower forecast production.The 2013 milk production forecast is reduced slightly from last month, based on recent estimates of cow numbers.  The forecast for 2014 is raised as higher milk forecast prices and lower expected feed costs support a more rapid increase in cow numbers and output per cow. Fat basis imports are reduced for 2013 but are unchanged for 2014. On a skims-solids basis, imports are raised in 2013 but unchanged for 2014.  Exports are raised on a fats basis based on the strength of butterfat shipments to non-traditional markets.  On a skims-solids basis, higher nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey exports are offset by lower lactose exports leading to a lower forecast for 2013, but for 2014, expected strength in NDM results in a higher skim-solids forecast. For 2013, the cheese price forecast is reduced, reflecting current prices.  However, strength in current prices for butter, NDM, and whey resulted in higher price forecasts for those products.  For 2014, despite higher dairy production, demand strength in importing countries and improving domestic demand in the United States is expected to support prices for all products. The Class III milk price is unchanged for 2013 as lower forecast cheese prices offset higher whey prices but the forecast is raised for 2014 based on higher forecast cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price forecast is raised for both years on higher butter and NDM prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.90 to $20.00 per cwt for 2013 and $19.70 to $20.50 per cwt for 2014. COTTON:  This month\u2019s U.S. cotton estimates for 2013/14 are virtually unchanged from last month.  Production is estimated at 13.1 million bales, as decreases for the Southeastern states are mostly offset by increases in the Delta.  The forecasts for domestic mill use, exports, and ending stocks also are unchanged.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is forecast to range from 70-78 cents per pound, unchanged at the midpoint but narrowed one cent on each end. The world 2013/14 cotton estimates include higher beginning stocks, partially offset by lower production, raising ending stocks by less than 1 percent.  Beginning stocks are raised 1.0 million bales for India, based on prior-year reductions in India\u2019s consumption from official sources.  Production is reduced for China and Benin, but is raised for Pakistan.  Global consumption is virtually unchanged, but world import demand is reduced due mainly to larger available supplies in India and Pakistan.",
    "August_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2018/19 is projected at 135.6 million tons, up 7.7 million from last month mainly due to a higher soybean production forecast.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,586 million bushels, up 276 million on higher yields.  Harvested area is forecast at 88.9 million acres, unchanged from the July projection.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 51.6 bushels per acre is 3.1 bushels above last month and 2.5 bushels above last year.  As higher production more than offsets lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies for 2018/19 are projected at a record 5,040 million bushels, 5 percent above last month.  With larger supplies, crush and exports are raised 15 and 20 million bushels, respectively.  Ending stocks are projected at 785 million bushels, up 205 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2018/19 is forecast at $8.90 per bushel at the midpoint, down 35 cents from last month.  The soybean meal price forecast at $295 to $335 per short ton, down $20 at the midpoint. The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 28.0 to 32.0 cents per pound.U.S. soybean changes for 2017/18 include higher exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Exports are raised 25 million bushels to 2,110 million on strong export sales and shipments through July.  Crush is raised 10 million bushels to a record 2,040 million on strong soybean meal exports.  With increased crush and exports, soybean ending stocks are reduced 35 million bushels to 430 million.Global oilseed 2018/19 supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, crush, and stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production for 2018/19 is projected at 603.1 million tons, up 10.5 million with higher soybean, sunflowerseed, cottonseed, and peanut production partly offset by lower rapeseed.  Global soybean, peanut, and cottonseed crops are raised on higher U.S. production.  Sunflowerseed production is higher for the EU, benefitting from favorable weather conditions in southern and southeastern Europe.  Conversely, hot, dry weather in northern Europe resulted in a 1-million-ton reduction to EU rapeseed production.  Other oilseed production changes include higher sunflowerseed and rapeseed production for Russia and Ukraine due to beneficial weather conditions over the past few weeks.   Global oilseed exports for 2018/19 are projected at 182.5 million tons, up 1.2 million with higher soybean exports for the United States and higher rapeseed exports for Ukraine.  Global crush is raised 1.2 million tons to 501.8 million.  Lower soybean crush for China and rapeseed crush for the EU are offset by higher rapeseed crush for Russia and sunflowerseed crush for the EU, Russia, and Ukraine.  With larger increases to supply than use, global oilseed stocks are raised 8.3 million tons to 119.9 million.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for 2018/19 is projected up 71,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.107 million based on sugarbeet area and yield forecasts made by NASS in Crop Production. Beet sugar production for 2017/18 is reduced by 34,353 STRV to 5.241 million based on higher beet pile shrink estimated for the 2017/18 slicing campaign.  Based on NASS sugarcane yield and area harvested, 2018/19 cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 191,000 STRV to 1.781 million and cane sugar production in Florida is increased by 50,000 STRV to 2.050 million.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2017/18 are reduced by 135,000 STRV to 12.100 million based on pace to date and the corresponding projection for 2018/19 is reduced in line by 150,000 STRV to 12.250 million.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are estimated at 2.103 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 16.9 percent.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 2.261 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 18.1 percent.  Sugar supply and use in Mexico are unchanged from last month. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2018 is raised from last month as increases in broiler production more than offset declines in beef, pork, and turkey production.  Second-quarter broiler production is raised on June production data, while third-quarter production is raised on hatchery data and expected growth in bird weights. The decline in beef production largely reflects a slower pace of marketings in the third quarter.  Cow slaughter is raised, but recent carcass weight data and a larger proportion of cows in the slaughter mix led to a reduction in expected carcass weights during the second half of the year.  Pork production is reduced on a slower expected pace of slaughter during the last half of the year.  Forecast turkey production is reduced slightly from the previous month on June production data.  Egg production is increased on second-quarter production data.  For 2019, the pork production forecast is raised from the previous month on higher expected hog slaughter in the first part of the year and heavier carcass weights.  The beef production forecast is raised on heavier carcass weights in 2019.  Broiler production is also raised for 2019 on lower forecast feed prices.  Annual turkey and egg production forecasts for 2019 are unchanged from the previous month. For 2018, second-quarter beef imports are reduced on June trade data; the forecasts for the outlying quarters and into 2019 are unchanged.  Beef export forecasts are raised for both 2018 and 2019 on expectations of continued strong global demand.  Second-quarter pork imports for 2018 are lowered slightly on recent trade data, but the forecasts for the outlying quarters and into 2019 are unchanged.  The second-quarter pork export forecast is adjusted for June data; the forecast for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 is reduced slightly on expected competition in several markets.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts are reduced for both 2018 and 2019 on weaker-than-expected demand. Cattle and turkey price forecasts are unchanged at the midpoint for 2018 and 2019.  Hog and broiler price forecasts are lowered for 2018 and 2019.  The egg price forecast for 2018 is raised on recent price strength; no changes are made to the 2019 egg price forecasts.  The milk production forecast for 2018 is unchanged from last month.  The milk production forecast for 2019 is raised from the previous month on slightly higher cow numbers and increased milk per cow.  For 2018, fat basis exports are raised from the previous month on higher sales of butter and other fat-containing products.  The fat basis import forecast is also raised on higher expected imports of butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2018 is lowered on weaker sales of nonfat dry milk (NDM) and the imposition of tariffs by China on lactose and other dairy products.  The import forecast is unchanged.  For 2019, the fat basis import and export forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. Skim-solids basis exports are lowered on expected continued weak sales of lactose. The skim-solids import forecast for 2019 is reduced from the previous month on lower expected imports of milk protein concentrates.   For 2018, cheese, butter, NDM and whey price forecasts are raised for 2018.  Prices for cheese, NDM and whey are also raised for 2019 as demand strength is expected to carry into next year.  However, the 2019 butter price forecast remains unchanged from the previous month.  The 2018 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from the previous month to reflect the higher dairy product price forecasts.  For 2019, Class III price forecast is raised on higher forecast cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price forecast is raised on the stronger forecast NDM price.  The all milk price is raised to $16.10 to $16.30 per cwt for 2018, and is raised to $16.45 to $17.45 per cwt for 2019.COTTON: This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. cotton forecast includes higher beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production for the 2018 crop is raised 4 percent to 19.2 million bales, on this season\u2019s first survey-based production forecast.  NASS\u2019s survey indicates higher abandonment, but a higher average yield compared to last month\u2019s expectations.  Beginning stocks are raised 400,000 bales due to lower-than-expected 2017/18 exports and domestic consumption, and 2018/19 exports are 500,000 bales higher, at 15.5 million bales.  Ending stocks are 600,000 bales higher this month.  The midpoint of the marketing-year-average price is unchanged from last month, at 75 cents per pound.Projected world 2018/19 ending stocks are down 1 percent this month, due to a combination of lower beginning stocks and higher consumption offsetting higher production.  Beginning stocks are reduced 450,000 bales, reflecting both lower production and higher consumption estimates for 2017/18.  Production in 2018/19 is increased 400,000 bales, with higher expected crops in the United States, Argentina, and Turkey offsetting reduced crops in Uzbekistan, Australia, and Turkmenistan.  Consumption is raised 660,000 bales, led by a 300,000-bale increase for Pakistan, with smaller increases in Indonesia, Turkey, and other countries.",
    "February_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supplies are increased 5 million bushels to 3.46 billion on higher projected imports, mainly from Canada.  Soybean exports for 2013/14 are projected at 1.51 billion bushels, up 15 million from last month reflecting the record pace of shipments and sales through January.  While global imports are unchanged, increased export projections for the United States, Brazil, and Paraguay are offset by a reduction for Argentina.  Higher U.S. soybean meal exports are offset by reduced domestic use, leaving soybean crush unchanged at 1.7 billion bushels.  Residual use is reduced 10 million bushels this month on tightening supplies driven by heavy use to date and large outstanding export sales.  At 12 million bushels, projected residual use remains above the exceptionally low level of the past 2 marketing years.  Projected soybean ending stocks are unchanged at 150 million bushels.The 2013/14 season-average soybean price range is projected at $11.95 to $13.45, up 20 cents on both ends.  The soybean meal price is projected at $425 to $465 per short ton, up 10 dollars on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price projection is lowered 1.5 cents at the midpoint with the range narrowed to 34.5 to 37.5 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 506.0 million tons, up slightly from last month.  Global soybean production is raised 0.9 million tons to a record 287.7 million.  Soybean production for Brazil is projected at a record 90.0 million tons, up 1.0 million from last month on higher yields reflecting early harvest results in the center-west.  Prospects for the Argentina soybean crop have diminished due to an extended period of hot, dry weather through mid-January.  As a result, the crop is projected at 54.0 million tons, down 0.5 million from last month.  Global sunflowerseed production is projected at 43.3 million tons, down 0.4 million due to reduced prospects for Argentina.  Other changes include reduced cottonseed production for China, Pakistan, and Australia, and increased sunflowerseed and rapeseed production for Kazakhstan.Global oilseed and product supply and use changes this month include reduced soybean crush, soybean meal, and soybean exports for Argentina, reduced soybean meal imports for the European Union, and increased soybean and soybean meal exports for Brazil and the United States.  Global oilseed stocks are projected higher, mostly reflecting higher soybean stocks in Argentina.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 56,000 short tons, raw value (STRV), from last month with a 3,000 STRV decline in beginning stocks and a 53,000 STRV drop in sugar from sugarcane production in Florida.  Projected use is unchanged, leaving ending stocks at 14.91 percent of use, down from 15.37 percent in December.Mexico\u2019s projected 2013/14 sugar production is reduced 345,000 metric tons to 6.35 million, based on the pace to date.  Domestic consumption and total exports both decline with the smaller supply.  Exports to the United States are forecast unchanged from January indications in response to the wider price premium in the U.S. market.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2014 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as higher beef production is more than offset by lower pork, broiler, and turkey production.  For beef, relatively large cattle placements in the fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to carry through into the first half of 2014, which will result in higher slaughter in 2014.  Cow slaughter is also expected to remain relatively strong during the first half of 2014 with favorable cull cow prices.  Pork production is lowered as reports indicate that Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) continues to spread.  Broiler production is reduced on slower growth in slaughter.  Turkey production is reduced as recent eggs-set and poult placements remain below a year earlier.  Egg production is unchanged.  Estimates of 2013 meat and egg production are adjusted to reflect data for December. Beef import and export forecasts for 2014 are unchanged from last month.  Pork exports are lowered as tight supplies and high prices reduce competitiveness.  The broiler export forecast is lowered as weaker-than-expected December exports and recent weakness in leg quarter prices may reflect reduced demand.  Turkey exports are unchanged.  The egg export forecast is raised.  Meat and egg trade estimates for 2013 are updated based on data for December.  Cattle prices for 2014 are raised from last month, reflecting tight supplies and recent price strength for fed cattle.  The hog price forecast is raised on reduced supplies of market hogs and strong demand.  Broiler, turkey, and egg prices are raised on expected demand strength and reduced supplies of competing meats in 2014. The milk production forecast for 2014 is raised from last month on expected higher cow numbers in the second half of the year.  USDA\u2019s Cattle report estimated dairy replacement heifers expected to calve during 2014 were up about 2 percent from a year ago, while the number of milk cows was fractionally below a year ago.  Strong returns resulting from higher milk prices and moderate feed costs are expected to boost expansion later in the year.  Milk per cow is unchanged.  Fat-basis exports for 2014 are raised on increased sales of butter and cheese.  Skim-solids exports are lowered mostly on reduced exports of lactose.  Fat and skim-solid imports are unchanged.  For 2013, supply and use estimates for 2013 are updated based on data for December.  \u00a0Product price forecasts for cheese, butter, and whey are higher, supported by strong demand and price strength to date.  Nonfat dry milk (NDM) is lower for 2014 on expectations of competition from other exporters in second-half 2014.  The Class III price is raised on higher cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is down as lower NDM more than offsets greater butter.  The all milk price is forecast at $20.85-21.55 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton estimates for 2013/14 are unchanged, with ending stocks projected at 3 million bales.  The marketing-year average price is projected in a narrower range of 74-78 cents per pound, with the midpoint of 76 cents raised from 74.5 cents last month.The 2013/14 world cotton supply and demand estimates include lower production and ending stocks.  Global consumption is unchanged this month.  Production is lowered for China, where additional information about re-classing in Xinjiang indicates production is lower than previously thought.  Production is also reduced for Australia and Pakistan, but raised for Argentina, Greece, and others.  Offsetting export adjustments result in total trade being virtually unchanged.  World stocks are lowered to 96.5 million bales, with China accounting for 59 percent of the total.",
    "April_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2020/21 include higher exports, lower crush, residual use, and seed use.  Soybean exports are raised mainly reflecting record exports through the first half of the marketing year.  Soybean crush is reduced this month on a lower domestic soybean meal disappearance forecast and a higher projected extraction rate.  Seed use is reduced in line with plantings for the 2021/22 crop indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report.  Residual use is reduced based on indications in the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 120 million bushels, unchanged from the previous forecast.  The season-average soybean price is forecast at $11.25 per bushel, up 10 cents.  The soybean oil price is projected at 45.0 cents per pound, up 4 cents reflecting sharply higher prices in March.  Higher soybean oil prices are expected to continue in coming months as additional renewable fuel capacity comes online.  Soybean meal prices are unchanged at $400 per short ton.The 2020/21 global oilseed outlook includes higher production, exports, and stocks compared to last month.  Global production is raised 2.2 million tons to 598.0 million, with higher soybean, rapeseed, and peanut output partly offset by lower palm kernel, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed.Global soybean production is raised 1.4 million tons to 363.2 million, mainly reflecting a 2-million-ton increase to 136 million for Brazil.  Favorable crop conditions in Brazil\u2019s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and updated harvest results from national and state agencies support higher yields.  Partly offsetting is reduced soybean production for the EU-27+UK and Paraguay.  Rapeseed and peanut production are increased for India on higher area estimates.  Palm oil production is reduced for Malaysia on lower-than-expected output during January and February.  Global soybean crush is forecast lower mainly on lower crush for China, which is reduced 2 million tons to 96 million on the recent slow crushing pace.  Global soybean exports are increased 1.2 million tons to 170.9 million.  Brazil, Russia, and U.S. exports are revised higher while Paraguay and Ukraine shipments are lowered.  Global soybean ending stocks are raised 3.1 million tons to 86.9 million, largely on higher stocks for China and Brazil.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply and use for 2020/21 is unchanged from last month, with small offsetting changes within the balance sheet.  An increase in projected imports is offset by a reduction in production, and there are no changes in use.  High-tier imports are projected to increase 30,000 STRV to 200,000 on the strong pace set in the first half of the fiscal year and on oversubscribed imports of organic sugar beyond the remaining tranche that adds to sugar already being stored in bonded warehouses.  The USDA has been unable to receive confirmation of media reports of decreased export potential in certain raw sugar TRQ countries that would imply an increase in the raw sugar TRQ shortfall.  Cane sugar production in Florida is reduced 30,000 STRV to 2.170 million based on recent processors\u2019 reports which indicate lower sucrose recovery and lower area harvested.  Ending stocks remain at 1.848 million STRV for an unchanged stocks-to-use ratio of 15.1 percent.  There are no changes to the Mexico supply and use for 2020/21.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2021 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month on lower expected pork and turkey production.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month primarily on higher cattle slaughter in the second half of year, but production gains are partially offset by lighter carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered on a slower pace of slaughter through the remainder of the year, but this decline is partially offset by heavier hog weights.  USDA\u2019s March Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated that the December 2020-February 2021 pig crop was about one percent below year-earlier and producers indicated intentions to farrow about 3 percent fewer sows during March-May.  These hogs will be available for slaughter in the second half of 2021.  Annual broiler production is unchanged from the previous month while the turkey production forecast is reduced on recent production and hatchery data.  The 2021 egg production forecast is reduced from the previous month.  For 2021, the beef import forecast is reduced largely on weakness in imports from Australia while exports are unchanged.  The pork export forecast is raised on expectation of continued firm global demand for U.S. pork products.  The pork import forecast is also raised.  The turkey export forecast is raised on recent trade data.  No change is made to the broiler export forecast.  The 2021 cattle price forecast is raised on current price strength and firm demand.  The hog price forecast is raised from last month on recent price strength and lowered supply expectations.  The broiler price forecast is reduced, reflecting a lower first-quarter price and weaker demand while the turkey price forecast is raised slightly on lowered production.  The egg price forecast is lowered on recent price declines. Dairy production for 2021 is raised from last month, primarily on increased cow numbers.  The 2021 fat basis import forecast is reduced while fat basis exports are raised on higher shipments of cheese.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is reduced on lower imports of milk proteins and several other dairy products while the export forecast is raised on strong gains in shipments of skim milk powders and whey.  However, lactose shipments remain relatively weak.  Product price forecasts are raised on improving demand, both domestically and in international markets.  Prices of cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey are raised, boosting both Class III and Class IV prices.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is raised to $18.40 per cwt.  COTTON:  The 2020/21 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  The export forecast is raised 250,000 bales, to 15.75 million, based on the pace of recent sales and shipments.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 3.9 million bales, equivalent to 22 percent of total disappearance.  The marketing year price received by upland cotton producers is projected to average 68 cents per pound, a reduction of 1 cent from last month.With lower global 2020/21 beginning stocks this month\u2014combined with slightly lower production and higher consumption\u2014ending stocks are 1.1 million bales lower, while projected trade is more than 900,000 bales higher.  Largely driven by revised consumption in Vietnam for the previous year, 2020/21 beginning stocks are estimated 427,000 bales lower than in March.  Projected production is 276,000 bales lower than a month earlier, led by declines in Australia and Turkmenistan, and rising domestic textile demand in China accounts for much of the 387,000-bale increase in projected 2020/21 world cotton consumption.  World trade is raised 935,000 bales to its highest projected level in eight years, with China\u2019s projected imports up 750,000 bales from last month, and Bangladesh\u2019s up 200,000 bales.  Higher exports are now expected from Brazil, the United States, and Egypt.",
    "January_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is estimated at 107.4 million tons, down 0.2 million from last month.  Smaller canola, sunflowerseed, peanut, and cottonseed crops are partly offset by a larger soybean crop.  Soybean production is estimated at 3.56 billion bushels, up 8 million on a higher yield.  Harvested area is estimated at 75.0 million acres, down 0.6 million from the previous forecast, with the largest reductions for North Dakota and South Dakota.  Yield is estimated at 47.4 bushels per acre, up 0.5 bushels led by increases for Illinois and Indiana.  Soybean supplies are relatively unchanged as lower beginning stocks and imports offset higher production.  With crush and export forecasts unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 475 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $9.00 per bushel, up 15 cents in part reflecting stronger soybean oil prices.  The soybean oil price forecast is raised 3 cents to 34.0 cents per pound.  The soybean meal price forecast is reduced $5.00 to $305.00 per short ton.  Foreign oilseed 2019/20 production is up 0.2 million tons to 467.2 million, with higher sunflowerseed production partly offset by lower cottonseed, rapeseed, and palm kernel.  Sunflowerseed production is increased for Russia on higher yields.  Palm kernel and palm oil production are lowered for Malaysia due to dry weather conditions over the past year.  Lower global vegetable oil production paired with increasing demand results in a 9 percent year-over-year decline in vegetable oil stocks.  Other notable oilseed changes include a 0.5-million-ton increase to Chinese soybean crush due to a higher-than-expected pace to date.SUGAR:  Total U.S. sugar supply for 2019/20 is reduced by 99,566 short tons, raw value (STRV) on lower production, partially offset by increased imports.  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is estimated at 1.513 million STRV, a reduction of 199,453 based on preliminary industry reporting.  Production in Louisiana for September 2020 is expected to be in line with average production for the previous 5 years.  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is estimated at 4.444 million STRV, an increase of 76,890 based on NASS\u2019s estimate of sugarbeet production in the January Crop Production report.  High-tier tariff imports are increased 30,000 STRV to 100,000 based on pace and on favorable margins between U.S. and world refined sugar prices.  This increase is offset by a reduction of FTA imports due to lower-than-expected entries for the calendar year 2019 TRQs.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.556 million STRV implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.7 percent, down from 13.5 percent last month. The only change for the projected 2019/20 Mexico supply and use balance is a 4,000 metric ton increase for imports intended for consumption based on the pace to date. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2019 total red meat and poultry production estimate is reduced from last month as lower pork and turkey production more than offset higher beef production.  The beef production estimate is raised on the pace of late-year slaughter.  The pork production estimate is reduced on the slower pace of slaughter in late 2019.  The broiler production estimate is unchanged from the previous month, but the turkey production estimate is lowered or recent production data.  The egg production estimate is raised on late-2019 production data.  For 2020, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is increased fractionally from last month as higher broiler production more than offsets lower expected beef, pork, and turkey production.  The 2020 beef production forecast is reduced on lighter expected carcass weights.  However, quarterly beef production was increased in the first half of the year and reduced in the second half of the year due to higher-than-expected cattle placements in late 2019 and a reduced placement forecast for early 2020.  USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report on January 31, providing estimates of heifers held for breeding and an insight into the number of feeder cattle available for placement during 2020.  The pork production forecast for 2020 is reduced from the previous month.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the 2019 September-November pig crop 2 percent higher than the prior year which supports a higher first-half 2020 slaughter and production forecast.  The report also indicated producers intend to expand farrowings about 1 percent in the first half of 2020, which coupled with adjustments to the rate of growth in pigs per litter, results in reduced hog slaughter forecast for the second half of 2020.  Forecast broiler production is raised for 2020 on recent hatchery data which points to continued expansion of laying flocks.  The turkey production forecast is reduced, while the egg production forecast is raised on gains in the laying flock.  The beef import forecast is increased for 2019 on recent trade data.  No change is made to the 2020 import forecast.  The 2019 beef export forecast is reduced to reflect a slower export pace late in the year, but no change is made to the 2020 beef export forecast.  The pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are unchanged from the previous month.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is raised on recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2020 export forecast.Livestock and poultry price estimates for 2019 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  For 2020, the first-quarter cattle price is raised, reflecting current early-year price strength.  First-half hog price forecasts are reduced on current prices and increased production.  Broiler prices are lowered as higher forecast production weighs on markets.  Turkey price forecasts for 2020 are raised on lower production and continued demand recovery.  Egg price forecasts are lowered on recent price weakness and increased production. Milk production forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are lowered from December on slower expected growth in milk per cow.  The 2019 fat basis import forecast is unchanged from last month, but the 2020 import forecast is reduced on lower expected cheese and butterfat imports. The fat basis export forecast for 2019 and 2020 is raised on recent trade data and strong sales of cheese and other dairy-containing products.  On a skim-solids basis, the 2019 and 2020 import forecasts are unchanged.  Skim-solids basis export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised on strong global demand for nonfat dry milk (NDM). Dairy product price estimates for 2019 include December price data.  For 2020, cheese, butter, and whey price forecasts are reduced on demand weakness and relatively high stocks.  The NDM price forecast is raised from December on continued strength in demand from export markets.  The Class III price and Class IV price are lowered from the previous month.  The 2019 all milk estimate is unchanged at $18.60, but the 2020 all milk price forecast is reduced to $19.25 per cwt. COTTON:  This month\u2019s outlook for U.S. cotton in 2019/20 includes lower production and ending stocks compared with last month, while domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  Production is lowered 100,000 bales, mainly due to a decline in Texas which was partially offset in other States. Ending stocks are 100,000 bales lower this month at 5.4 million bales.  Upland cotton season-average price received by farmers is projected 2 cents higher than a month ago at 63 cents per pound, based on stronger-than-expected early season prices.The global 2019/20 cotton forecasts include lower production, trade, and ending stocks. Production is forecast 630,000 bales lower, and changes for 2019/20 this month, other than the United States, include decreases for Turkey, Australia, Mali, and Pakistan.  World consumption is virtually unchanged as an increase in Uzbekistan\u2019s expected use is offset by declines for Bangladesh and Vietnam.  World trade in 2019/20 is projected 550,000 bales lower, largely due to a 500,000-bale drop in China\u2019s expected imports.  Smaller declines for Bangladesh and Vietnam are offset by increases for Turkey and Pakistan.  Exports are 200,000 bales lower for India and Uzbekistan, and also lower for Australia and Mali.  Global 2019/20 ending stocks are 730,000 bales lower this month.  At 79.6 million bales, total ending stocks are projected about unchanged from 2018/19, but stocks outside of China are expected 3.0 million bales above the year before.",
    "October_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2021/22 is forecast at 130.8 million tons, up 1.5 million from last month with higher soybean production partly offset by lower forecasts for sunflowerseed, canola, peanuts, and cottonseed.  Soybean production is forecast at 4.4 billion bushels, up 74 million on higher yields.  Harvested area is unchanged at 86.4 million acres.  The soybean yield is projected at 51.5 bushels per acre, up 0.9 bushels from the September forecast.  The largest production changes are for Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska.  Soybean supplies for 2021/22 are projected at 4.7 billion bushels, up 145 million on higher production and beginning stocks.  With higher crush and unchanged exports, 2021/22 ending stocks are projected at 320 million bushels, up 135 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2021/22 is forecast at $12.35 per bushel, down 55 cents reflecting larger supplies.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $325.00 per short ton, down $35.00.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 65 cents per pound.Foreign 2021/22 oilseed production is lowered 2.4 million tons to 497.4 million on lower soybean, sunflowerseed, and rapeseed output.  Soybean production is lowered for Argentina, India, and the EU.  Argentina\u2019s production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 51.0 million on lower harvested area.  Sunflowerseed production is lowered for Ukraine and Russia on recent harvest results.  Canola production for Canada is lowered 1.0 million tons to 13.0 million, reflecting reports by Statistics Canada. Global soybean supply and demand forecasts for 2021/22 include higher beginning stocks, lower crush, and higher ending stocks.  Higher beginning stocks reflect increases for the United States, Argentina, and China.  Argentina\u2019s beginning stocks are raised on a downward revision to 2020/21 crush.  The 2021/22 crush for Argentina is also lowered, leading to lower exports of meal and oil.  China\u2019s 2020/21 crush is lowered 1.0 million tons to 93.0 million based on end of year data.  Global soybean ending stocks for 2021/22 are increased 5.7 million tons to 104.6 million, with higher stocks for the United States, Argentina, and China.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2021/22 is increased by 145,945 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.348 million.  NASS increased its forecast of national sugarbeet production by 1.063 million tons to 35.675 million.  The largest gains were in the Upper Midwest at 6.13 percent on increased yield of 27.7 tons/acre and the Great Plains at 1.71 percent on increased area.  Louisiana cane sugar production for the September-August crop year is reduced by 2.29 percent to 1.783 million STRV.  NASS forecasts a lower yield of 32.2 tons/acre, slightly offset by processors\u2019 forecast of slightly more sugarcane area for sugar.  Fiscal year (FY) production is increased by 20,623 over the crop year total as the 2021 sugar campaign started later than originally expected and sugar expected to be produced in September is now projected to be produced after October 1 of FY 2021/22.  Louisiana cane sugar production is therefore 1.804 million STRV for FY 2021/22 and 1.928 million for 2020/21. On August 24, 2021, the USDA increased the 2020/21 raw sugar TRQ by 99,318 STRV and also extended the TRQ entry period through October 31, 2021.  The proportion of the sugar entering in September was higher than what was expected last month.  As a consequence, imports entering under this raw sugar TRQ are increased by 64,494 STRV for 2020/21 and decreased by the same amount for 2021/22.  Raw sugar TRQ imports for 2021/22 are further reduced by 151,556 STRV as the Philippines is not expected to export any of the raw TRQ sugar allocated to it by USTR.  The raw sugar TRQ shortfall is thereby raised to 250,764 STRV.  High tier tariff sugar imports for 2020/21 are increased by 25,000 STRV to 205,000 on the pace to date but remain at 75,000 STRV for 2021/22. Sugar use for 2021/22 is unchanged from last month but estimated higher in 2020/21 by 14,000 STRV with increased deliveries under the product re-export and polyhydric alcohol programs only partially offset by fewer deliveries for livestock feed.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are estimated marginally higher at 1,680,512 STRV while stocks for 2021/22 are projected lower by 38,361 STRV to 1,627,232.  The 2021/22 ending stocks-to-use ratio is projected at 13.2 percent, down slightly from 13.5 percent last month. Mexico sugar production for 2021/22 is projected at 5.940 million metric tons (MT), an increase of 131,000 over last month and 3.9 percent greater than production in 2020/21.  Reports indicate that plentiful rain has alleviated much of the lingering drought effects that afflicted the previous two growing seasons.  Area harvested, sugarcane yields, and sucrose recoveries are all expected to be at levels close to averages over the period since 2013/14.  Exports for 2020/21 are reduced by 184,290 MT due primarily to more sugar going into deliveries for IMMEX (59,329 MT) and into ending stocks (96,754 MT).  CEDES program for stocks intended for export in the fourth quarter of 2021/22 are estimated at 28,118 MT.  Deliveries for human consumption are also increased by small amounts for 2020/21 (20,000 MT) and 2021/22 (15,000 MT).  IMMEX for 2021/22 is increased, as well, by 18,000 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2021 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower pork, broiler, and turkey forecasts more than offset a higher beef forecast.  Beef production is raised from the previous month as lower expected steer and heifer slaughter are more than offset by higher cow slaughter and heavier average carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is reduced on lower expected fourth-quarter hog slaughter.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced on recent hatchery and slaughter data.  The egg production forecast is reduced slightly.  For 2022, the total red meat and poultry forecast is reduced from the previous month.  Although higher expected placements of cattle in second half 2021 are expected to support higher early-year supplies of fed cattle, placements in the first half of 2022 are lowered and fed cattle supplies in the second half or 2022 are expected to be tighter.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on September 24, estimated a lower pig crop for June-August and lower farrowing intentions for September-November.  This supports lower hog slaughter expectations for first half 2022.  Slower expected growth in pigs per litter during 2022 resulted in lower expected hog supplies in the second half of the year.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced on expectations of a relatively slow response to improving margins.  The 2022 egg production forecast is unchanged.     For 2021 and 2022, beef import forecasts are raised reflecting continued strength in demand while the export forecasts are unchanged.  The pork import forecasts are raised on increased supplies of pork on the global market.  The pork export forecast for 2021 is reduced on weaker expected demand from China and increased competition in global markets; however, exports are increased for 2022 as growth in several key markets recovers.  The broiler export forecast for 2021 is raised slightly, but no change is made to the 2022 forecast.  Turkey export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are lowered from last month.  Fed cattle prices for 2021 are lowered on current price movements and relatively large supplies of fed cattle.  However, the 2022 price forecast is raised on tighter expected supplies of cattle.  The 2021 and 2022 hog price forecasts are raised on lower expected hog supplies.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised for 2021 and 2022 on lowered production.Milk production forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced from last month on smaller dairy cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow.  For 2021 and 2022, fat basis import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month, while the fat basis export forecasts are raised on stronger expected sales of cheese and butterfat containing products.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2021 is lowered slightly on weaker expected imports of milk protein concentrates, but the 2022 forecast is unchanged.  Skim-solids basis export forecast for 2021 is reduced on weaker sales of skim milk powder, whey, and lactose; however, the forecast for 2022 is unchanged. For 2021, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey price forecasts are raised on current prices and lower expected production.  The butter price is lowered slightly on current prices.  For 2022, all dairy product prices are raised, largely on tighter supplies.  The 2021 and 2022 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from last month on higher dairy product prices.  The 2021 all milk price is forecast higher at $18.45 per cwt.  The all milk price forecast for 2022 is $19.20 per cwt. COTTON:  The 2021/22 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show lower production, lower ending stocks, and a higher price compared with last month.  Production is lowered 3 percent, to 18.0 million bales as projected yields in Texas are reduced.  With domestic mill use and exports unchanged, ending stocks are 500,000 bales lower.  At 3.2 million bales, U.S. ending stocks in 2021/22 are projected at 18 percent of use, compared with 17 percent in 2020/21.  The 2021/22 season-average farm price for upland cotton is forecast at a record-high 90.0 cents per pound, 6 cents higher than last month and nearly 2 percent above the previous record of 88.3 cents in 2011/12.The global cotton 2021/22 balance sheet shows lower consumption, higher production, and higher ending stocks compared with last month.  During the first weeks of October 2021, world cotton prices have averaged over 115 cents per pound, up at least 40 percent from both year-earlier and long-run levels.  While world income growth and spending on goods are expected to remain high during 2021/22, projected annual world cotton consumption growth is now 2.9 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in September.  China\u2019s consumption is reduced 1 million bales as, in addition to high prices, lagging energy production there cuts into industrial capacity.  Consumption is also lower this month in Vietnam, but higher in Pakistan and Turkey.  World production is 700,000 million bales higher, largely due to an increase in Pakistan.  Production is also higher in Turkey, but lower in India as well as the United States.  World ending stocks in 2021/22 are projected 450,000 bales higher than in September, but 3.2 million bales below 2020/21.",
    "October_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is projected at 107.9 million tons, down 2.3 million from last month with lower soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production partly offset by higher canola and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is forecast at 3.6 billion bushels, down 83 million, mainly on lower yields.  The soybean yield is projected at 46.9 bushels per acre, down 1 bushel from the September forecast.  Harvested area is reduced slightly to 75.6 million acres.  Soybean supplies for 2019/20 are forecast at 4.5 billion bushels down 175 million on lower production and beginning stocks.  With a small increase in soybean crush, ending stocks are projected at 460 million bushels, down 180 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $9.00 per bushel, up 50 cents reflecting smaller supplies.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $325.00 per short ton, up $20.00.  The soybean oil price forecast is raised 0.5 cents to 30.0 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2019/20 is projected at 574.8 million tons, down 4.6 million from last month on lower soybean, sunflowerseed, rapeseed, and peanut production.  Global soybean production is projected at 339.0 million tons, down 2.4 million to a 4-year low, mainly reflecting lower production for the United States.  Global rapeseed production is forecast lower on reductions for Canada, Australia, the EU, and the United States.  Canadian rapeseed production is reduced on lower yield prospects resulting from an unseasonably heavy snow and a season-ending freeze.  Other production changes include lower sunflowerseed production for Ukraine, lower cottonseed production for Pakistan and Brazil, and higher cottonseed production for India.  With lower global oilseed supplies only partly offset by reduced crush, global oilseed stocks are projected at 109.8 million tons, down 4.6 million.  Soybeans account for most of the change with lower stocks in the United States only partly offset by increases for Argentina and Brazil.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.055 million short tons, raw value (STRV), up 50,000 on less expected production for September of 2018/19 now expected to be produced during 2019/20.  Beet sugar production for 2018/19 is correspondingly reduced by 50,000 STRV to 4.907 million. Raw sugar TRQ imports for the 2018/19 quota year eligible for entry until October 15 are estimated at 1.141 million STRV, implying a shortfall of 57,088.  The amount of this sugar entered by September 30 was 24,018 STRV less than expected last month; 22,046 STRV of it is now projected to enter in October.  Expected imports of 17,907 STRV corresponding to calendar year FTA TRQs are shifted from the July-September quarter to the October-December quarter and into the 2019/20 fiscal year.  Re-export imports for 2018/19 are estimated at 437,682 STRV, up 17,682 over last month.  High-tier tariff imports are estimated at 92,679 STRV, up 2,679 over last month. Deliveries for human consumption for 2018/19 are decreased by 50,000 STRV to 12.125 million based on a slower-than-expected pace.  Corresponding deliveries for 2019/20 are decreased in line by the same amount.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are estimated at 1.725 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.04 percent.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 1.784 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.52 percent.For 2018/19, Mexico sugar deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 95,977 metric tons, actual weight (MT) to 4.140 million based on the slow pace through the end of August reported by CONADESUCA.  Deliveries to IMMEX are likewise reduced by 55,000 MT to 425,000.  Exports are increased 14,203 MT based on CONADESUCA reporting.  Imports, mainly for IMMEX, are increased by 16,189 MT.  Ending stocks are residually estimated at 1.148 million MT of which an estimated 273,168 are required to be exported in 2019/20 before December 31 per provisions administered by the Fideicomiso Maestro para la Exportaci\u00f3n de Excedentes de los Ingenios (FIMAE).For 2019/20, Mexico sugar production is projected at 6.065 million MT, a reduction of 135,000 based on updated reports of the severity of drought conditions in several producing areas.  Total sweetener deliveries are projected at 5.719 million MT based on the same per capita sweetener consumption from 2018/19 multiplied by the expected increase in population.  Deliveries of high fructose corn syrup are projected at 1.520 million MT, dry weight, implying sugar deliveries of 4.199 million MT.  Ending stocks are at 963,373 MT, an amount meant to meet consumption for a 2.5 month period before the start of the next harvest campaign.  Exports are residually projected at 1.695 million MT, an increase of 201,607 over last month.  Exports to the United States are unchanged from last month at 956,738 MT. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2019 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month, as higher broiler production more than offsets slightly lower beef and turkey production.  Pork production is unchanged.  Hatchery and slaughter data supports an increase in broiler production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month on a slower-than-expected pace of fed cattle slaughter.  The turkey forecast is lowered on a slower pace of third-quarter production.  The 2019 egg production forecast is raised slightly. For 2020, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month on higher expected pork and broiler production.  Beef production is unchanged for the year, although a slower pace of placements in third-quarter 2019 is expected to result in lower first-quarter beef production, but higher second quarter production.  Pork production is forecast higher, as expected growth in pigs per litter points toward increased availability of slaughter hogs in 2020.  The broiler production forecast is raised from the previous month on expectations of continued expansion of broiler flocks.  Turkey production forecasts are reduced from the previous month on higher feed prices. The egg production forecast is raised, largely reflecting increased hatching egg production.The 2019 beef import forecast is unchanged, but exports are reduced, reflecting recent trade data.  For 2020, imports are reduced, reflecting tighter supplies from Oceania and strong demand for beef by competing importers.  Exports are raised on firm global demand and tightness in supplies from Oceania.  The 2019 and 2020 pork export forecasts are raised from the previous month on recent trade data and strong demand U.S. pork products.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is lowered, reflecting recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2020 export forecast.  Turkey trade export forecasts are raised.         The cattle price forecast for 2019 is raised on current price strength; this increase in price strength was carried into early 2020.  Hog price forecasts are reduced for 2019 and 2020 on larger supplies of hogs.  The 2019 broiler price forecast is raised on recent price strength but is reduced for 2020 as broiler meat supplies are raised.  The 2019 turkey price forecast is higher on recent gains in prices, but the 2020 forecast is unchanged.  The 2019 egg price forecast is lowered on current prices, but 2020 egg price forecasts are unchanged. Milk production forecasts for 2019 are raised on higher cow numbers and stronger growth in milk per cow.  For 2020, expected continued gains in milk per cow supported an increase in the milk production forecast.Annual forecasts of imports on both a fat and skims-solids basis are unchanged for 2019 reflecting current trade data, but forecasts for 2020 are lowered as the recently announced additional tariffs on a number of EU dairy products are expected to result in reduced imports.  Fat basis export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are reduced from last month on continued competitive pressure on U.S. cheese exports. The 2019 skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered on weaker expected exports of cheese and skim and nonfat dry milk (SMP/NDM).  However, increased strength in SMP/NDM sales in 2020 due to strong global demand is expected to more than offset continued weakness in cheese exports.  The 2020 skim-solids basis export forecast is raised.  For 2019, cheese and NDM prices are raised from the previous month, but price forecasts for butter and whey are reduced.  The Class III price is raised from last month as the higher cheese price more than offsets the lower whey price; the Class IV price is raised as the higher NDM price more than offsets the lower butter price.  For 2020, cheese and NDM prices are raised from the previous month, but the price forecast for butter is reduced.  The whey price is unchanged.  As a result, the Class III price forecast is higher, but the Class IV price is lowered, as the higher NDM price is more than offset by the lower butter price.  The 2019 all milk price is forecast higher at $18.40; for 2020 the price is unchanged at $18.85 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2019/20 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show slightly lower production and ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is lowered less than 1 percent, to 21.7 million bales, largely the result of a reduction in Texas.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged from last month, and ending stocks are reduced 200,000 bales.  At 7.0 million bales, U.S. ending stocks in 2019/20 are projected at 36 percent of use, compared with 27 percent in 2018/19.  The 2019/20 season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 58 cents per pound, unchanged from last month and 12.5 cents lower than in 2018/19.The 2019/20 global cotton supply and demand forecasts show little overall change from last month.  World production is 130,000 bales lower as declines for Brazil, Pakistan, Australia, and the United States more than offset a 1-million-bale increase in India.  Global consumption is 130,000 bales lower than September\u2019s forecast and the projection for world trade in 2019/20 is reduced 300,000 bales.  Lower expected imports for China and Vietnam more than offset increases for Pakistan and Turkey.  Exports for Australia and Brazil are also lower.  World ending stocks in 2019/20 are now forecast at 83.7 million bales, virtually unchanged from the September forecast but 3.0 million bales higher than in 2018/19. ",
    "January_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is estimated at 131.3 million tons, down 0.9 million from last month.  Smaller soybean, peanut, and cottonseed crops are partly offset by increases for canola and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is estimated at 4,392 million bushels, down 33 million on lower yields.  Harvested area is estimated at 89.5 million acres, up fractionally from the previous forecast.  Yield is estimated at 49.1 bushels per acre, down 0.4 bushels, led by reductions for Kansas, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  The soybean crush forecast is raised 10 million bushels to 1,950 million.  Soybean meal production is unchanged as the higher crush is offset by a lower extraction rate.  Soybean exports are reduced 65 million bushels to 2,160 million, reflecting lagging sales commitments through December and increased competition with higher soybean production and export forecasts for Brazil.  Ending stocks are projected at 470 million bushels, up 25 million from the previous forecast.The 2017/18 U.S. season-average farm price for soybeans is projected at $8.80 to $9.80 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price forecast of 32 to 35 cents per pound is lowered 1 cent at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price forecast is unchanged at $295 to $335 per short ton.Global oilseed production is projected at 580.1 million tons, up 0.5 million.  Soybean production is raised 0.1 million tons to 348.6 million on gains for Brazil and the EU that are partly offset by lower production for Argentina and the United States.  The Brazil soybean crop is increased 2 million tons to 110 million reflecting higher yield estimates in recent government reports.  Soybean production for Argentina is reduced 1 million tons to 56 million on lower area planted to date, particularly in northern Argentina.  Other changes include higher rapeseed production for Ukraine and lower sunflowerseed production for Argentina.Global oilseed trade for 2017/18 is projected at 176.0 million tons, down 0.4 million from last month.  Lower U.S. soybean and Australian rapeseed shipments are partly offset by increased soybean exports for Brazil and rapeseed for Ukraine.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 111.2 million tons, up 0.4 million mainly on higher soybean stocks for Brazil and the United States and higher rapeseed stocks for Australia.  Partly offsetting are lower soybean stocks for Argentina and sunflowerseed stocks for the EU.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2017/18 is increased by 72,353 short tons, raw value (STRV), mainly due to increases in expected cane sugar production partially offset by a decrease in beet sugar production.  Louisiana cane sugar production for 2017/18 is increased by 130,000 STRV to 1.820 million due to a strong harvest campaign that is expected to extend into mid-January, according to industry reporting.  Florida cane sugar production is increased by 39,038 STRV to 2.075 million based on processors\u2019 estimates of sugar yield per acre made at the end of December.  Beet sugar production for 2017/18 is decreased by 102,455 STRV to 5.257 million based on lower sugarbeet production reported by NASS.  Additionally, beginning stocks are increased by 15,438 STRV based on inventory revisions submitted by processors to Sweetener Market Data.  These supply increases are slightly offset by a reduction of 9,668 STRV due to fewer imports forecast to enter under FTA tariff-rate quotas.  U.S. sugar use for 2017/18 is increased by a 50,000-STRV export increase consisting mostly of shipments to Mexico, part of which is expected to be under the U.S. re-export program. Ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 1.824 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.4 percent. In Mexico, an increase in imports of 40,000 metric tons (MT) is offset by an increase in exports to non-U.S. destinations.  The ending stocks total for 2017/18 remains at 1.008 million MT, an amount to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption before the next season harvest.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The estimate of 2017 total red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month.  Based on preliminary data, beef and turkey production estimates are lowered, more than offsetting higher pork and broiler production.  The egg production estimate is raised modestly on late-2017 production data.  For 2018, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is raised as higher expected pork, beef, and broiler production offsets lower turkey production.  The 2018 beef production forecast is raised as higher cattle placements in late 2017 are expected to result in higher fed cattle marketings and slaughter in the first half of 2018.  Average carcass weights are also expected to be heavier. USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report on January 31, providing estimates of heifers held for breeding and an insight into the number of feeder cattle available for placement during 2018.  The pork production forecast for 2018 is raised.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the September-November pig crop was 3 percent above 2016 which supports a higher first half production forecast.  The report also indicated producers expect to expand farrowings about 3 percent in the first half of the year which, coupled with continued gains in pigs per litter, supports higher second-half production.  Forecast broiler production is raised for 2018 on favorable returns.  Turkey production is reduced based on continued weak demand.  The egg production forecast is raised slightly. Beef imports are increased for 2017 on increased shipments from Oceania.  No change is made to exports.  Pork exports for 2017 are raised reflecting the pace of trade to date but no change is made to pork imports.  Broiler imports and exports are raised for 2017, reflecting recent trade data.  For 2018, livestock, broiler, and egg trade forecasts remain unchanged from last month.  Livestock and poultry price estimates for 2017 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  For 2018, the cattle price is raised, reflecting early-year price strength. The first-quarter 2018 hog price forecast is raised, reflecting recent price strength and firm demand. First and second quarter broiler and egg price forecasts are raised as well on recent price strength and continued strong demand. Turkey price forecasts for 2018 are lowered on recent price movements and continued weakness in demand.The milk production estimate for 2017 is reduced on recent data.  For 2018, the milk production estimate is reduced on slower anticipated growth in the dairy cow herd combined with continued slow growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis imports for 2017 are reduced on slower butter imports, but exports are raised on solid global demand for U.S. butter and other dairy products.  Skim-solids basis imports are reduced modestly while exports are raised on strong demand for skim milk powder and several other products.  For 2018, the fat basis import forecast is reduced on slowing demand for butter products, while the export forecast is raised on expected robust foreign demand for U.S. fat-containing products.  On a skim-solids basis, the 2018 import forecast is reduced on weak demand for U.S. milk protein concentrates.  The 2018 skim-solids basis export forecast is raised reflecting stronger demand for a number of products.     Dairy product prices for 2017 are adjusted for December data.  For 2018, all dairy product prices are reduced on slowing domestic demand and global competition.  The Class III and Class IV price forecasts for 2018 are reduced on lower product prices.  The all milk price is lowered to $15.80 to $16.60 per cwt for 2018.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. cotton forecasts include slightly lower production and ending stocks.  Production is reduced 177,000 bales due to small declines in regions outside the Delta.  Ending stocks are reduced 100,000 bales, while domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  The forecast for the marketing year average price received by producers is raised 3 cents per pound, to a midpoint of 69 cents.Offsetting changes in foreign production and consumption characterize the global 2017/18 cotton forecasts this month.  Global production is raised 1.0 million bales as a 1.4-million-bale increase for China is only partly offset by small decreases in India, the United States, and Australia.  Global consumption is raised 1.2 million bales largely due to a 1.0-million-bale increase for China.  World consumption is forecast to grow at a 5.2 percent annual rate in 2017/18, more than double its long-run level.

    "April_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2018/19 include lower imports, higher seed use, and lower ending stocks.  Soybean imports are reduced in line with reported trade through January while lower seed use reflects plantings indicated in the March 29 Prospective Plantings report.  With soybean crush and exports unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 895 million bushels, down 5 million.  Soybean oil changes include increased imports and domestic disappearance for biodiesel and for food use, and lower ending stocks.  The season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.35 to $8.85, unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean oil price is projected at 28.0 to 30.0 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $305 to $325 per short ton, unchanged at the midpoint.The 2018/19 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include increased production, lower exports, and increased stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is raised 2.0 million tons to 595.0 million mainly on higher soybean production for Brazil and rapeseed production for India.  Production for Brazil is increased 0.5 million tons to 117.0 million, reflecting favorable weather in Rio Grande do Sul where the crop is in pod-filling and maturation stages.  Brazil\u2019s 2017/18 soybean crop is also revised higher, supported by recent industry estimates.  Rapeseed production for India is raised 1.4 million tons to 8 million on information from India\u2019s Solvent Extractors\u2019 Association. Global oilseed exports are reduced 1.0 million tons to 177.1 million mainly on lower rapeseed trade between Canada and China.  With lower rapeseed crush for China, imports are increased for other products, including sunflowerseed meal, rapeseed meal, palm oil, and soybean oil.  Global oilseed ending stocks are raised 1.5 million tons to 123.2 million, largely due to higher soybean stocks for Brazil and rapeseed stocks for Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2018/19 is decreased 42,457 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on processor-reported reductions to beet sugar production and cane sugar production in Florida.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 1.625 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.2 percent.  There are no changes to the 2018/19 Mexico sugar supply and use.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2019 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month on lower expected beef, pork and broiler production.  The beef production forecast is reduced from the previous month primarily on lower carcass weights, but higher total cattle slaughter for 2019 is expected to partially offset declines in carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered on a slower pace of slaughter throughout the year, but this decline is partially offset by slightly higher hog weights.  USDA\u2019s March Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated producers farrowed 2 percent more sows during December-February and indicated their intentions to farrow about 1 percent more sows in March-May.  These hogs will be ready for slaughter in the second half of 2019.  Broiler production is reduced on recent hatchery data and slowing weight growth while turkey production is raised slightly.  The 2019 egg production forecast is raised from the previous month as the pace of expansion has been more rapid than previously expected.  For 2019, beef trade forecasts are unchanged from last month. Pork imports remain unchanged from the previous month, but the export forecast is raised on expectations of stronger global demand for U.S. pork products in the second half of the year.  These forecasts assume that current trade policies remain in place.  No change is made to broiler and turkey export forecasts.  The 2019 cattle price forecast is adjusted to reflect a slightly lower first-quarter price.  The hog price forecast is raised from last month but demand in coming quarters is not expected to be as strong as in March and early April.  The broiler price forecast is reduced, reflecting a lower first-quarter price, while modest year-over-year gains in turkey prices support a higher price forecast.  The egg price forecast is lowered on recent price declines and increased production throughout the year. The milk production forecast for 2019 is lowered from last month as higher milk cow numbers are more than offset by lower expected growth in milk per cow for the year.  The 2019 fat basis import forecast is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is lowered on slower expected shipments of butterfat products and whey products.  On a skim-solids basis, the current import forecast is raised on higher imports of milk protein products and a number of other dairy products.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered from last month on lower shipments of whey products, lactose, and nonfat dry milk (NDM).  The annual product price forecast for cheese is raised from last month on higher current prices and expected stronger demand.  Butter, NDM, and whey prices are reduced from the previous month on current prices and expected weaker demand.  The Class III price is raised on the higher cheese price forecast while the Class IV price is reduced on lower NDM and butter price forecasts. The all milk price forecast is raised to $17.25 to $17.75 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2018/19 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show lower consumption and higher ending stocks relative to last month.  At 3.1 million bales, U.S. cotton consumption is now forecast to reach its lowest level since the 1890s.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 4.4 million bales, a 100,000-bale increase from both the previous 2018/19 estimate and from the current estimate for 2017/18.  The season-average farm price is unchanged with a mid-point of 70 cents per pound. Lower world consumption this month results in higher projected 2018/19 ending stocks, with little net change in the other components of the global balance sheet.  World mill use is forecast about 400,000 bales lower this month.  A 300,000-bale decline in Turkey\u2014and smaller declines in the United States and Vietnam\u2014more than offset smaller increases elsewhere.  Lower imports for India, Turkey, and Vietnam are largely offset by an upward revision for China.  Lower exports for India and Burkina Faso are largely offset by Australia and Turkey.  Higher production for China is largely offset by a decline for Burkina Faso.World ending stocks in 2018/19 are forecast about 360,000 bales higher this month, with an increase in China\u2019s stocks more than offsetting a decline in stocks outside of China.",

    "December_2017": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 132.2 million tons, up slightly due to a small increase in cottonseed.  Soybean exports are reduced 25 million bushels to 2,225 million on stronger-than-expected competition from Argentina and Brazil during the first quarter of the marketing year.  Seed use is raised in line with projected plantings in the recently released tables to be included in the upcoming Long Term Agricultural Projections to 2027 report https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/projections.htm.  Soybean ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 445 million bushels, up 20 million from last month and still the highest since 2006/07.Following the December 5, 2017 affirmative determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission regarding countervailing duties on biodiesel imports from Argentina and Indonesia, soybean oil used for domestic production of methyl ester is raised 500 million pounds to 7.5 billion.  Reduced soybean oil exports and non-ester domestic use are offsetting, leaving projected ending stocks unchanged at 1.62 billion pounds.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2017/18 is narrowed to $8.60 to $10.00 per bushel.  The soybean meal and soybean oil price ranges are unchanged at $295 to $335 per short ton and 32.5 to 36.5 cents per pound, respectively.The global oilseed supply and demand forecasts for 2017/18 include higher production, exports, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global production is forecast at 579.5 million tons, up 0.7 million mostly reflecting higher rapeseed, peanut, and palm kernel production.  Rapeseed is increased 0.8 million tons to 72.9 million as reductions for Australia and India are more than offset by a 1.6-million-ton increase for Canada based on recent government estimates.  Peanut production is raised for Senegal on higher area and yields.  An increase in EU sunflowerseed production is offset by lower production for Russia and Argentina.  Other production changes include higher palm oil for Indonesia and Thailand and lower palm oil for Malaysia.Global oilseed exports for 2017/18 are raised 0.5 million tons to 176.3 million with higher soybean exports for Argentina and Brazil and higher rapeseed exports for Canada.  Partly offsetting are lower soybean exports for the United States and Canada, and lower sunflowerseed exports for Argentina.  Global soybean stocks are up 0.4 million tons to 98.3 million, with lower stocks in South America offset by higher stocks in the United States, Canada, and the EU.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2017/18 is projected at 5.359 million short tons, raw value (STRV), up 409,256 from last month.  Recovery of sucrose from sliced sugarbeets for the first three months of the August/July crop year from Sweetener Market Data report provides the first empirically based estimate of full crop year recovery.  That recovery is projected at 15.4 percent in line with recent historical records.  Crop year beet sugar production that includes sugar from desugared molasses is projected at 5.530 million STRV.  The fiscal year October/September projection includes adjustments for August-September production that subtracts the estimate for 2017 and adds the historically based projection for 2018.  This also includes sugar produced from imported sugarbeets from Canada.  Sugar imports for 2017/18 are reduced by 384,452 STRV, as less sugar projected from Mexico is only partially offset by an increase in 2016/17 raw sugar tariff-rate quota imports entering after September 30.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 1.802 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.3 percent.The projection of Mexico sugar exports to the United States is based on the larger of the Target Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs from this WASDE report or the effective 2017/18 Export Limit previously calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC).  Mexico sugar exports to the United States are reduced by 364,595 metric tons (MT) to 1.085 million which is the Export Limit set by USDOC in September 2017 because it exceeds the Target Quantity of U.S. Needs from this WASDE.

Beef production is lowered on the current pace of cattle slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is lowered on smaller-than-anticipated hog slaughter this quarter although partly offset by higher carcass weights.  The broiler forecast is raised on a revision to third-quarter production data.  The turkey production forecast is unchanged from the previous month.  The egg production forecast is lowered on recent hatchery data.  For 2018, the total red meat and poultry forecast is lowered from last month on lower expected beef and pork production.  Beef production is forecast lower, reflecting slightly lighter carcass weights in 2018.  Pork production is reduced as fractionally heavier first-quarter carcass weights only partially offset smaller-than-expected hog slaughter.  USDA will release its Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on December 22 which will provide an indication of producers\u2019 farrowing intentions into the first half of 2018.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  The egg production forecast is raised for 2018.  The beef and turkey export forecasts are raised for 2017 on strong global demand which is expected to carry into first-quarter 2018.  No change is made to pork and broiler trade forecasts.  The egg export forecast is raised for 2017, supported by expectations of solid demand and recent trade data while the egg import forecast is reduced.  No change is made to the 2018 egg trade forecasts.   The cattle price forecast for 2017 is lowered on recent prices, but the 2018 cattle price forecast is unchanged from the previous month.  The hog price forecast for 2017 is raised on recent demand strength and as this strength is expected to carry into 2018, hog price forecasts are raised for next year.  The broiler price forecast is lowered for 2017, but the forecast is unchanged for 2018.  Turkey price forecasts are lowered for 2017 and 2018 on relatively weak demand.  Egg prices are raised for 2017 and 2018 on strength in demand.The milk production forecast is lowered for 2017 on slower growth in milk per cow.  The slower growth in milk per cow is expected to carry into 2018 and combined with an expected slower rate of growth in cow numbers, the 2018 milk production forecast is lowered.  The 2017 and 2018 fat basis import and export forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  On a skim-solids basis, the 2017 and 2018 export forecasts are raised on higher expected whey exports.  No changes are made to 2017 and 2018 skim-solids basis import forecasts. Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are lowered for 2017 on current price weakness and slower demand.  The 2017 whey price forecast is unchanged at the midpoint.  All dairy product price forecasts are reduced for 2018 on pressure from large stocks and slower expected demand.  Class III and Class IV price forecasts are lowered for 2017 and 2018, reflecting the lower product prices.  All milk prices are forecast lower at $17.60 to $17.70 per cwt for 2017and $16.65 to $17.45 per cwt for 2018.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. cotton forecasts include higher exports, slightly higher production, and lower ending stocks.  Production is raised 63,000 bales as increases in the Southwest are largely offset by decreases in other regions.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are raised 300,000 bales due to reduced production in other countries.  Ending stocks are now projected at 5.8 million bales, 200,000 lower than forecast in November, but more than double their 2016/17 level.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers is raised 3 cents at each end, to a midpoint of 66 cents.The global 2017/18 cotton forecasts include lower beginning stocks, production, and ending stocks.  Global production is reduced 1.5 million bales as reductions for Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Argentina, and Australia are only partly offset by increases in Turkey and Central Asia.  A 1.0-million-bale decline in India\u2019s estimated beginning stocks results in a similar decline in global 2017/18 beginning stocks.

Soybean supply and use projections for 2016/17 are unchanged from last month.  Although early-season soybean exports are sharply higher than a year ago, competition from South America is expected to be strong in the second half of the marketing year, limiting U.S. export prospects during the summer of 2017 relative to the prior year.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 480 million bushels which, if realized, would be the highest since 2006/07.  Soybean oil used for methyl ester is raised 250 million pounds to 6.2 billion for 2016/17 reflecting the recent EPA Renewable Fuel Standard announcements for 2017.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2016/17 is forecast at $8.70 to $10.20 per bushel, up 25 cents on both ends of the range.

Global soybean production is raised 1.9 million tons to 338.0 million on higher projected yields for India and Canada.  Peanut production is raised 0.7 million tons to 42.5 million mainly on increased production in India.  Sunflowerseed production is raised 0.6 million tons to 44.3 million on increased production in Russia and South Africa.Global oilseed trade for 2016/17 is projected at 159.9 million tons, up 0.1 million from last month.  Soybean exports account for most of the change with a higher projection for Canada partly offset by a reduction for Argentina.  Soybean imports are raised for the EU.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 94.6 million tons, up 1.7 million mainly on increased soybean stocks in Argentina and higher soybean and peanut stocks for India.

For 2016/17, Hawaii cane sugar production is raised by 6,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on close to end of season processor reporting.  Texas cane sugar production is raised by 5,000 STRV based on increased crop yield reported by NASS.  The projection of 2016/17 beet sugar production is unchanged as lower-than-expected sucrose levels in certain parts of the Red River Valley and Michigan are countered by strong content and record crop yields in western growing areas.  Imports of re-export sugar are raised by 50,000 STRV to 175,000 based on pace to date while imports from Mexico are reduced by 45,330 STRV to 972,246. Total use is unchanged.

Beef production is raised on the current pace of slaughter.  Pork production is lowered due to counter-seasonally lighter-than-expected carcass weights this quarter.  Broiler and turkey production is forecast lower, largely reflecting the slower pace of slaughter in the fourth quarter.  For 2017, pork and broiler production forecasts are unchanged from the previous month, but beef and turkey production forecasts are lowered.  USDA will release its Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on December 23 which will provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions into the first part of 2017.  Beef production is forecast lower, reflecting lower expectations for cattle placements in late 2016.  However, the ensuing decline in fed cattle slaughter will be slightly offset by higher expected cow slaughter.  The turkey production forecast is lowered from the previous month as a slower pace of slaughter is expected in the second half of the year.  Egg production is forecast higher for both 2016 and early 2017.The beef import forecast is raised for 2016 based on the recent pace of trade, but is unchanged for 2017.  Beef exports are raised for 2016, reflecting stronger export demand, but are unchanged for 2017.  Pork imports are lowered for 2016 and 2017 on recent trade data and the expected impact of forecast growth in production on import demand.  Forecast pork exports for 2017 are unchanged.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts are unchanged for 2016 and 2017.Cattle prices are forecast higher for the remainder of 2016 and through the first half of 2017 as demand has improved and is expected to carry into early 2017.  Hog prices are unchanged.  Broiler prices are raised for 2016 and 2017 on recent price strength.  Turkey prices are lowered in 2016 and 2017 on weaker-than-expected demand.  For 2016, egg prices are lowered reflecting current price data, but the price forecast for 2017 is unchanged.The milk production forecast is lowered for both 2016 and 2017 as slower growth in cow numbers more than offsets slightly higher growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis exports are raised for 2016 on higher butter exports, and skim-solids basis exports are increased on stronger sales of lactose.  For 2017, fat basis exports are reduced on expected increased competition in cheese markets, but strength in lactose and nonfat dry milk (NDM) exports are expected to support higher skim-solids basis exports.  Import forecasts are lowered from last month for both fat and skim-solids bases.  Fat basis ending stock forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised on higher expected cheese stocks.  Although the skim-solids basis ending stock forecast for 2016 is raised on higher-than-expected cheese and NDM stocks, the forecast for 2017 is unchanged as robust NDM exports are expected to draw down stocks during the year.Price forecasts for cheese and butter are raised for 2016 on current price strength, but the forecasts for NDM and whey prices are unchanged.  Product prices are forecast higher for 2017 as domestic demand strength is expected to carry into next year and higher export demand will support NDM and whey prices.  As a result of the higher cheese and butter price forecasts, Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised for 2016.  Class III and IV prices are forecast higher for 2017 on higher component product prices.  All milk prices are forecast higher at $16.05 to $16.15 per cwt for 2016 and $16.85 to $17.65 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. cotton forecasts include increased production, lower domestic mill use, and higher exports and ending stocks.  Production is raised 362,000 bales to 16.5 million due to an increase for Texas, which is partially offset by decreases for the Carolinas.  Domestic mill use is reduced 200,000 bales as recent activity indicates a slowdown in pace compared to the year-ago level.  The export projection is raised 200,000 bales on higher production.  Ending stocks are now projected at 4.8 million bales or 31 percent of disappearance.  The forecast range of 64 to 70 cents per pound for the marketing year average price received by producers is narrowed one cent on each end.The global 2016/17 forecasts likewise show higher production and increased ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is raised for Australia, the United States, and others. Consumption is reduced for India, the United States, and South Korea, and raised for China and Vietnam.  World trade is revised marginally.  World ending stocks are raised 842,000 bales to 89.1 million.",
    "August_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2021/22 include higher beginning stocks and lower production, crush, and exports.  Beginning soybean stocks are raised on lower 2020/21 crush and exports.  Soybean production for 2021/22 is forecast at 4.34 billion bushels, down 66 million on lower yields.  Harvested area is forecast at 86.7 million acres, unchanged from July.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 50.0 bushels per acre is reduced 0.8 bushels from last month.  Soybean supplies for 2020/21 are projected at 4.5 billion bushels, down 3 percent from last year.  Soybean crush is reduced 20 million bushels on a lower domestic soybean meal disappearance forecast which is reduced in line with the prior year, and lower soybean meal exports.  With soybean exports down 20 million bushels on lower supplies, ending stocks are forecast at 155 million bushels, unchanged from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2021/22 is forecast at $13.70 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $385 per short ton, down 10 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 65.0 cents per pound.The 2021/22 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, crush, exports, and slightly higher ending stocks compared to last month.  Foreign oilseed production is reduced 3.6 million tons to 501.4 million, reflecting lower canola production for Canada and sunflowerseed for Russia.  Partly offsetting is higher Ukrainian sunflowerseed.  Canada\u2019s canola crop is lowered 4.2 million tons to 16 million on drought in the Canadian Prairies.  Russian sunflowerseed production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 15.5 million as pockets of dryness and extreme heat in key regions lower overall crop prospects.  In contrast, Ukraine\u2019s sunflowerseed production is forecast higher as a wet spring followed by beneficial rains during June and July in southern Ukraine improved yield potential.Global 2021/22 oilseed crush is lowered mainly on lower soybean crush for China and lower rapeseed supplies leading to reduced crush for the EU, Canada, and China.  Soybean crush for China is lowered 2.0 million tons to 98 million, in line with downward revisions to crush and soybean meal consumption in the prior year.  With lower demand, China\u2019s 2021/22 soybean imports are lowered 1.0 million tons to 101 million.  Global oilseed stocks are slightly higher as lower production is paired with lower use.  Lower rapeseed and sunflowerseed stocks are offset by higher global soybean stocks, which are raised 1.7 million tons to 96.1 million mainly on higher stocks for China.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2020/21 is decreased by 51,945 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.063 million, mostly on a lower share of crop year 2021/22 beet sugar production occurring in August and September 2021.  That portion of processor-reported decreases (50,000 STRV) stemming from later-than-anticipated harvest start dates is expected to be accounted for in the 2021/22 fiscal year.  For 2021/22 NASS sugarbeet yield and area harvested forecasts in the August Crop Production report imply national sugarbeet production at 33.710 million tons, slightly above the total for 2020/21.  Assuming average recovery, shrink, and recovery from desugared molasses, 2021/22 crop year production is forecast at 4.988 million STRV.  Adjustments made for expected August-September production in 2021 and 2022 plus sugar from imported sugarbeets from Canada imply fiscal year 2021/22 production of 5.078 million STRV, an increase of 45,265 over last month.  Cane sugar production in Texas is decreased by 5,000 STRV based on processor reporting.Imports for 2020/21 are increased by 38,607 STRV to 3.177 million.  The raw sugar TRQ shortfall is reduced by 11,134 STRV to 75,721 after entry of sugar from the Philippines previously expected not to enter.  Re-export imports are increased by 45,000 STRV to 245,000 on the import pace from Customs and Border Protection ACE data.  Imports from Mexico that were part of the Other Sugar Export Limit increase made in April are decreased by 17,527 STRV due to inadequate supplies of below 99.2 pol sugar in Mexico.  There are no policy announcements concerning imports at this time.  Imports for 2021/22 are unchanged from last month.Exports for 2020/21 are increased by 10,000 STRV to 45,000 on the basis of increased pace.  There are no other changes to use for either 2020/21 or 2021/22.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are residually estimated at 1.753 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.28 percent.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 1.672 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.63 percent.  Mexico production for 2020/21 is estimated at 5.715 million metric tons (MT) with the finish of the campaign by all mills.  Deliveries to IMMEX are increased by 14,000 MT to 442,000 based on the pace to date. This estimate is carried over to 2021/22.  Ending stocks are adjusted slightly to cover anticipated use for the 2.5 months prior to next season production campaigns for both 2020/21 and 2021/22.  Exports are residually adjusted for small decreases of 9,469 MT in 2020/21 and 14,000 MT in 2021/22.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2021 is reduced from last month on lower expected beef and pork production.  The decline in beef production largely reflects lighter expected carcass weights due to a higher expected proportion of non-fed cattle being slaughtered through the end of the year.  The pork production forecast is reduced on a slower expected pace of slaughter for the remainder of the year and lighter carcass weights.  Broiler production is raised from last month as higher-than-expected second quarter production more than offset a lowered second half-forecast.  The turkey production forecast is virtually unchanged.  Egg production is lowered on recent data; the forecast for the second half of the year is unchanged. For 2022, the red meat and poultry production forecast is reduced as lower expected beef production more than offsets slightly higher pork production.  The beef production forecast is lowered on tighter expected supplies of both fed and non-fed cattle.  Pork production is forecast higher as slightly heavier carcass weights more than offset lower expected hog slaughter. Poultry and egg production forecasts are unchanged from last month. For 2021, beef imports are raised on recent trade data and expected firm demand from several key trading countries; the import forecasts for 2022 are also raised.  Beef export forecasts are lowered for both 2021 and 2022 on slowing global demand for U.S. beef.  Pork export forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced from last month on recent trade data and continued slower demand growth from Asia.  Broiler and egg export forecasts for 2021 are raised on recent data; no changes are made to the 2022 forecasts.   Cattle prices are raised for 2021 and 2022 on current price strength and firm demand.  The 2021 hog price forecast is raised on current price strength while the 2022 price forecast is unchanged from last month.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts for 2021 are raised on current prices; the 2022 forecasts are unchanged.Milk production forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced from last month on lower expected dairy cow numbers.  For 2021, the fat basis import forecast is raised from last month on firm demand for butterfat and cheese imports, while the fat basis export forecast is reduced.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2021 is raised primarily on higher imports of milk proteins while the export forecast is raised primarily on stronger expected sales of whey and lactose.  For 2022, the fat basis import forecast is raised on continued strong import demand for butter and butterfat, while the fat basis export forecast is raised as U.S. butter prices are expected to be competitive.  The skim-solids basis import and export forecasts are unchanged from last month.  For 2021, butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk, and whey price forecasts are lowered on relatively weak demand.  Dairy product prices are also reduced for 2022 reflecting continued relatively soft domestic demand and higher forecast beginning stocks.  The 2021 and 2022 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are reduced from the previous month on lower forecast dairy product prices.  The 2021 all milk price is forecast lower at $17.95 per cwt.  The all milk price forecast for 2022 is $17.85 per cwt. COTTON:  In this month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. cotton projections, beginning stocks are slightly larger, and a 536,000-bale decrease in production results in lower exports and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are larger as estimated exports for 2020/21 are reduced 50,000 bales based on final Export Sales data and Census Bureau data through June.  NASS\u2019s first survey-based estimate of production for 2021/22 is 17.3 million bales.  Exports are 200,000 bales lower than in July, and ending stocks are 300,000 bales lower, equating to 17 percent of expected use, the same as in 2020/21.  The U.S. season-average price for upland cotton is forecast 5 cents per pound higher than in July which, at 80 cents, would be its highest since 2011/12.Lower production is reducing this month\u2019s 2021/22 global ending stocks forecast slightly.  World production is forecast 546,000 bales lower as reduced production in Brazil, the United States, and Uzbekistan offsets higher projections for Australia, Mali, and Tanzania.  Consumption is forecast slightly higher, up 170,000 bales, with gains for Bangladesh and Pakistan.  World 2021/22 cotton ending stocks are projected at 87.2 million bales, about 500,000 bales lower than in July, and 4.6 million lower than in 2020/21.",
    "May_2022": "OILSEEDS:  The 2022/23 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and ending stocks compared with 2021/22.  The soybean crop is projected at 4.64 billion bushels, up 5 percent from last year\u2019s crop mainly on higher harvested area.  With slightly lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 4.89 billion bushels, up 4 percent from 2021/22.  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2022/23 is projected at 136.6 million tons, up 6.1 million from 2021/22 mainly on higher soybean production.  Production forecasts are also higher for canola and sunflowerseed.The U.S. soybean crush for 2022/23 is projected at 2.26 billion bushels, up 40 million from the 2021/22 forecast.  Domestic soybean meal disappearance is forecast to increase 2 percent from 2021/22 with low soybean meal prices relative to corn.  U.S. soybean meal exports are forecast at 14.4 million short tons, leaving the U.S share of global trade near the prior 5-year average.  With increased supplies, U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2.2 billion bushels, up 60 million from the revised 2021/22 projection.  Despite reduced soybean supplies available for export from South America for the first half of the 2022/23 marketing year, an anticipated record harvest and sharply higher exports beginning in early 2023 is expected to leave the U.S. with a lower share of global trade in 2022/23.  U.S. ending stocks for 2022/23 are projected at 310 million bushels, up 75 million from the revised 2021/22 forecast.The 2022/23 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $14.40 per bushel compared with $13.25 per bushel in 2021/22.  Soybean meal prices are forecast down $20 per short ton from 2021/22 to $400 per short ton and soybean oil prices are forecast down 5 cents to average 70 cents per pound, as oilseed and product supplies rebound in foreign markets. Global oilseed production for 2022/23 is projected at 647.1 million tons, rising 50.3 million from last marketing year when droughts impacted South American soybean production and the Canadian canola crop.  Global soybean production is forecast up 45.3 million tons to 394.7 million, with Brazil accounting for over half of the increase, up 24 million tons to a record 149 million.  Argentina\u2019s soybean crop is expected to reach 51 million tons and Paraguay 10 million.  Partly offsetting higher global soybean and canola production is lower oilseed production for Ukraine.  Global protein meal consumption is expected to grow 3 percent in 2022/23, recovering from slow growth in the past two marketing years.  Nearly half of the gains are in China where soybean crush is forecast to increase 6 million tons from 2021/22 to 95 million.  Exportable supplies of oilseed meals and oils are expected to recover, with higher 2022/23 crush for Canada and South America, which offset declines in sunflower products out of Ukraine.  Further, palm oil exports are expected to increase for Indonesia after slower-than-normal shipments and export restrictions in the prior marketing year.Global 2022/23 soybean exports are expected to increase 9 percent to 170.0 million tons after last year\u2019s drought-related declines in South America.  China accounts for about half of the trade growth, with 2022/23 imports rising 7 million tons to 99 million.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 99.6 million tons, up 14.4 million, with most of the increase in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States.  Other notable soybean changes include back year revisions to China\u2019s domestic consumption growth to better reflect per capita consumption and population growth.  Soybean imports for China in 2021/22 are raised 1 million tons to 92 million.  Global 2021/22 ending stocks are lowered with lower Chinese stocks, a reduction in Argentina\u2019s soybean production, and lower U.S. stocks.SUGAR:  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2022/23 is projected at 33.652 million tons with yield forecast at 30.23 tons/acre and area harvested projected at 1.113 million acres.  Assuming average regional levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production for the August-July crop year is projected at 4.922 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Sugar production from the 2022 crop in the August-September period is projected at 600,000 STRV, a drop of 78,461 from last month due to a very slow pace of plantings this year.  The net effect of August-September production projected for both 2022 and 2023 (5-year average of 678,461) is to increase fiscal year 2022/23 production over the crop year to 5.000 million STRV.  While beet sugar production for crop year 2021/22 is only marginally changed based on processors\u2019 data, the fiscal year 2021/22 total is reduced to 5.254 million due to the lower anticipated production in 2022 August and September.  Cane sugar production for 2022/23 is projected at 4.040 million STRV.  Production levels in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas are expected to be close to 2021/22 levels.  For 2021/22, Florida cane production is increased by 4,358 STRV to 1.942 million on processors\u2019 reporting.  TRQ imports for 2022/23 are projected at 1.379 million STRV with levels set at minimum levels consistent with the WTO and FTA bindings and with TRQ shortfall projected at 99,208.  Re-export imports are projected at 250,000 STRV and high-tier tariff imports at 50,000 STRV.  Imports from Mexico for 2022/23 are projected at 1.323 million STRV.  For 2021/22, TRQ imports are up 159,625 STRV to 1.727 million on the reallocation of the TRQ shortfall.  Shortfall for 2021/22 is now estimated at 70,548 STRV.  Re-export imports are increased 50,000 STRV to 300,000 on pace to date.  Imports from Mexico are up by 170,000 STRV to reflect the recent increase in the \u201cOther Sugar\u201d Export Limit made by the Department of Commerce at the request of USDA.  High-tier tariff imports for 2021/22 are increased by 31,833 STRV on recent imports of raw sugar paying the high duty.Deliveries for 2021/22 are increased by 85,000 STRV to 12.450 million on a very strong pace for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, especially by beet processors and direct importers of refined sugar.  Deliveries for 2022/23 are at the same levels as estimated for 2021/22.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are estimated at 1.813 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.40 percent, up from 12.53 percent last month.  Ending stocks for 2022/23 are residually projected at 1.266 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 10.05 percent.Mexico production for 2022/23 is projected at 6.000 million metric tons (MT).  Area harvested is projected at 795,000 hectares, yield at 67.76 MT/hectare, and recovery at 11.14 percent.  Production of less-than-99.2 pol raw sugar, or \u201cOther Sugar\u201d as defined in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements, is projected at 792,868 MT.  This production level corresponds to the 13.2-percent 5-year average of low pol sugar as a proportion of total sugar production.  This sugar is for shipment to the U.S. market and is projected to constitute 70 percent of total exports to the United States, or 1.133 million MT.  Deliveries, imports, and ending stocks are expected to be close to 2021/22 levels.  Exports are residually projected at 1.628 million MT, with 495,804 going to destinations other than the United States under license.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2023 is forecast below 2022, as lower beef production more than offsets higher pork and poultry production.  For 2023, beef production is forecast lower with expected declines in both fed and non-fed cattle supplies.  Pork production is forecast higher with increased farrowings and continued growth in productivity.  Higher forecast broiler production reflects moderating feed costs and improved productivity.  Turkey production is projected higher as the sector recovers from the 2022 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks.  Egg production is likewise forecast higher with post-HPAI flock rebuilding.Total red meat and poultry production forecasts for 2022 are raised from last month. Higher beef and broiler production more than offset a reduction in pork and turkey production.  Beef production is raised, with more cattle placed in feedlots sooner than normally expected due to drought conditions, supporting higher annual fed cattle slaughter.  Additionally, cow slaughter is forecast higher. Pork production is reduced on lighter expected carcass weights. Based on recent slaughter and hatchery data, the broiler production forecast is raised while the turkey production forecast is lowered. Egg production is lowered on reduced expected laying flocks. For 2023, beef exports are down from 2022 on lower beef production and higher prices. Beef imports are lower on tight global supplies. Pork imports are slightly higher compared to 2022 and exports are slightly lower. Broiler exports are forecast higher on increased production and lower prices, and turkey exports are forecast slightly higher on increased supplies and a resumption of pre-HPAI trade patterns.For 2022, beef and broiler exports are raised while pork and turkey exports are lowered based on recent trade data. For 2023, cattle prices are forecast above 2022 on tighter supplies.  Hog, broiler, and turkey prices are forecast lower with increased production.  The egg price is forecast lower with higher expected production. The 2022 cattle price forecast is raised on recent data and tighter expected fed cattle supplies later in the year.  Hog prices are lowered on prices to date and weaker demand, while broiler and turkey prices are raised on stronger prices to date and continued demand strength.Milk production for 2023 is forecast above 2022 driven by gains in milk per cow, with the milk cow herd expected to average close to 2022 levels.  Exports on a fat basis are forecast lower, largely on lower expected butter sales.  On a skim-solids basis, exports are forecast higher with gains expected in cheese, skim milk powder, and whey sales.  Imports are projected to grow on a skim-solids basis with higher imports of a number of dairy products, but are unchanged on a fat basis. The Class III price is forecast lower on weaker cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is forecast lower as well, with projections lower than 2022 for butter and non-fat dry milk.  The 2023 all milk price is forecast at $23.55 per cwt.The 2022 milk production forecast is raised from the previous month, with higher milk cow inventories more than offsetting slower growth in milk per cow. Fat-basis exports are raised from the previous month mainly on stronger butter and cheese shipments. The skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered on weaker skim milk powder and whey exports. Fat basis and skim-solids basis import forecasts are raised from last month on higher expected imports of a number of dairy-containing products.  Cheese and butter prices are raised from the previous month on strong demand, but non-fat dry milk and whey prices are lowered.  The Class III price is unchanged and Class IV is lowered. The 2022 all milk price is forecast at $25.75.COTTON:  Despite an expected 1-million-acre year-to-year increase in U.S. area planted to cotton, the U.S. cotton projections for 2022/23 include a smaller crop as abandonment is projected to more than double.  Production is forecast at 16.5 million bales, based on 12.2 million planted acres as indicated in the March Prospective Plantings, but harvested area is expected to fall 1.1 million acres to 9.1 million as limited precipitation in the Southwest suggests more abandonment compared with 2021/22\u2019s below-average level.  With a higher national yield, production is forecast about 1 million bales lower.  With a larger carryin, supplies are projected slightly lower.  Exports are also expected to fall slightly, to 14.5 million bales, as the U.S. share of world trade declines.  At 2.9 million bales, 2022/23 U.S. ending stocks are projected 500,000 bales lower than the year before, and equivalent to 17 percent of total use.  The marketing year average upland farm price is projected at 90 cents per pound, down slightly from the previous year\u2019s record high.For 2021/22, U.S. cotton production is reduced about 100,000 bales from last month to 17.5 million bales.  Exports and consumption are unchanged, and ending stocks are estimated 100,000 bales lower, at 3.4 million.  The projected season-average price is 1 cent higher than in April, at 92 cents per pound.Global supplies in 2022/23 are projected below a year earlier, as lower beginning stocks more than offset a 2.6-million-bale increase in production, with consumption and ending stocks also lower.  Increased area is expected to drive production higher, with a 2-million-bale increase expected in India\u2019s crop, 500,000-bale gains expected in China and Turkey, and smaller increases forecast for Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Mexico.  World consumption in 2022/23 is projected to fall 1 million bales from the year before to 122 million bales, with cotton prices currently the highest since 2011 and the highest ever relative to polyester.  World ending stocks are expected to fall 1 percent from the year before, to 82.8 million bales.  World trade is expected to rise 2 million bales as China\u2019s imports partly rebound.The global 2021/22 estimates show lower production and use compared with the previous month.  India\u2019s crop is reduced 1 million bales as late-season marketings fell, accounting for much of the 1.8-million-bale global decrease.  Projected world consumption is down 1.1 million bales from April as China\u2019s forecast is reduced 500,000 bales and historical revisions to Uzbekistan\u2019s balance sheet reduced estimated consumption there 500,000 bales.  Ending stocks are slightly lower as well, down 270,000 bales to 83.6 million. ",
    "April_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2017/18 include increased crush, lower seed and residual use, and lower ending stocks.  Soybean crush is projected at a record 1,970 million bushels, up 10 million reflecting higher soybean meal prices which are supporting crush margins.  Seed use is reduced in line with the plantings indicated in the March 29 Prospective Plantings report.  With exports unchanged, soybean ending stocks are projected at 550 million bushels, down 5 million.  Soybean oil changes include increased production, exports, and ending stocks.  Soybean oil used for biodiesel is reduced this month reflecting lower-than-expected use through the first four months of the marketing year.The season-average soybean price is forecast at $9.10 to $9.50, unchanged at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price is projected at 30.5 to 32.5 cents per pound, also unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $340 to $360 per short ton, up $10.00 at the midpoint.The 2017/18 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, exports, crush, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is lowered 5.7 million tons to 568.8 million, with a 6.1-million-ton reduction for soybean production and slightly higher projections for rapeseed, sunflowerseed, copra, and palm kernel.  Lower soybean production for Argentina, India, and Uruguay is partly offset by higher production for Brazil.  Soybean production for Brazil is forecast at a record 115.0 million tons, up 2.0 million on higher projected yields for Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Parana due to beneficial rainfall during the growing season.  For Argentina, production is lowered 7.0 million tons to 40.0 million on reduced harvested area and yield, reflecting dry conditions during January through March.  With reduced production, soybean crush for Argentina is lowered 1.8 million tons to 41.2 million, resulting in lower soybean meal and oil supplies traded globally.  Other oilseed production changes include reduced sunflower and peanut production for Argentina, higher sunflowerseed production for the European Union, and increased rapeseed production for Belarus.Global oilseed trade for 2017/18 is projected at 174.1 million tons, down 0.6 million on lower soybean, peanut, and rapeseed shipments.  Soybean exports are reduced 0.2 million tons as higher exports for Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine are offset by lower exports for Argentina and Uruguay.  Peanut and rapeseed exports are lowered for Senegal and the European Union, respectively.  Global soybean ending stocks are lowered 3.6 million tons to 90.8 million with reductions mainly for Argentina, Brazil, and the EU.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production is decreased 80,000 short tons raw value (STRV), to 5.139 million based on reduced sucrose recovery.  Florida cane sugar production is reduced by 19,287 STRV to 1.973 million based on the latest processor reports.  High-tier tariff imports for 2017/18 are increased by 5,000 STRV to 15,000 based on pace to date.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are residually projected at 1.859 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.7 percent, down from last month\u2019s 15.5 percent.  The Mexico sugar supply and use balance is unchanged from last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2018 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as forecasts for all major meats are reduced.  The beef production forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower first-half slaughter and lighter weights, but this decline is partly offset by higher expected third-quarter slaughter.  Pork production is raised for the first quarter based on estimated production data, but lowered for outlying quarters on a slower pace of slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  The USDA Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report of March 29, estimated producers farrowed 2 percent more sows during December to February and indicated intentions to farrow about 2 percent more sows in March to May.  These hogs will be ready for slaughter in the second half of 2018.  Broiler and turkey production is reduced on recent hatchery data.  First-quarter egg production is reduced on recent production data but no change is made to the outlying quarters.  For 2018, beef imports and exports are unchanged from last month.  The pork import forecast is unchanged.  Pork exports are reduced on weaker expected exports to China although exports to other markets are expected to increase.  No change is made to broiler or turkey exports.  Cattle and hog price forecasts are reduced from last month as demand for cattle and hogs has softened and supplies are expected to be large in the coming quarters.  The broiler price forecast is raised from last month as stronger demand in the first quarter is expected to carry into subsequent quarters.  Turkey prices are reduced through the year on the continued slow recovery in demand.  Egg price forecasts are raised on robust demand. The milk production forecast for 2018 is unchanged from last month.  The 2018 import forecast is reduced slightly on a fat basis, but is unchanged on a skim-solids basis.  Exports on fat basis are unchanged from last month, but skim-solids-basis exports are raised on stronger sales of nonfat dry milk and skim milk powder, and lactose.The annual product price forecast for cheese is unchanged at the midpoint although the range is narrowed.  Butter prices are expected to increase more slowly in the second half of the year and the price forecast is reduced.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is reduced slightly on current prices.  The annual whey price forecast is lowered on larger supplies and weaker demand.  The Class III price is lowered on the lower whey price forecast while the Class IV price is down on lower NDM and butter price forecasts.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $15.60 to $16.10 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2017/18 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged. The export forecast is raised 200,000 bales, to 15.0 million, based on the pace of recent sales and shipments.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 5.3 million bales, equivalent to 29 percent of total disappearance.  The marketing year price received by producers is projected to average 68 cents per pound, a reduction of 1 cent from last month. Lower global beginning stocks this month result in lower projected 2017/18 ending stocks despite higher world production and lower consumption.  World beginning stocks are 900,000 bales lower this month, largely attributable to historical revisions for Brazil and Australia.  World production is about 250,000 bales higher as a larger Brazilian crop more than offsets a decline for Sudan.  Consumption is about 400,000 bales lower as lower consumption in India, Indonesia, and some smaller countries more than offsets Vietnam\u2019s increase.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are nearly 600,000 bales lower in total this month as reductions for Brazil, Sudan, the United States, and Australia more than offset an increase for Pakistan.",
    "October_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2018/19 is projected at 138.4 million tons, down 0.1 million from last month with lower soybean and sunflowerseed production only partly offset with higher canola production.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,690 million bushels, down 3.5 million with higher yields offset by lower harvested area.  The soybean yield is projected at 53.1 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels from the September forecast.  Harvested area is reduced 0.6 million acres to 88.3 million.  Increases for North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa are more than offset by reductions in many other states.  Soybean supplies for 2018/19 are projected at a record 5,153 million bushels on higher beginning stocks.  With soybean use unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 885 million bushels.The 2018/19 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $7.35 to $9.85, unchanged at the midpoint from last month.  Soybean meal and soybean oil price projections are also unchanged at $290 to $330 per short ton and 28.0 to 32.0 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2018/19 is projected at 603.9 million tons, down 0.7 million from last month as lower peanut production is partly offset by higher soybean and rapeseed production.  Global soybean output is projected at a record 369.5 million tons, up 0.2 million with higher production for Canada partly offset by lower projections for India, the United States, and Mexico.  The soybean and peanut crops for India are reduced on lower area harvested based on government reports.  India\u2019s peanut yield is also reduced due to below-normal and inconsistent rainfall in Gujarat where nearly half of the peanuts are produced.  Despite lower global oilseed production, increased beginning stocks, mainly in the United States, results in a 2.0 million-ton increase to global oilseed ending stocks to 123.8 million.  Global soybean ending stocks are increased 1.8 million tons to 110.0 million.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2017/18 is decreased by 58,022 short tons, raw value (STRV).  The decrease reflects a reduction in estimated Louisiana cane sugar production for the month of September 2018 and a net reduction in imports.  Imports under tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) are reduced by 62,527 STRV but are partially offset by a 10,000-STRV increase in high-tier tariff imports and a 1,404-STRV increase in re-export imports.  U.S. sugar supply for 2018/19 is reduced by 99,496 STRV.  The reduction reflects lower beginning stocks and lower production partially offset by a shift in free trade agreement 2018 calendar year TRQ imports from the third quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter.  Beet sugar production for 2018/19 is reduced 106,719 STRV on a lower sugarbeet production forecast by NASS.  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 40,724 STRV on NASS increases for both sugarcane area and yield forecasts.Mexico sugar exports for 2017/18 are estimated at 1.147 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 60,116 from last month.  Exports are comprised of 1.086 million MT to the United States under export licenses and of combined exports of 60,796 MT to non-U.S. destinations and to the U.S. re-export import program.  Ending stocks are residually estimated at 1.328 million MT of which 350,358 are required to be exported in 2018/19 before December 31 per provisions administered by the Fideicomiso Maestro para la Exportaci\u00f3n de Excedentes de los Ingenios (FIMAE).  Mexico sugar exports for 2018/19 are projected to increase 86,207 MT reflecting supplies reported by CONADESUCA under FIMAE provisions.   LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2018 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month largely due to lower expected fourth-quarter fed cattle slaughter.  Carcass weights are forecast lower on a higher expected proportion of cows in the slaughter mix.  The pork production forecast is lowered on smaller second-half commercial hog slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  The broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced on expectations of slightly lower slaughter for the remainder of the year.  The 2018 egg production forecast is raised from last month. For 2019, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is raised from the previous month as higher expected beef production more than offsets lowered forecasts for pork and broiler production.  Beef production is raised from last month as larger placements in late 2018 and early 2019 are marketed during 2019.  However, carcass weights are lowered for the early part of the year.  Pork production is forecast slightly lower from last month.  Both hog slaughter and carcass weight forecasts are reduced.  The 2019 broiler production forecast is reduced from last month while the turkey production forecast is unchanged. Beef import forecasts are lowered for 2018 and 2019 while beef export forecasts remain unchanged.  Pork import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced from last month.  No change is made to the 2018 pork export forecast, but the 2019 export forecast is raised on strong global demand for competitively priced U.S. pork products.  The 2018 and 2019 turkey export forecasts are reduced from last month on recent trade data and slower expected demand into next year.  Annual broiler and egg export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged from last month.      The 2018 cattle price for the fourth quarter is raised from last month, but no change is made to the 2019 price forecast.  The hog price forecast is raised for the last quarter of 2018 and into 2019 on expected demand strength.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are unchanged at the midpoint for 2018 and 2019.  The egg price forecast for fourth-quarter 2018 is raised on near-term demand strength, but no change is made to the 2019 price forecasts.The milk production forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised from the previous month on a more rapid pace of growth in milk per cow.  Cow numbers are raised for 2019.  Fat basis imports for 2018 and 2019 are raised on continued strength in butterfat imports and slightly higher cheese imports.  The 2018 and 2019 skim-solids basis import forecasts are lowered from the previous month.  Exports on a fat basis are raised for 2018 on stronger cheese exports, but no change is made to the 2019 export forecast.  Skim-solids basis exports for 2018 are raised, primarily on stronger nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey product shipments.    For 2018 and 2019, butter and whey price forecasts are raised from the previous month on expected demand strength, but the cheese price forecasts are lowered on continued large supplies.  The NDM price forecast is unchanged.  The Class III price is lowered for 2018; but for 2019, higher whey prices are expected to more than offset the declines in cheese prices, and the Class III price forecast is raised.  The Class IV price is raised for both years due to higher forecast butter prices.  The 2018 all milk price forecast is unchanged at the midpoint at $16.35 to $16.45 per cwt, and the 2019 price is raised to $16.85 to $17.75 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2018/19 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show higher ending stocks, based on slightly larger production and lower exports relative to last month.  Production is raised 81,000 bales, with higher production in Texas and Georgia largely offset by lower production in the Carolinas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is reduced 200,000 bales to 15.5 million, due to reduced world trade and consumption.  Ending stocks are forecast at 5.0 million bales, and the resulting stocks-to-use ratio of 26 percent is slightly higher than the previous month\u2019s forecast, and the highest since 2015/16.  The forecast range for the marketing year average farm price is 69.0 to 77.0 cents per pound; the midpoint of 73.0 cents is down 2 cents from the previous month\u2019s projection.The 2018/19 global ending stocks forecast is lowered 4 percent this month as lower production and sharply lower beginning stocks offset marginally smaller consumption.  Stocks are lowered mainly in India, as revisions are made to production, consumption, and loss over 2002/03-2013/14 to better reflect Indian government data (consumption) and the impact of shifting producers\u2019 marketing patterns (see the October 2018 issue of the FAS Cotton: World Markets and Trade publication).  Production forecasts are lowered for Australia, and raised for Greece and the United States.  Consumption and imports are lowered for Turkey.  Global beginning stocks are lowered 2.9 million bales and ending stocks are lowered 3.0 million bales.  Ending stocks in 2018/19 are down 6.4 million bales from last year, largely reflecting an expected 8.2-million-bale decline in China. ",
    "May_2020": "OILSEEDS:  The 2020/21 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and lower ending stocks compared to 2019/20.  The soybean crop is projected at 4.125 billion bushels, up 568 million from last year on increased harvested area and trend yields.  Despite lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected up 5 percent from 2019/20 to 4.720 billion bushels.  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2020/21 is forecast at 123.2 million tons, up 16.1 million from 2019/20 mainly on higher soybean production.  Production forecasts are also higher for sunflowerseed, peanuts, and cottonseed.  Canola production is forecast lower on a reduced yield.  The U.S. soybean crush for 2020/21 is projected at 2.130 billion bushels, up slightly from the 2019/20 forecast with higher soybean meal disappearance partly offset by lower soybean meal exports.  U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2.050 billion bushels, up 375 million from the revised forecast for 2019/20.  With higher global soybean import demand for 2020/21 led by expected gains for China, U.S. export share is expected to rise to 34 percent from the 2019/20 record low of 30 percent.  U.S. ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 405 million bushels, down 175 million from the revised 2019/20 forecast.  The 2020/21 U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $8.20 per bushel, down 30 cents from 2019/20.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $290 per short ton, down $10.00 from 2019/20.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.0 cents per pound, up 0.5 cents from 2019/20.The global oilseed outlook for 2020/21 includes larger supplies with lower beginning stocks offset by record production; however, ending stocks are expected to decline modestly with rising use.  Global oilseed production for 2020/21 is projected at a record 605.9 million tons, up 30.7 million from 2019/20 mainly on higher soybean production.  Global soybean production is forecast up 26.6 million tons to 362.8 million, with Brazil\u2019s crop rising 7.0 million tons to 131.0 million, Argentina\u2019s crop is up 2.5 million tons to 53.5 million, and U.S. production rising from last year\u2019s decline.  Partly offsetting are smaller soybean crops projected for China and Ukraine.  Global production of high-oil content seeds is projected up 3 percent from 2019/20 on increased canola production for Canada, Australia, and Ukraine, and higher sunflowerseed production for Argentina and Ukraine.  Partly offsetting is lower sunflowerseed production for Turkey.Global protein meal consumption outside of China is projected to increase 2 percent in 2020/21, down from the prior 5-year average of 3 percent due to the slowing global economy.  Protein meal consumption in China at 6 percent is stronger than the prior few years, however, as China recovers from the August 2018 outbreak of African Swine Fever.  With higher protein meal demand, soybean exports are expected to increase 8.0 million tons to 161.9 million.  China accounts for most of the increase in shipments with imports rising 4 million tons to 96 million.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 98.4 million tons, down 1.9 million from 2019/20.  Lower year-over-year U.S. stocks offset higher stocks in China, Brazil, and Argentina.  SUGAR:  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2020/21 is projected at 33.672 million tons with yield forecast at 30.11 tons/acre.  Slower-than-average planting progress in the Upper Midwest has dampened prospects for significant gains in the national yield over last year.  Assuming average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.965 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is estimated to fall slightly from last month due to processors\u2019 reporting.  Cane sugar production for 2020/21 is projected at 4.040 million STRV.  Production in Florida and Texas are expected to be close to prior year levels.  Louisiana production is projected higher at 1.800 million STRV on a return to trend yield and recovery. Imports for 2020/21 are projected at 3.461 million STRV.  TRQ imports are projected at 1.395 million STRV with levels set at minimum levels consistent with the WTO and FTA bindings.  Projected 2020/21 TRQ imports of specialty sugar include only the WTO minimum quantity as additional quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture.  The WTO raw sugar TRQ shortfall for 2020/21 is projected at 99,208 STRV.  High-tier tariff imports for 2020/21 are projected at 50,000 STRV.  Imports from Mexico for 2020/21 are projected at 1.660 million STRV.  Imports from Mexico for 2019/20 are reduced by 148,840 STRV to 1.050 million on lower production in Mexico.  Deliveries to domestic users for 2020/21 are projected at 12.320 million STRV, flat with levels estimated for 2019/20.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are residually projected at 1.468 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 11.97 percent, up from 10.38 percent in 2019/20.Mexico production for 2020/21 is set at 6.100 million metric tons (MT), assuming a return to normal weather and area harvested projected at about the same level as this year.  Production for 2019/20 is reduced by 110,000 MT to 5.125 million, mainly on reduced area for harvest and below-average yields and sucrose recovery.  Deliveries of high fructose corn syrup for 2020/21 are projected at 1.493 million MT, the same level as now estimated for 2019/20.  Per capita sweetener deliveries for 2020/21 for human consumption are projected at the same level as in 2019/20, implying sugar deliveries at 4.140 million MT.  IMMEX deliveries for 2020/21 from domestic and imported sources are projected at 435,000 MT, the same as estimated for 2019/20.  Ending stocks for both 2020/21 and 2019/20 are set equal to 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar deliveries before the start of the succeeding sugarcane harvest.  Total exports are residually projected but exports to the United States are projected at the expected level of U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2021 is projected to be above 2020 as the sector continues to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 in 2020.  Beef production is forecast higher as cattle placements in 2020 are expected to shift toward the latter part of the year and be marketed and slaughtered in 2021.  Heavier carcass weights are also expected to support higher production.  Pork production is expected to increase as the sector recovers from the slaughter adjustments of 2020.  Broiler production is expected to surpass 2020 levels on expectations of improved returns.  Turkey and egg production are forecast higher as producers respond to favorable prices in 2020.  For 2020, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is reduced from last month as the sector adjusts to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty.  Beef production is reduced as lower expected cattle slaughter more than offsets heavier carcass weights.  Pork production is forecast lower on a slower expected pace of slaughter.  However, heavier hog carcass weights are expected to partially offset lower production.  Broiler and turkey production are lowered from last month as producers respond to weaker demand and adjustments to the pace of slaughter due to COVID-19.  Egg production for 2020 is also reduced from last month.  Red meat and poultry exports are expected to increase in 2021 on expanding production and an expected increase in global demand.  For 2020, export forecasts for beef and pork are reduced on slower expected export growth due to economic weakness and reduced supplies.  Broiler exports are raised on current trade data and firm demand; the turkey export forecast is virtually unchanged. For 2021, fed cattle, hog, and broiler prices are forecast higher on stronger expected demand, despite larger production.  The 2021 turkey price forecast is fractionally below 2020.  Egg prices in 2021 are forecast lower on supply pressure.  For 2020, fed cattle prices are forecast lower on current prices and weak demand.  Hog prices are raised from last month on current prices and improved demand expectations as the year progresses.  Broiler prices are forecast lower on current prices, while turkey and egg price forecasts are raised.  Milk production for 2021 is forecast higher than 2020 on stronger expected growth in milk per cow, despite a slightly smaller dairy cow herd.  Commercial exports on a fat basis are about the same as 2020 while skim-solids basis exports are forecast higher than 2020 on relatively firm demand.  Imports on both a fat basis and skim-solid basis are forecast above 2020.  With improved domestic and export demand, all dairy products prices are forecast higher in 2021.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are forecast higher on stronger product prices.  The 2021 all milk price is forecast higher at $15.00 per cwt. The 2020 milk production forecast is raised from the previous month primarily on higher-than-expected cow numbers.  The fat basis export forecast is raised from the previous month on recent trade data and stronger expected global demand.  The fat basis import forecast is also raised from last month on stronger expected imports of cheese.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecast for 2020 is raised on stronger global import demand for skim milk powder, whey products, and a number of dairy products, while the import forecast is raised on increased imports of cheese and milk protein products.  Cheese and whey prices are raised from the previous month resulting in a higher Class III price forecast.  Butter and NDM prices are lowered from last month, resulting in a lower Class IV price forecast.  The 2020 all milk price is forecast at $14.55 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton forecasts for 2020/21 include larger beginning stocks, consumption, exports, and ending stocks compared with the year before.  Production is forecast at 19.5 million bales\u2014400,000 bales less than the year before, based on 13.7 million planted acres as indicated in the NASS March Prospective Plantings report.  Planted area is expected to be virtually unchanged from 2019/20, but harvested area is projected 2 percent lower, as abandonment rises from 2019/20.  The yield is projected only slightly higher, using 10-year regional averages.  Domestic mill use and exports are expected to rebound as the world economy begins to recover.  Mill use is expected to rise 200,000 bales, and exports by 1 million; but ending stocks are expected to rise 600,000 bales to 7.7 million, equivalent to 41 percent of use.  This would be marginally higher than in 2019/20 and the highest since 2007/08\u2019s 55 percent.  The price received by upland producers is forecast at 57 cents per pound, slightly below 2019/20.For 2019/20, U.S. cotton production is raised slightly from last month.  The export forecast is unchanged, but expected consumption is 200,000 bales lower, and ending stocks 400,000 bales higher.World ending stocks in 2020/21 are projected to rise for a second consecutive year, but at a much slower pace.  With harvested area down globally, production is expected to decline 3.7 million bales, while consumption is expected to rise 11.5 million bales as the global economy begins recovering.  Global ending stocks are expected to rise 2.3 million bales, but fall as a share of consumption, from 93 percent in 2019/20 to 85 percent.For 2019/20, the world consumption forecast is reduced to 105.0 million bales, down 5.6 million from the previous forecast and 12.7 percent below the previous year.  This would be the largest annual decline in world consumption since the 19th century.  World production is raised 1 million bales from the previous month, and 2019/20 ending stocks are 5.9 million higher.  The revised year-to-year increase in global ending stocks is 16.9 million bales.",
    "February_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected at 125 million bushels, down 10 million from last month due to increased crush.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1.615 billion reflecting both larger soybean meal exports and domestic use.  Strong U.S. soybean meal exports during the first half of the marketing year are partly offsetting declining shipments from Argentina where crushing has slowed due to limited soybean supplies.  Domestic soybean meal use is raised in line with projected gains in meat production. Soybean oil production is raised on higher soybean crush and a higher soybean oil extraction rate.  Soybean oil exports are projected at 2.3 billion pounds, up 150 million from last month as sales continue stronger than expected.  Soybean oil used for methyl ester is unchanged this month despite relatively low use during the first quarter of the marketing year.  Production and use are expected to expand in coming months due to the higher mandate for 2013.  Soybean oil stocks are projected at 1.665 billion pounds, up 125 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2012/13 is projected at $13.55 to $15.05 per bushel, up 5 cents on both ends of the range.  The soybean meal price is projected at $430 to $460 per short ton, unchanged from last month.  The soybean oil price projection is also unchanged at 49 to 53 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2012/13 is projected at 466.9 million tons, up 1.1 million from last month.  Global soybean production is raised fractionally to 269.5 million tons as improved production prospects in Brazil offset deteriorating conditions in Argentina.  Soybean production for Brazil is projected at a record 83.5 million tons, up 1 million from last month due to higher yields resulting from improved moisture in the center-west.  Prospects for the Argentina soybean crop have diminished in recent weeks due to an extended period of dry weather.  As a result, the crop is projected at 53 million tons, down 1 million from last month.  Global sunflowerseed production is projected at 36.4 million tons, up 0.5 million due to gains for Russia and Kazakhstan.  Other changes include increased peanut and cottonseed production for China, and reduced cottonseed production for Pakistan, Mexico, and Turkey.Global oilseed and product supply and use changes this month include reduced soybean crush and soybean meal exports for Argentina, reduced soybean meal imports for EU-27, increased rapeseed crush and rapeseed meal consumption for EU-27, and increased sunflowerseed crush in Russia.  Global oilseed stocks are projected higher, mostly reflecting higher soybean stocks in Brazil.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2012/13 is increased 65,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, due to higher sugar production more than offsetting lower imports. Louisiana cane sugar and U.S. beet sugar production estimates are increased in line with reports from processors, and increased shortfall in filling the tariff rate quota accounts for reduced imports.  Sugar use is unchanged.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2013 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month reflecting higher forecast beef, pork, broiler, and turkey production.  Beef production is raised based mostly on heavier carcass weights.  The beef production forecast is also raised as cow slaughter in the first quarter is expected to be relatively high.  Pork production is raised as carcass weights are expected to reflect more moderate feed costs.  Broiler hatchery data pointed to continued expansion of bird numbers and weights at slaughter have been increasing.  Thus, the broiler production forecast is raised from last month.  Turkey production is raised slightly on hatchery data.  Egg production is raised on higher producer prices and lower forecast feed prices.  Estimates of 2012 meat and egg production are adjusted to reflect December data. The beef export forecast for 2013 is unchanged as trade restrictions by Russia are offset by gains to Japan and other markets.  Pork exports are lowered on trade restrictions imposed by Russia although there is expected to be some offset in higher exports to other markets.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts are raised from last month on stronger demand from a number of markets.  Import forecasts are unchanged from January.  Beef and pork export estimates for 2012 are lowered due to slower-than-expected shipments in November.  Poultry is raised based on larger-than-expected November shipments.Cattle, hog, and turkey prices for 2013 are unchanged from last month.  Broiler and egg prices are raised on expected demand strength in 2013. The milk production forecast for 2013 is raised.  Milk cow numbers are raised as USDA\u2019s Cattle report indicated that the number of cows on January 1 was about unchanged from 2012.  Milk per cow forecasts are raised as last quarter-2012 estimates were higher than expected and lower forecast feed costs support higher milk yields in 2013.  Fat-basis trade estimates for 2013 are unchanged.  The skim-solids export estimate for 2013 is raised largely on expectations of stronger nonfat dry milk (NDM) shipments, but the import forecast is unchanged.  Milk production estimates for 2012 are raised, reflecting end-of-year production data.  Dairy trade estimates for 2012 reflect the pace of trade through November. \u00a0Cheese prices are unchanged from last month, but the price range is narrowed.  NDM and whey prices are raised reflecting stronger demand, but the butter price is lowered.  Despite a higher whey price, the forecast Class III price is unchanged although the range is tightened.  Lower butter prices are more than offset by higher NDM prices resulting in a slightly higher forecast Class IV price.  The range of all milk price for 2013 is narrowed to $18.90 to $19.70 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2012/13 U.S. cotton forecasts include higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Estimates of production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  Exports are raised slightly to 12.5 million bales, due mainly to an increase in projected imports by China.  Ending stocks are forecast at 4.5 million bales, accounting for 28 percent of total disappearance.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 69-73 cents per pound is raised 3 cents on the lower end and 2 cents on the upper end of the range, reflecting a sharp increase in the price received for December.The aggregate world 2012/13 production, consumption, and stocks forecasts show only slight revisions this month, but increases in China\u2019s production and imports are raising the expected concentration of stocks there.  World production is estimated marginally higher, as increases for China and Kazakhstan are mostly offset by decreases for Pakistan and Turkey.  World consumption likewise is increased marginally, reflecting increases for Turkey and others.  China\u2019s imports are raised 1.5 million bales to 14.0 million, increasing world trade by a like amount, based on heavy imports during the first half of the marketing year.  Exports are raised for the United States, Australia, Brazil, Uzbekistan, the African Franc Zone, Greece, and others.  World ending stocks are virtually unchanged at 81.9 million bales, but China\u2019s stocks are raised 2.0 million bales to 42.6 million, accounting for 52 percent of world stocks.  ",
    "December_2014": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 117.0 million tons, down slightly due to a small reduction in cottonseed.  Soybean exports are increased 40 million bushels to 1,760 million reflecting the record export pace in recent weeks and prospects for additional sales and shipments ahead of the South American harvest.  With crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 410 million bushels, down 40 million from last month but still the highest since 2006/07.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2014/15 is projected at $9.00 to $11.00 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at $340 to $380 per short ton, up 10 dollars on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price range is projected at 32 to 36 cents per pound, down 2 cents on both ends reflecting lower-than-expected early season vegetable oil prices and lower petroleum prices.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 530.7 million tons, up 1.8 million tons from last month.  Foreign oilseed production accounts for most of the change on increases for soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 312.8 million tons with gains this month for Canada, Ukraine, and Paraguay.  Global rapeseed production is projected at a record 71.9 million tons, up 1.2 million mainly on increased production for Canada, which is estimated at 15.6 million tons based on the latest survey results from Statistics Canada.  Other changes include increased sunflowerseed production for EU and reduced peanut production for Argentina.  Palm oil production is reduced for Indonesia for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 on revised yields.Global oilseed trade for 2014/15 is projected at 135.3 million tons, up 0.8 million from last month.  Soybean exports account for most of the change with higher projections for the United States, Paraguay, Ukraine, and Canada only partly offset by reductions for Argentina and Brazil.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 104.1 million tons, up 1.1 million from last month and 23.5 million above year-earlier levels.  Increased rapeseed stocks in Canada and higher soybean stocks in Brazil and Argentina are only partly offset with lower soybean stocks in the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. 2014/15 total sugar supply is increased 189,844 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month to 13.919 million.  Based on sugarcane processors\u2019 forecasts, Florida sugar production is increased by 144,869 STRV due to increased sugarcane yield and area, and Texas cane sugar production is increased by 2,865 STRV due to increased yield.  Imports are increased by 42,110 STRV due to an expected increase from Mexico.  With no other changes, ending stocks increase by the supply increase and are now projected at 1.675 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.7 percent.  Elements of the U.S. 2013/14 sugar supply and use balance were adjusted to reflect revisions from Sweetener Market Data and the Foreign Agricultural Service.Mexico 2014/15 beginning stocks and production are unchanged but imports are reduced by 24,135 metric tons (MT) to reflect expected imports from the United States.  Total imports consist of 181,865 MT from the United States -- all but 10,000 MT for Mexico\u2019s sugar-containing products (IMMEX) program -- and 10,000 MT from non-U.S. sources for IMMEX. Total deliveries are reduced by 60,174 MT to reflect an expected decrease from last month in IMMEX activity.  Deliveries to IMMEX are now projected at 323,826 MT and match IMMEX activity for 2013/14.  Deliveries for consumption are unchanged and ending stocks are equal to 22.0 percent of those deliveries, or 924,000 MT, the same as last month.  Exports for 2014/15 are calculated residually at 1.715 million MT.  The 36,039 MT increase in exports is forecast to go to the U.S. market for a total of 1.390 million MT. Elements of the Mexico 2013/14 sugar supply and use balance were adjusted to reflect trade revisions from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Economy (Economia) and IMMEX activity from Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (Conadesuca).LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2014 is lowered from last month, as lower beef production in the fourth quarter more than offsets increased pork production.  Beef production is reduced as slaughter is expected lower.  However, carcass weights remain heavy which partly offsets the decline.  Hog slaughter for the fourth quarter is increased from last month as slaughter to date has been strong.  A small revision is made to third-quarter broiler slaughter but the forecasts for fourth quarter broiler and turkey production are unchanged.  For 2015, total meat production is slightly higher on small increase in beef production; other production forecasts are unchanged.  USDA will release its Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on December 23, providing an indication of producers\u2019 sow farrowing intentions into 2015. The forecast for 2014 beef imports is raised on the pace of imports to date, but the export forecast is unchanged from last month.  No change is made to 2015 forecasts.  Pork imports are raised for 2014 and exports are reduced as relatively high prices are expected to encourage imports and limit sales opportunities.  For 2015, the import forecast is raised but exports are unchanged.  No change is made to the broiler or turkey export forecasts.   The cattle price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised from last month on continued demand strength and tight supplies of fed cattle.  The hog price forecast for 2014 is lowered on current prices, but the 2015 price is unchanged.  The broiler and turkey price forecasts for 2014 are raised.  The turkey price forecast is increased for 2015 but broilers are unchanged.  The egg price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised on expectations of strong demand through the end of 2014 and into early 2015.  The milk production forecast for 2014 is unchanged from last month, but is lowered for 2015 as growth in milk per cow is expected to be more moderate.  Fat basis imports are reduced for 2014 as milkfat imports have been lower than expected.  Export forecasts on a skim-solids basis are raised for 2014 on stronger whey product sales to date.  Fat and skim-solids basis trade forecasts for 2015 are unchanged.  The butter price is raised for 2014, reflecting current price movements, but the price forecast for 2015 is unchanged at the midpoint of the range.  Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are reduced for both 2014 and 2015 as supplies are expected to remain large.  Whey prices are unchanged from last month.  Class III prices for 2014 and 2015 are lowered on weaker cheese prices.  The Class IV price is unchanged for 2014 as a higher butter price is offset by a lower NDM price.  For 2015 a lower NDM price results in a reduced Class IV price forecast.  The all milk price is lowered to $24.05 to $24.15 per cwt for 2014 and $18.45 to $19.25 per cwt for 2015.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates for 2014/15 include lower production and ending stocks compared to last month.  Production is reduced 474,000 bales, due mainly to a lower crop estimate for Texas.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 4.6 million bales, or one-third of total disappearance.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is projected at 59 to 64 cents per pound, an increase of 3 cents on the lower end of the range, based on stronger-than-expected early season prices.  Global cotton ending stocks for 2014/15 are raised again this month, as a lower consumption forecast is partially offset by lower production.  Production is reduced for the United States and Greece, with smaller revisions in several other countries.  Global consumption is reduced nearly 1.3 million bales, reflecting lower forecasts for China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, and Turkey.  While the projected world consumption growth rate of 3.3 percent remains above the historical average, current indications are that mills\u2019 response to this season\u2019s sharply lower cotton prices is lagging previous expectations.  World ending stocks are projected at just over 108 million bales.",
    "March_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2018/19 include higher crush and lower ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s report.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 2,100 million on higher domestic disappearance of soybean meal and a lower soybean meal extraction rate reflecting data reported by NASS in the Oilseed Crushings report.  With exports unchanged, soybean stocks are projected at 900 million bushels, down 10 million from last month.  With increased crush, soybean oil production is raised 115 million pounds to 24.6 billion.  Soybean oil used for methyl ester production for biodiesel is raised 200 million pounds to 8.2 billion on record production for the first quarter of the marketing year (Oct-Sept).  With increased production more than offset by higher use, soybean oil stocks are forecast lower.The season-average soybean price range forecast of $8.10 to $9.10 per bushel is unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean oil and meal prices are also unchanged at 28.5 to 31.5 cents per pound and $295 to $335 per short ton, respectively.The 2018/19 global oilseed outlook includes lower production, crush, and increased stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is down 0.2 million tons, with lower soybean production more than offsetting higher rapeseed and cottonseed.  Soybean production is reduced 0.9 million tons to 360.1 million on lower production for Brazil and Paraguay.  Production for Brazil is down 0.5 million tons to 116.5 million, reflecting dry weather conditions and lower yields for Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias.   Global oilseed crush is down 0.5 million tons mainly on lower soybean crush for China, which is down on slower-than-expected pace to date.  China\u2019s soybean crush pace is expected to increase during the second half of the marketing year as the South American harvest advances and leads to increased global supplies.  Global oilseed ending stocks are up 0.8 million tons to 121.7 million, with soybeans accounting for 0.5 million of the increase.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2018/19 is increased 103,694 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.004 million based on a lower projected shrink of 5.0 percent, down from 6.9 percent last month, and a slight increase in projected recovery from sliced beets. Cane sugar production is decreased 18,050 STRV to 4.099 million based on reporting by processors in Florida and Texas. Imports from Mexico for 2018/19 are projected to decrease 223,635 STRV to 896,692 while high-tier tariff imports are projected to increase 10,000 STRV to 55,000 based on the pace to date. With no change to 2018/19 use, ending stocks are projected at 1.668 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.55 percent.Mexico production for 2018/19 is increased to 6.152 million metric tons (MT) based on higher projected area for harvest and on updated projections of sugarcane yield and recovery based on the pace established for those values through early March. Deliveries of sugar for human consumption are increased 201,611 MT to 4.615 million.  Per capita sweetener consumption is projected at a level consistent with that for 2016/17 and consumption of high fructose corn syrup is reduced to 1.555 million MT based on a slower pace to date than previously forecast. Exports to the United States are projected down 191,395 MT to 767,420 MT. This is sum of exports under license for 2018/19 plus 1,842 MT reported by CONADESUCA corresponding to export licenses for 2017/18 extended for a period between October 1 and 15. Projected Mexico exports under 2018/19 license are the greater of 100 percent of U.S. Needs calculated from U.S. supply and use in this WASDE or the export limit previously established by the Commerce Department on December 18, 2018. Exports to non-U.S. destinations are increased 27,614 MT based on realized exports through February 23, 2019. Total exports to all destinations sum to 1.102 million MT. Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected residually at 1.420 million MT, implying a stocks-to-human consumption ratio of 30.8 percent.Exports to the United States are projected down 191,395 MT to 767,420 MT. This is sum of exports under license for 2018/19 plus 1,842 MT reported by CONADESUCA corresponding to export licenses for 2017/18 extended for a period between October 1 and 15.

Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected residually at 1.420 million MT, implying a stocks-to-human consumption ratio of 30.8 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2019 is lowered from the previous month as lower forecast beef and turkey production more than offsets higher pork production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month on the pace of fed cattle slaughter in the first quarter and lower expected marketings in mid-2019.  Partly offsetting the lower fed cattle slaughter is higher expected cow slaughter.  The lower production forecast also reflects lighter carcass weights in 2019.  The pork production forecast is raised slightly on the current pace of slaughter and heavier first-quarter carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is unchanged from last month.  The turkey production forecast is decreased as hatchery data is pointing to lower-than-previously expected poult placements.  Forecast egg production is increased on continued growth in the laying flock. The 2019 beef, broiler, turkey, and egg trade forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  Pork imports are lowered for 2019, reflecting larger domestic supplies and limited demand for foreign product.  Forecast pork exports are lowered on slower international demand for U.S. pork products.  Cattle price forecasts are raised for 2019 on current price strength and expectations of firm demand throughout the year.  First- and third-quarter hog prices are reduced from the previous month.  First-quarter broiler and egg price forecasts are reduced on recent price data.  First-half turkey prices are raised. For 2019, the milk production forecast is lowered on smaller expected dairy cow numbers.  The fat basis export forecast is reduced on slower expected sales of butterfat due to increased global competition.  Skim-solids basis exports are lowered on expected strong competition in international skim milk powder markets and slower expected demand for whey products.  The fat basis import forecast is lowered slightly while the skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged. Annual product price forecasts for cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM) are raised from the previous month, but the whey price forecast is reduced slightly.  The Class III price is raised as the higher cheese price projection more than offsets the lower whey price.  The Class IV price is increased on higher forecast butter and NDM prices.  The all milk price forecast is raised to average $17.00 to $17.60 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2018/19 cotton supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month.  The projected range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 69.0 to 71.0 cents per pound is reduced 2 cents, as the reported average price for January fell below previous expectations.This month\u2019s 2018/19 world cotton estimates show higher production and ending stocks, and slightly lower trade.  Production is estimated up 350,000 bales in Brazil on higher area and 200,000 bales up in Pakistan based on arrivals at gins.  Production is 100,000 bales lower in Australia due to weather.  World trade is forecast 140,000 bales lower with reductions for Brazil and Indonesia on the export and import sides based on activity to date.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are forecast 590,000 bales higher this month, at 76.1 million bales.  This would be 5.1 million bales below their revised 2017/18 level. ",
    "March_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2017/18 include higher crush, lower exports, and increased ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s report.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,960 million with increased soybean meal exports.  Soybean exports are reduced 35 million bushels to 2,065 million with increased production and exports for Brazil.  Soybean stocks are projected at 555 million bushels, up 25 million from last month.  With increased crush, soybean oil production is raised.  An increase in food use is more than offset by lower biodiesel use, leaving domestic disappearance lower this month.  Lower biodiesel use reflects lower-than-expected soyoil-based biodiesel production through the first quarter of the marketing year.  With increased production and lower use, soybean oil stocks are forecast higher.The season-average soybean price range forecast of $9.00 to $9.60 per bushel is unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 30 to 33 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $325 to $355 per short ton, up $20.00 at the midpoint.  Higher soybean meal prices reflect the impact of sharply lower soybean production in Argentina.Global oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 574.5 million tons, down 4.1 million from last month.  Argentina soybean production is forecast at 47.0 million tons, down 7.0 million from last month mainly due to lower projected yields resulting from dry conditions through much of the growing region in January and February.  Brazil soybean production is raised 1.0 million tons to 113.0 million, reflecting the most recent report from the Brazilian government.  Global rapeseed production is projected at 73.9 million tons, up 0.9 million with larger crops for China and Australia partly offset with a smaller crop projected for India.  Other changes include higher sunflowerseed production for China and Kazakhstan, lower sunflowerseed production for Russia, and higher cottonseed production for Sudan.Global oilseed trade for 2017/18 is reduced 1.2 million tons mainly on lower soybean exports.   Lower soybean exports forecast for Argentina, the United States, and Uruguay are only partly offset with a higher projection for Brazil.  Global soybean crush is raised with higher crush projected for Brazil and the United States partly offset by lower crush in Argentina.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 94.4 million tons, down 3.7 million from last month.  Reduced soybean stocks in Argentina and Brazil are only partly offset by an increase for the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. cane sugar production is increased 10,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.021 million based on a processor report from Texas.  Re-export imports for 2017/18 are increased by 150,000 STRV to 400,000 based on pace to date.  Exports for 2017/18 are increased by 50,000 STRV to 150,000.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are residually projected at 1.953 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 15.5 percent, up from last month\u2019s 14.6 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2017/18 is decreased by 50,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.050 million due to lower sugarcane area.  Imports are increased 35,000 MT to 170,000 based on increased pace to date reported by the Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (CONADESUCA) through the end of January 2018.  According to CONADESUCA, the increase reflects imports for consumption of sugar sourced from the United States.  The projection of Mexico sugar exports to the United States is raised by 984 MT, reflecting sugar that was exported under a 2016/17 export license but recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau as imported in 2017/18.  The 2017/18 Export Limit previously established by the U.S. Department of Commerce exceeds the projected Target Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs calculated from the March 2018 WASDE.  Unchanged ending stocks are projected at 22.0 percent of consumption to meet needs before the start of production in 2018/19.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are residually projected at 260,997 MT, a decrease of 15,984 from last month. Mexico sugar production for 2017/18 is decreased by 50,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.050 million due to lower sugarcane area.  Imports are increased 35,000 MT to 170,000 based on increased pace to date reported by the Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (CONADESUCA) through the end of January 2018.  According to CONADESUCA, the increase reflects imports for consumption of sugar sourced from the United States.  The projection of Mexico sugar exports to the United States is raised by 984 MT, reflecting sugar that was exported under a 2016/17 export license but recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau as imported in 2017/18.  The 2017/18 Export Limit previously established by the U.S. Department of Commerce exceeds the projected Target Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs calculated from the March 2018 WASDE.

Exports to non-U.S. destinations are residually projected at 260,997 MT, a decrease of 15,984 from last month. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2018 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is fractionally lower than last month, as lower beef production more than offsets higher pork and turkey production.  Broiler production is unchanged.  The beef production forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower first-quarter slaughter and lower weights.  However, the decline is offset somewhat by higher second-quarter fed beef production and higher non-fed beef production during the first half of the year.  Pork production is lowered for the first half of the year on a slower pace of slaughter, but higher carcass weights are expected and second-half production is increased.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on March 29th, providing an indication of producer intentions for farrowings in the next two quarters.  First-quarter egg production is reduced on recent hatchery data.  Estimates of 2017 broiler, turkey meat, and egg supply and utilization are adjusted to reflect revised annual production and storage summary data. For 2018, beef imports are raised as early-year demand remains robust.  No change is made to beef exports.  The pork import forecast is raised on expected demand strength.  Export forecasts are also raised from last month.  Broiler exports are unchanged, but turkey exports are reduced slightly on weaker expected demand in key markets.  Cattle and hog prices for the first quarter of 2018 are raised from last month on current price movements.  The second-quarter broiler price forecast is raised from last month on stronger expected demand.  Turkey prices are reduced through the third quarter on the continued slow recovery in demand.  Egg price forecasts are raised on robust demand. The milk production forecast for 2018 is raised from last month on more rapid growth in milk per cow in the first half of the year.  The 2018 imports on a fat and skim-solids basis are reduced on slower sales of a number of processed dairy products.  Exports on fat basis are raised on increased cheese sales and exports on a skim-solids basis are raised on stronger sales of both cheese and whey products.  The supply and use estimates are adjusted to reflect revisions to 2016 and 2017 milk production and 2017 storage data.Annual product price forecasts for cheese and butter are raised from the previous month as recent prices have increased.  However, continued large supplies of nonfat dry milk (NDM) are expected to pressure NDM prices, and the forecast is reduced.  No change is made to the annual whey price forecast.  The Class III price is raised on the cheese price projection, while the Class IV price is down, as the lower NDM price more than offsets a higher butter price forecast.  The all milk price is forecast at $15.75 to $16.35 per cwt, unchanged at the midpoint.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. cotton forecasts show lower production, higher exports, and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced 233,000 bales to 21.0 million, based on the March 8 Cotton Ginnings report.  The final estimates for this season\u2019s U.S. area, yield, and production will be published in the May 2018 Crop Production report.  Domestic mill use is unchanged from last month, but exports are raised 300,000 bales to 14.8 million, based on stronger world demand and expectations of above-average shipments during the second half of the marketing year.  Ending stocks are lowered 500,000 bales to 5.5 million.  The projected range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 68.0 to 70.0 cents per pound is narrowed by 1 cent at each end from last month.The forecast for 2017/18 global production is raised nearly 600,000 bales this month due to revisions in Sudan\u2019s estimates back to 2013/14 and higher area in Australia, partially offset by smaller crops in the United States and Uzbekistan.  Sudan\u2019s 2017/18 forecast is raised 730,000 bales based on reports of new technology and investment, and Australia\u2019s production is raised 300,000 bales following reports area previously forecast for sorghum was planted to cotton. World consumption is raised slightly, while world trade is forecast 600,000 bales higher, as higher expected imports by Turkey, Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam more than offset a decline for Taiwan.  World ending stocks are now projected at 88.8 million bales, nearly 300,000 bales above last month.",
    "December_2015": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is forecast at 117.7 million tons, down slightly due to a small reduction in cottonseed.  Soybean supply and use projections for 2015/16 are unchanged from last month.  Soybean ending stocks are unchanged at 465 million bushels which, if realized, would be the highest since 2006/07.  Soybean oil used for methyl ester is raised 200 million pounds for 2015/16 reflecting the recent Environmental Protection Agency announcement of the biodiesel mandate for 2016.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2015/16 is forecast at $8.15 to $9.65 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal is forecast at $290 to $330 per short ton, down 10 dollars on both ends of the range.  Soybean oil is forecast at 28.5 to 31.5 cents per pound, up 1 cent on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 529.0 million tons, down 2.0 million tons with foreign oilseeds accounting for most of the change.  Global soybean production is projected at 320.1 million tons, down 0.9 million.  The India soybean crop is reduced 1.5 million tons to 8.0 million on lower yields resulting from inconsistent rainfall during the growing season and late-season heat.  Larger projections for Canada, Russia, and Ukraine partly offset the reduction for India.  Global rapeseed production is projected at 67.5 million tons, up 0.5 million with a larger crop in Canada only partly offset by a lower forecast for India.  Canada rapeseed production is raised 1.7 million tons to 17.2 million based on the latest survey results from Statistics Canada.  The India crop is reduced on lower projected area, reflecting planting progress to date.  Palm oil production is reduced for Indonesia and Malaysia for 2015/16 reflecting unusually dry conditions from June through October 2015.  The Indonesia crop is reduced 2.0 million tons to 33.0 million and the Malaysia crop is reduced 0.5 million tons to 20.5 million.  Other changes include reduced cottonseed production for China and Pakistan.Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is projected at 147.7 million tons, up 0.7 million from last month.  Soybean exports account for most of the change with higher projections for Argentina, Serbia, and Ukraine.  Soybean imports are raised for Pakistan, Taiwan, and Iran.  Rapeseed exports are also higher with an increase for Canada only partly offset by a lower projection for Australia.  Global oilseed crush is projected lower primarily on reduced rapeseed and soybean crush for India.  For Pakistan, increased soybean crush partly offsets lower rapeseed and cottonseed crush.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 95.1 million tons, up 1.0 million mainly reflecting increased rapeseed stocks in Canada.  Global vegetable oil stocks are projected at 16.1 million tons, down 2.3 million mainly on lower palm oil stocks in Indonesia, Malaysia, and India.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar production for 2015/16 is projected at 8.991 million short tons, raw value (STRV), an increase of 181,104 over last month.  Beet sugar is projected 82,775 STRV higher at 5.158 million based on higher processor estimated sucrose content.  Florida cane sugar production is projected 133,329 STRV higher at 2.073 million based on the NASS forecast of sugarcane for sugar and processors\u2019 projected recovery.  Louisiana cane sugar production is reduced 35,000 STRV to 1.465 million based on the harvest pace to date and planned harvest end dates. Imports from Mexico for 2015/16 are reduced by 207,902 STRV to 1.333 million, and deliveries for human consumption are increased by 170,000 to 11.955 million based on final direct consumption import data and full-year alternative sweeteners data.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.659 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Mexico 2014/15 sugar imports are estimated at 128,235 metric tons (MT), a reduction of 23,682 from last month based on end-of-year government import reporting.  Sugar exports to the United States for 2014/15 are estimated at 1.311 million MT, a reduction of 15,250.  This is based on a correction to U.S. import data by the Foreign Agricultural Service for a known revision in shipment data that will not be revised by the U.S. Census Bureau until a later date.  Sugar deliveries to the IMMEX sugar-containing products export program are estimated at 336,797 MT, an increase of 12,971 based on government reporting.  This estimate is carried forward for the 2015/16 projection.  For 2015/16, exports to the United States are projected at 1.140 million MT, down 177,929 based on changes made in the December 2015 sugar WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are forecast residually at 1.147 million MT implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 26.14 percent.Mexico 2014/15 sugar imports are estimated at 128,235 metric tons (MT), a reduction of 23,682 from last month based on end-of-year government import reporting.  Sugar exports to the United States for 2014/15 are estimated at 1.311 million MT, a reduction of 15,250.

This estimate is carried forward for the 2015/16 projection.  For 2015/16, exports to the United States are projected at 1.140 million MT, down 177,929 based on changes made in the December 2015 sugar WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are forecast residually at 1.147 million MT implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 26.14 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month.  Beef production is lowered for 2015 due to a slower pace of fed cattle marketings and consequently, lower steer and heifer slaughter.  However, as the pace of marketings is slower, carcass weights are expected to be heavier, providing a slight counterbalance to lower slaughter.  For 2016, lower expected cattle placements during late 2015 will result in lower slaughter and beef production in mid-2016.  However, there is a slight offset from higher expected carcass weights early in the year.  Pork production is raised for 2015 on the pace of slaughter in November and early December.  No change is made to 2016.  USDA will release its Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on December 23, providing an indication of producers\u2019 hog production intentions into 2016.  Broiler production is lowered for both 2015 and 2016 as hatchery data points to slower growth in broiler production.  Egg production is lowered in 2015 based on recent production data, but hatchery data supports a slightly higher production forecast for early 2016.Beef imports for 2015 and 2016 are reduced to reflect the pace to date and weakening prices for processing beef.  Beef exports for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged.  Pork imports are unchanged but export forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are reduced as the strength of the dollar is limiting export competitiveness.  Broiler and turkey exports for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged from last month.  Cattle and hog prices for 2015 are lowered from last month.  A combination of weaker-than-expected packer demand and relatively large supplies of cattle and hogs are expected to pressure prices.  Cattle prices are reduced for all of 2016 and hog prices are lowered for early 2016.  Broiler prices are raised for 2015 on current price movements, but are unchanged for 2016.  Turkey prices for 2015 are reduced on current prices, but are unchanged for 2016.  Egg prices are lowered for the end of 2015 and into early 2016, reflecting recent price movements.The milk production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month as growth in milk per cow in 2015 and 2016 is slowed.  Fat basis imports are reduced for 2015 on slower butter imports; on a skim-solids basis, imports are unchanged.  No change is made to 2016 imports. Fat basis exports are unchanged for 2015 but are lowered for 2016 as global supplies of dairy products are expected to remain large and sales of cheese are expected to be pressured.  On a skim-solids basis, exports are lowered for 2015 as lactose and whey protein concentrates sales to date are limiting exports, and weaker expected sales of cheese and lactose in 2016 will dampen skim-solids export growth in 2016.   Butter prices for remainder of 2015 and early 2016 are raised as prices have remained stronger than expected into early December.  Cheese prices are lowered slightly for 2015 and 2016 based on current price movements and expected larger domestic supplies.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are reduced for 2015 and 2016 as domestic and international supplies are expected to pressure prices.  Whey prices are unchanged from last month.  Class III prices are unchanged for 2015 and 2016 as the cheese price change was small.  Class IV prices are raised for 2015 due to the stronger forecast butter price which more than offsets the lower NDM price.  The 2016 Class IV price is lowered as the NDM price forecast is reduced.  The all milk price is raised to $17.05 to $17.15 per cwt for 2015 and lowered to $15.95 to $16.75 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton 2015/16 supply and demand forecasts include reduced production and exports this month; ending stocks are revised down marginally.  The U.S. crop is forecast at 13.0 million bales, down 250,000 from last month, due mainly to lower production in North and South Carolina.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are reduced 200,000 based on the lower available supply and lagging sales to date.  Ending stocks of 3.0 million bales account for 22 percent of total disappearance.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 56 to 62 cents per pound is narrowed 1 cent on each end, with the midpoint unchanged at 59 cents.The world cotton 2015/16 projections show lower production, consumption, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Global production is reduced 1.9 million bales, as reductions for Pakistan, China, the United States, Turkey, Greece, and Turkmenistan are partially offset by an increase for Australia.  Total consumption is down slightly, reflecting reductions for China, India, and Pakistan, which are mostly offset by increases for Vietnam and Bangladesh.  Projected world trade is raised 1.0 million bales, reflecting larger expected imports for Pakistan, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, but lower imports for China.  Exports are raised for India, Brazil, and Australia, but are reduced for the United States.  World ending stocks are now projected 1.7 million bales below last month at 104.4 million.",
    "August_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2022/23 include higher beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks.  Beginning soybean stocks are raised on lower 2021/22 exports.  Soybean production for 2022/23 is forecast at 4.53 billion bushels, up 26 million with higher yields more than offsetting lower harvested area.  Harvested area is forecast at 87.2 million acres, down 0.3 million from July.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 51.9 bushels per acre is raised 0.4 bushels from last month.  Soybean supplies for 2022/23 are projected at 4.8 billion bushels, up 36 million from last month.  U.S. soybean exports are raised 20 million bushels to 2.16 billion on increased supplies.  Soybean ending stocks are forecast at 245 million bushels, up 15 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2022/23 is forecast at $14.35 per bushel, down 5 cents from last month.  Soybean meal and oil price forecasts are unchanged at $390 per short ton and 69.0 cents per pound, respectively.The 2022/23 global oilseed supply and use forecasts include higher production, crush, exports, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is raised 2.9 million tons to 646.0 million with higher forecasts for soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed partly offset with lower cottonseed production in the United States.  In addition to higher production for the United States, soybean production for China is increased on higher area cited in recent provincial reports.  Australia\u2019s canola crop is raised 0.7 million tons to 6.1 million on higher yields resulting from favorable weather conditions.  Russia\u2019s rapeseed crop is forecasted at a record 3.9 million tons, up 1.1 million from the previous forecast on sharply higher area.  Russia\u2019s sunflowerseed production is raised 1.5 million tons to 17 million, also on higher reported area.  Sunflowerseed production is reduced for the EU and South Africa.  Lower EU production reflects hot, dry conditions in July.Global 2022/23 oilseed crush is raised on higher soybean crush for Brazil and higher rapeseed and sunflowerseed crush for Russia.  With increased supplies, rapeseed exports are raised for Australia and Russia.  Global rapeseed exports are also raised with the addition of Uruguay to global supply and demand estimates.  Sunflowerseed imports are raised for the EU and Belarus paired with increased exports for Russia and Ukraine.  Global oilseed stocks are raised with higher soybean and rapeseed stocks partly offset with lower sunflowerseed stocks.SUGAR:  U.S. 2022/23 sugar supply is increased by 249,762 short tons, raw value (STRV) on higher beginning stocks and higher projected production.  Stocks carried over from 2021/22 are 45,769 STRV larger than estimated last month mostly on an increase in high-tier tariff imports, now estimated at 325,000 based on the pace of both raw and refined sugar imports through the first week of August.  Beet sugar production is increased by 203,993 STRV on the NASS forecast of sugarbeet yield higher (29.2 tons/acre) than last month\u2019s WASDE forecast (27.9 tons/acre).  There are no changes to trade or to use.  Ending stocks are increased to 1,814,227 STRV implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.32 percent, up from 12.35 percent last month.Mexico production for 2021/22 is increased by 5,237 metric tons (MT) to 6,185,050 on end-of-campaign reporting by CONADESUCA.  Exports in 2021/22 are increased by the same amount.  There are no other changes in either 2021/22 or 2022/23. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is fractionally higher than last month as higher beef and broiler forecasts are partly offset by lower pork and turkey.  Beef production is raised for the second half with higher expected slaughter.  Pork production is lowered on lower third quarter slaughter.  Broiler production is raised on recent production data and higher expected production in the fourth quarter.  Turkey production is forecast lower based on slaughter to date and hatchery data.  Egg production is raised from last month on recent hatchery data.For 2023, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised on higher beef production.  The beef forecast was raised, reflecting higher expected placements in late 2022 and the 2022 calf crop reported in the latest Cattle report.  Turkey production is lowered slightly, while the pork and broiler production forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The more rapid pace of egg production growth in 2022 is expected to carry into early 2023.The beef import forecast for 2022 is lowered on second quarter data and expectations of slower imports, largely from Oceania.  Imports for 2023 are unchanged from last month.  Exports are raised for both years on larger beef supplies and continued firm demand from Asian markets.  Pork imports and exports are adjusted for 2022 on recent data; the forecasts for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 are unchanged.  Broiler exports for 2022 and 2023 are lowered on recent data and expectations of slower demand in price sensitive markets.  Turkey exports are raised on the latest trade data, but no change is made to the forecast for the outlying quarters of 2022.  The forecast for 2023 is raised on expectations of improving demand. Cattle price forecasts for 2022 are raised on current price strength.  This is expected to carry into early 2023 and prices were raised for the first quarter.  The 2022 hog price forecast is raised on expectations of higher second-half prices, but no changes are made to 2023.  The broiler price forecast for 2022 is lowered as prices decline from their highs earlier in the year.  This decline is carried into the first half of 2023.  Turkey price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on current prices and expectations of firming demand.  The third-quarter 2022 egg price forecast is raised as egg prices peaked at record levels in July before beginning to decline.  Forecasts for the fourth quarter and 2023 are unchanged.  The milk production forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised from last month.  The cow inventory is raised in both years based on the July 1 dairy cow inventory provided in the recent Cattle report.  Output-per-cow is forecast to increase at a slightly more rapid pace in 2022 and the 2023 forecast is raised as well.Based on recent trade data, fat basis imports for 2022 are lowered from last month, but skim-solids basis imports are unchanged.  Imports for 2023 are lowered reflecting larger domestic supplies.  Exports on both a skim-solids basis and on a fat basis are raised for 2022 on recent data and expectations of larger available supplies.  Export forecasts for 2023 on both fat and skim-solids bases are raised from last month on larger expected supplies.Forecasts for 2022 butter prices are raised slightly from last month on current price strength, but the 2022 cheese price is forecast lower with expectations of larger supplies and continued large stocks.  The forecasts for nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey prices are also lower on observed prices and expected supplies.  The Class III price is lowered on both lower cheese and whey prices, and the Class IV price lowered as the higher butter price is more than offset by the lower NDM price.  The all milk price for 2022 is lowered to $25.20 per cwt.  For 2023, forecasts for cheese, butter, NDM, and whey are all lowered on expectations of greater supplies and strong competition in international markets.  With lower product prices, the Class III and Class IV price forecasts are lowered.  The 2023 all milk price forecast is lowered to $22.50 per cwt.COTTON:  In this month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. cotton projections, beginning stocks are slightly larger, and a nearly 3-million-bale decrease in production results in lower exports, mill use, and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are larger as estimated exports for 2021/22 are reduced 100,000 bales based on final Export Sales data and Census Bureau data through June.  NASS\u2019s first survey-based estimate of production for 2022/23 is 12.6 million bales\u2014the lowest since 2009/10\u2014with the crop reduced by projected historically high abandonment in the Southwest.  Exports are projected 2 million bales lower than in July and mill use is 200,000 lower.  Ending stocks are 600,000 bales lower, equating to 12.6 percent of expected use, 8 percentage points lower than in 2021/22, and the lowest stock/use ratio since 1924/25.  The U.S. season-average price for upland cotton is forecast 2 cents higher this month at 97 cents/lb.Global 2022/23 production is forecast 3.1 million bales lower this month, and consumption is 800,000 bales lower, resulting in a decrease in projected ending stocks of 1.5 million bales.  In addition to the U.S. crop change, world production is reduced an additional 100,000 bales as extreme heat in Uzbekistan reduced yield prospects there.  World trade is 1.8 million bales lower this month, with reductions in U.S. exports and imports by China as the largest changes.  Projected imports are also lower this month for India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Turkey, and Bangladesh.  Consumption in 2022/23 is projected lower than a month ago in the United States, Pakistan, Vietnam, Turkey, and Bangladesh.  ",
    "May_2021": "OILSEEDS:  The 2021/22 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for lower supplies, lower exports, higher crush, and higher ending stocks compared with 2020/21.  The soybean crop is projected at 4.4 billion bushels, up 270 million from last year on increased harvested area and trend yields.  With lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected down 3 percent from 2020/21.  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2021/22 is forecast at 130.3 million tons, up 7.9 million from 2020/21.  U.S. soybean crush for 2021/22 is projected at 2.2 billion bushels, up 35 million from the 2020/21 forecast, reflecting favorable crush margins.  Soybean oil is expected to hold a higher share of the crush value as prices are buoyed by increased use of soybean oil as a feedstock in an expanding renewable diesel industry.  The soybean oil balance sheet line entitled \u201cBiodiesel\u201d is replaced by \u201cBiofuel\u201d this month.  The biofuel line includes soybean oil used for both biodiesel and renewable fuels as reported in the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Monthly Biofuels Capacity and Feedstocks Update, which replaced the Monthly Biodiesel Production Report.  Prior year estimates for renewable fuel are based on data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resource Board, and capacity information from industry.      U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2.1 billion bushels, down 205 million from 2020/21.  With lower soybean supplies and higher crush, the U.S. export share of global soybean trade is expected to decline to 33 percent from 36 percent in 2020/21.  U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 140 million bushels, up 20 million from the 2020/21 forecast.  With prices for fall delivery above $14.00 per bushel in some locations, the 2021/22 U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $13.85 per bushel, up $2.60 from 2020/21.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $400 per short ton, down $5.00 from the revised forecast for 2020/21.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 65.0 cents per pound, up 10 cents from the revised 2020/21 forecast.Global oilseed supplies for 2021/22 are projected to increase 3 percent from 2020/21 to 732.4 million tons, with higher prices incentivizing an expansion of oilseed area and higher sunflowerseed production after the prior season\u2019s yield-related declines.  Global soybean production is forecast up 22.6 million tons to 385.5 million.  Brazil\u2019s crop is forecast at a record 144.0 million tons while Argentina\u2019s crop rises 5.0 million tons to 52 million.  Global production of high-oil content seeds (sunflowerseed and rapeseed) is projected up 6 percent from 2020/21 on a recovery of sunflowerseed production for Ukraine, Russia, and the EU and increased canola for Canada.  Global soybean exports are expected to increase 1 percent to 172.9 million tons.  The U.S. share of global exports is forecast to decline while Brazil\u2019s share increases from 50 percent in 2020/21 to 54 percent in 2021/22.  China\u2019s imports are forecast to increase 3 million tons to 103 million.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 91.1 million tons, up 4.6 million, with most of the increase in China and Brazil.  Global vegetable oil consumption for 2021/22 is projected at 213.2 million tons, up 3.0 percent, led by increases for China and the United States.  Global vegetable oil ending stocks are projected at 22.4 million tons, down 3 percent from 2020/21 and the lowest in 11 years.SUGAR:  U.S. sugarbeet production for 2021/22 is projected at 35.140 million tons with yield forecast at 30.71 tons/acre and area harvested projected at 1.144 million acres.  National yield is projected on analysis of historical regional trends and also reflects excellent planting progress through early May.  Assuming average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production is projected at 5.225 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Cane sugar production for 2021/22 is projected at 4.085 million STRV.  Production levels in Florida and Texas are expected to be close to 2020/21 levels and production in Louisiana is down from the 2020/21 record but still strong at 1.850 million STRV.  Florida cane sugar for 2020/21 is down 70,000 STRV to 2.100 million on lower sugar yields estimated by processors.TRQ imports for 2021/22 are projected at 1.387 million STRV with levels set at minimum levels consistent with the WTO and FTA bindings and with a TRQ shortfall projected at 99,208.  High-tier tariff imports for 2021/22 are projected at 50,000 STRV.  Imports from Mexico for 2021/22 are projected at 964,775 STRV.  For 2020/21, imports from Mexico are up by 50,000 STRV to reflect the recent increase in the \u201cOther Sugars\u201d Export Limit.  The raw sugar TRQ shortfall is increased to 146,854 STRV.  Deliveries for 2021/22 are projected at 12.320 million STRV, flat with levels estimated for 2020/21.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are residually projected at 1.502 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.25 percent.Mexico production for 2021/22 is projected at 5.809 million metric tons (MT).  Below average yields are projected due to poor soil conditions from ongoing drought and low area replacement turnover. Production for 2020/21 is reduced by 75,000 MT to 5.825 million on a combination of lower area and reduced sugar yields.  Deliveries of sugar and high fructose corn syrup are projected to decline in both 2020/21 and 2021/22 due to government actions to curb consumption of high-calorie foods, weakness in the economy, and high inflation. Ending stocks for both 2020/21 and 2021/22 are set equal to 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar deliveries before the start of the succeeding sugarcane harvest.  Total exports are residually projected but exports to the United States are projected at the expected level of U.S. Needs, which provisionally assumes a level for the 2021/22 U.S. additional specialty TRQ at the same level as 2020/21; that is, 140,000 MT, raw value. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production for 2022 is forecast above 2021 as higher pork and poultry production more than offset lower beef production.  Beef production is forecast lower on smaller year-over-year slaughter levels.  Pork production is forecast to increase primarily on growth in farrowings and pigs per litter.  Broiler production is forecast above 2021 as producers respond to higher prices this year and into 2022, but growth will be tempered by higher feed prices.  Turkey production is forecast to increase in response to favorable prices, but higher feed prices will likely dampen the rate of expansion.  Egg production is forecast higher on stronger prices in 2021.  Total beef and pork exports are little changed from 2021.  Beef imports are slightly lower, but pork imports are projected to increase slightly.  Broiler and turkey exports are forecast higher on expected gains in foreign demand.  Cattle prices are forecast above 2021 on expected tightening of supplies and continued firm demand.  Hog and broiler prices are forecast lower with increased production.  Turkey and egg prices are forecast higher on strength in demand.  The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2021 is increased from last month.  Beef production is raised on higher fed and non-fed cattle slaughter.  Pork production is reduced slightly on lighter carcass weights.  Broiler production is reduced on first-quarter slaughter data; no changes are made to the outlying quarters.  Turkey production is lowered, reflecting recent hatchery data.  Egg production is lowered on hatchery and flock data.  Beef, pork, and broiler exports are raised on recent trade data and expectations of stronger growth to a number of key markets.  Turkey exports are reduced slightly.  Beef imports are raised as lower imports from Australia are partly offset by product from other suppliers.  The annual cattle price forecast is little changed from last month.  Hog, broiler, and turkey prices are raised each quarter on prices to date and expectations of demand strength in the second half of the year. Milk production for 2022 is forecast higher than 2021 as continued gains in milk per cow more than offset a slight reduction in the dairy cow herd.  Commercial exports on a fat basis are forecast lower as higher domestic butter prices reduce competitiveness in world markets.  However, strong global demand and weaker domestic prices for cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey are expected to support slightly higher exports on a skim-solids basis.  Fat basis imports are forecast lower on lower expected imports of butterfat products and cheese, while skim-solids basis imports are expected to decline mainly on lower cheese imports.  Butter prices are forecast higher, but cheese prices are forecast lower as an increased proportion of milk is expected to move into cheese production.  NDM and whey prices are lowered reflecting competition in international markets.  The Class III price is lowered on weaker cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is lowered as lower NDM more than offsets higher butter prices.  The 2022 all milk price is forecast at $18.50 per cwt.The 2021 milk production forecast is raised on higher cow inventories.  Fat basis exports are raised on higher expected exports of butterfat products.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered as weaker-than-previously expected NDM/SMP sales more than offset higher expected whey-product exports.  Fat basis and skim-solids basis import forecasts are raised from last month on recent import data and higher expected second-quarter butterfat imports.  Cheese, NDM, and whey prices are raised from the previous month, but butter is lowered.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are raised.  The 2021 all milk price is forecast at $18.95.COTTON:  U.S. cotton production in 2021/22 is projected to rise 2.4 million bales, but total supply is projected at its lowest in 5 years, and both exports and ending stocks are forecast lower than in 2020/21.  Production is anticipated at 17.0 million bales, with 12.0 million planted acres as indicated in Prospective Plantings, abandonment projected above the average of the past 5 years, and average yields.  Exports are expected to fall 1.6 million bales, to 14.7 million.  Domestic mill use is projected to rise 200,000 bales, to 2.5 million, and ending stocks are 200,000 bales lower to 3.1 million.  The upland cotton farm price is 75 cents per pound, 10 percent higher than in 2020/21.For 2020/21, U.S. cotton production is reduced slightly from last month.  The export forecast is increased 500,000 bales to 16.25 million as the expected U.S. share of world trade rises, and ending stocks are estimated 600,000 bales lower than in April, at 3.3 million.The world 2021/22 cotton projections show global supply about unchanged from a year earlier\u2014as rising production offsets lower beginning stocks\u2014and falling ending stocks, as consumption rises to its highest in 4 years.  Production is projected at 119.4 million bales, 6.3 million higher than in 2020/21.  Higher production is expected in Brazil, Australia, Mali, Pakistan, India, and Turkey; a 2.0-million-bale decline is projected for China\u2019s crop.  Global consumption is forecast to rise 3.5 percent to 121.5 million bales as global income growth remains strong.  Global ending stocks are expected to shrink by 2.2 million bales, to 91.0 million, equivalent to 75 percent of use.For 2020/21, global production saw little net change from April, but beginning stocks and consumption are projected lower, and estimated global ending stocks are 300,000 bales lower.  Indian 2019/20 and 2020/21 production is reduced by a total of 1.2 million bales.  China\u2019s 2020/21 crop is raised 500,000 bales, reflecting ginning and inspection data from Xinjiang.  Global consumption is forecast 439,000 bales lower this month, as India\u2019s recent textile exports and economic disruption from COVID-19 reduced expected mill use there by 800,000 bales.  ",
    "October_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 126.2 million tons, up 1.9 million from last month with increased soybean, canola, and sunflowerseed production partly offset with lower cottonseed and peanuts.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,269 million bushels, up 68 million mainly on higher yields.  The soybean yield is projected at 51.4 bushels per acre, up 0.8 bushels from the September forecast.  Soybean supplies for 2016/17 are projected 70 million bushels above last month with slightly higher beginning stocks adding to higher production.U.S. soybean exports for 2016/17 are projected at 2,025 million bushels, up 40 million with increased supplies.  An offsetting reduction is forecast for Argentina soybean exports.  With soybean crush unchanged, ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 395 million bushels, up 30 million from last month.  The soybean price is projected at $8.30 to $9.80 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal and soybean oil price projections are also unchanged at $300 to $340 per short ton and 30.5 to 33.5 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 548.1 million tons, up 3.6 million from last month mainly on higher soybean production.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 333.2 million tons, up 2.8 million with higher forecasts for the United States, Brazil, and Canada partly offset by a reduction for Russia.  Brazil soybean production is projected at a record 102.0 million tons on higher area reflecting the most recent CONAB survey.  The soybean crop in Canada is raised on higher expected area and yields.  The soybean crop in Russia is projected lower on the most recent harvest results.  Rapeseed production for Canada is projected at 18.5 million tons, up 0.5 million based on the most recent analysis from Statistics Canada.  Rapeseed production is also increased for Australia on higher expected yields.  Other oilseed production changes include higher sunflowerseed production for Turkey, higher cottonseed production for Australia, and lower cottonseed production for Brazil.  Malaysia palm oil production is reduced for 2015/16 based on final production data, and for 2016/17 with the impact of reduced rainfall continuing to affect yields.With increased global beginning stocks and production, 2016/17 oilseed supplies are projected 1 percent higher than last month.  With crush mostly unchanged, global oilseed stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 88.1 million tons, up 5.3 million mainly on higher soybean stocks in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and China.SUGAR:  The projection of beet sugar production from the 2016 sugarbeet crop is increased by 80,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) due to higher crop yields reported in the NASS October Crop Production that are only partially offset by reduced harvested area.  Fiscal year 2016/17 beet sugar production is further increased by 100,000 STRV and 2015/16 is reduced by the same amount due to slower-than-anticipated harvesting in Minnesota and North Dakota, shifting beet sugar production expected in September into the next fiscal year.  Beet sugar production for 2016/17 is therefore projected at 5.468 million STRV, an increase of 180,000 over last month.  Florida cane sugar production for 2016/17 is reduced 25,100 STRV based on reduced sugarcane harvested area forecast by NASS. Cane sugar production in Louisiana for 2015/16 is increased 15,542 STRV based on estimated production occurring in September, but is reduced in Hawaii by 10,000 based on a lower production pace-to-date than expected.  Imports for 2015/16 are reduced by 40,756 STRV.  The raw sugar tariff-rate quota shortfall is increased by 35,069 STRV to 125,057 based on full fiscal year data reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs).  Imports from calendar-year Free Trade Agreement quotas are reduced by 30,603 STRV for 2015/16 but with that portion totaling 26,656 attributable to Colombia now expected to enter in the first quarter of 2016/17.  Re-export imports are increased 20,916 STRV based on Customs reporting.  Imports from Mexico are increased by 3,000 STRV and high-tier tariff imports by 1,000.  Based on 2015/16 pace-to-date, deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 50,000 STRV to 11.950 million and deliveries of re-export import sugar for food product exports are increased by 20,000 to 150,000.  Deliveries for human consumption in 2016/17 are reduced by 30,000 STRV to 12.050 million in line with the downward adjustment for 2015/16.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.762 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.4 percent.Mexico exports to the United States for 2015/16 are increased 2,567 metric tons (MT) based on U.S. import data.  Production for 2016/17 is increased 200,000 MT to 6.300 million based on direct-source information gathered by USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service post in Mexico City.  The ending stock total for 2016/17 is unchanged at 1.248 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 421,396 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total red meat and poultry production for 2016 is reduced from last month as slightly higher beef and pork production is more than offset by lower broiler production.  No change is made to turkey production.  Beef production is raised on higher expected slaughter although carcass weights are reduced slightly.  Pork production for 2016 is raised on the pace of third quarter slaughter.  Broiler production is lowered as recent production data points towards continued slow growth in bird weights.  For 2017, the total red meat and poultry product forecast was raised, primarily due to higher pork production.  Beef production is raised based on expectations of higher first-quarter slaughter, but the broiler production forecast was lowered on more moderate growth in production continuing from 2016. The turkey production forecast was unchanged.  Egg production forecasts for 2016 or 2017 were raised on continued growth in table-egg laying flocks. Beef import and export forecasts for 2016 and 2017 were raised as slightly larger supplies of beef in a number of exporting countries support higher imports and lower U.S. beef prices make the United States more competitive in world markets.  The pork export forecast for 2017 is raised on expectations of higher sales to Asia.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts are unchanged for 2016 and 2017.Cattle, hog, broiler, and turkey prices for the last quarter of 2016 are reduced from last month as supplies of product are large.  For 2017, the continued large supplies of beef, pork, and broiler meat are expected to pressure prices through the year.  Egg prices are also reduced for both 2016 and 2017.The milk production forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised from last month as the cow inventory has grown more rapidly than previously expected.  The higher cow inventories appear to reflect growth in herds supplying expanding dairy product facilities.  Import forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised on higher expected imports of butter and several other dairy products.  Exports are forecast higher as increases in Oceania prices and relatively low U.S. prices are expected to make the United States more competitive in world markets.  Ending stocks are reduced as lower prices encourage increased demand from both export and domestic markets.Cheese and butter price forecasts for 2016 and 2017 have been lowered due to higher expected milk supplies.  However, nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey will likely benefit from increased competitiveness in export markets, and stronger exports will help support prices of those products.  Thus, price forecasts for NDM and whey are raised from last month.  Class III and Class IV prices are lowered from last month as lower cheese prices more than offset the higher whey price in the Class III calculation and the lower butter price outweighs the NDM price increase in the calculation of the Class IV price.  All milk prices are forecast lower at $15.80 to $15.90 per cwt for 2016 and $15.55 to $16.45 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  The 2016/17 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show marginally lower production, larger exports, and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced 108,000 bales, mainly in Texas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is raised to 12.0 million bales, due mainly to higher world import demand.  Ending stocks are now projected at 4.3 million bales.  The resulting stocks-to-use ratio of 28 percent is slightly below last season, but is still above the preceding six seasons.  The forecast range for the marketing year average farm price is 59.0 to 69.0 cents per pound; the midpoint of 64.0 cents per pound is 1 cent above last month\u2019s projection.The global cotton supply and demand forecasts for 2016/17 include sharply lower beginning and ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are reduced nearly 2.0 million bales, as consumption estimates for China are raised for 2014/15 and 2015/16.  The sale of more than 12 million bales from China\u2019s recently completed reserve auctions amid rising domestic prices suggests the China mill demand was previously underestimated.  Consumption is also raised for the previous two seasons in Bangladesh based on revised data (see http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/cotton.pdf  for more information).  World 2016/17 production is raised for Australia, partially offset by decreases for Brazil and the United States.  Consumption is raised for China and Bangladesh, but is reduced for Uzbekistan.  An increase of approximately 1.0 million bales in world trade mainly reflects higher imports for India and Bangladesh, and higher exports for Australia, the United States, and the African Franc Zone, partially offset by lower exports for Brazil.  World ending stocks are now projected at 87.3 million bales.",
    "January_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is estimated at 127.3 million tons, down 1.5 million from last month.  Lower soybean and peanut production is partly offset with higher canola, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed crops.  Soybean production is estimated at a record 4,307 million bushels, down 54 million from last month on lower yields.  Harvested area is estimated at 82.7 million acres, down 0.3 million from the previous forecast with lower planted area.  Yield is estimated at a record 52.1 bushels per acre, down 0.4 bushels.  Soybean supplies are down 60 million bushels on lower production and imports.  With exports and crush unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 420 million bushels, down 60 million from last month.  Although soybean crush is unchanged, soybean meal production is reduced on a lower extraction rate.  Soybean meal exports are also reduced on lagging sales.  Soybean oil balance sheet changes include increased production on a higher extraction rate, and increased ending stocks.U.S. peanut production is reduced 9 percent from the previous forecast based on lower harvested area, mainly in Texas, and lower yields in most states.  With reduced supplies, peanut exports, crush, and ending stocks are reduced.  The 2016/17 U.S. season-average farm price forecast for soybeans is projected at $9.00 to $10.00 per bushel, from $8.70 to $10.20, up 5 cents at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price forecast is unchanged at $305 to $345 per short ton.  The soybean oil price forecast of 34 to 37 cents per pound is lowered 0.5 cents at the midpoint.  The 2016/17 global oilseeds supply and demand estimates include higher production and exports compared to last month.  Oilseed production is projected up 0.1 million tons to 554.8 million on increases for cottonseed, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed partly offset by reductions for soybeans and peanuts.  Soybean production is lowered 0.2 million tons as increases for Brazil and China are offset by declines in Bolivia, Uruguay, and the United States.  The largest change to production is a 2.0-million-ton increase to 104.0 million for Brazil, where beneficial rain has resulted in improved yield prospects.  Global oilseed trade is projected at 160.3 million tons, up 0.4 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports for Brazil more than offset lower soybean exports for Bolivia and Uruguay and lower rapeseed exports for Canada.  Global oilseed crush is projected higher on increased soybean crush for Argentina and India and increased rapeseed crush for Canada.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 93.7 million tons, down 0.9 million, mainly on lower soybean stocks for the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. cane sugar production for 2016/17 is reduced by 29,236 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on industry reporting in Louisiana and Texas.  Total imports are reduced by 1,515 STRV based on end of calendar year adjustments made for tariff rate quota imports under several Free Trade Agreements.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.881 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 15.4 percent.Mexico sugar imports for 2015/16 are increased by 12,968 metric tons (MT) to 82,876 based on government data for the complete marketing year.  Total use is increased by the same 12,968 MT for deliveries for other uses.  Imports for 2016/17 are increased by 50,000 MT.  These are imports projected to enter from countries other than the United States and expected to be used for other deliveries.  The ending stock total for 2016/17 is unchanged at 1.229 million MT.  This is the amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic deliveries for human consumption and IMMEX deliveries for 2.5 months of the following marketing year and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of that same year.  Total exports for 2016/17 are unchanged at 1.470 million MT with the same 832,081 MT projected for the U.S. market as last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The estimate for total red meat and poultry production for 2016 is raised slightly from last month.  Beef production is raised on increased fed cattle slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Pork production for 2016 is raised based on slaughter data.  Broiler and turkey production for 2016 is slightly lower based on the recent slaughter.  For 2017, red meat and poultry production is raised largely on higher forecast pork production, although forecasts of beef and broilers are raised.  Higher expected cattle placements in late 2016 and early 2017 underpin higher forecast beef production in 2017.  USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report January 31 which will provide estimates of heifers held for breeding along with indications of the availability of cattle for placement during 2017.  Pork production for 2017 is raised based on estimates from the December Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report.  The 5 percent year-over-year increase in the September\u2013November pig crop will be slaughtered largely in the second quarter of 2017.  Producers indicated intentions to farrow 1 percent more sows in the first half of 2017 which, coupled with expected growth in pigs per litter, will support a higher level of slaughter during the second half of the year.  Broiler production is raised for early 2017 on recent hatchery data, but the turkey production forecast is unchanged.  Egg production for 2017 is raised slightly based on hatchery data. Both beef and pork 2016 export estimates are raised based on November trade data and expectations of strong export demand in December.  Beef imports are lowered, but no change is made to pork imports.  Broiler and turkey exports are lowered on recent trade data.  No change is made to the 2016 egg export estimate.  For 2017, beef exports are raised as current demand strength is expected to carry into 2017.  Imports are forecast higher on expectations of slightly larger supplies from Oceania in early 2017.  No changes are made to pork, broiler, or turkey trade forecasts. The 2017 egg export forecast is raised on expectations of stronger sales in the first half of the year. Livestock and poultry prices for 2016 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  The 2017 cattle price forecast is increased on continued strong demand into the first part of 2017.  The hog price forecast for first quarter 2017 is raised on demand strength, but price forecasts for subsequent quarters are lowered as hog supplies are expected to be large.  Broiler prices are raised slightly on early-year demand strength.  Turkey prices are forecast lower on relatively soft demand. Egg prices are increased.  Milk production for 2016 is raised on slightly larger milk cow numbers.  The 2017 milk production forecast is raised from last month as improved returns support increases in both cow numbers and milk per cow.  Fat and skim-solids basis exports for 2016 are raised on recent trade data.  Imports are unchanged.  Exports on a fat basis are reduced slightly for 2017, but are raised on a skim-solids basis.  Import forecasts are unchanged for 2017.Dairy product prices and Class prices for 2016 are adjusted to incorporate December price data.  For 2017, butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk, and whey prices are raised from last month on demand strength.  Class prices for 2017 are raised, reflecting higher product price forecasts.  The all milk price range is raised to $17.60 to $18.40 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2016/17 cotton outlook shows larger production, exports, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is raised 435,000 bales to nearly 17.0 million, due mainly to higher production in Texas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are raised to 12.5 million bales and ending stocks to 5.0 million.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers is narrowed 1 cent on each end to 65 to 69 cents per pound, with the midpoint unchanged at 67 cents.Larger production is the main factor driving a 1.5-million-bale increase in projected global 2016/17 ending stocks.  In addition to the increase for the United States, production is raised 1.0 million bales for China, where inspection data indicates higher production than previously anticipated for the Xinjiang region, partially offset by a decrease for Pakistan, which is based on ginning arrivals.  Consumption is reduced for India, Mexico, and Turkey, mostly offset by an increase for China.  World trade is raised slightly, due mainly to higher projected imports by Pakistan and Bangladesh.  Higher exports are projected for the United States and India, partially offset by decreases for Uzbekistan and Australia.  World ending stocks are now projected at 90.6 million bales.    ",
    "April_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2015/16 include higher exports, lower seed use, and lower ending stocks.  Soybean exports are increased 15 million bushels to 1,705 million reflecting stronger global soybean imports led by China and several other countries including Iran, Bangladesh, and Mexico.  Seed use is reduced slightly in line with plantings indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 445 million bushels, down 15 million from last month.  Soybean crush and balance sheets for soybean meal and oil are unchanged.  Forecast price ranges for soybeans and products are narrowed this month with midpoints all unchanged.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 527.0 million tons, marginally higher than last month, with small, mostly offsetting changes in foreign production.  Global soybean production is virtually unchanged at 320.2 million tons as a projected boost to Argentina production offsets a decline for India.  Argentina soybean production is projected at 59.0 million tons, up 0.5 million, as a higher forecast yield more than offsets a decline to harvested area.  India soybean production is lowered 0.5 million tons to 7.5 million on reduced harvested area and yield.  Yields are estimated at just 0.66 tons per hectare, reflecting excessive moisture in Madhya Pradesh and erratic rainfall in Maharashtra.  Other changes include reduced soybean production for China, and increased rapeseed production for the EU and China.  China sunflowerseed production is also raised, but more than offset by lower forecasts for the EU, Brazil, and Argentina.  For 2014/15, global soybean production is raised 1.0 million tons to 319.5 million on a larger estimate for Brazil.  Brazil 2014/15 soybean production is boosted as marketing year trade and crush data indicate a larger production estimate.  Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is projected at 150.8 million tons, up 1.4 million mainly reflecting increased soybean trade.  Increased exports projected for Brazil and the United States are only partly offset by reductions for Argentina and India.  Soybean imports are raised 1.0 million tons to 83.0 million for China reflecting stronger-than-expected imports from Brazil.  Higher soybean imports are projected for several other countries including Iran, Japan, Bangladesh, and Mexico.  Partly offsetting are soybean import reductions for Vietnam, Egypt, Venezuela, and Chile.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 79.0 million tons, up 0.2 million with gains for Argentina and China mostly offset with reductions for Brazil and the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar production for 2015/16 is decreased by 35,418 short tons, raw value (STRV) due to lower expected sucrose recovery from both sugarbeet slicing and from sugarcane milling in Florida.  Imports are increased by 8,646 STRV, mostly due to more calendar year 2016 shipments under Free Trade Agreements occurring in the fiscal year 2015/16 than originally anticipated.  Imports from Mexico are lowered slightly on the basis of a rounding adjustment. There are no use changes.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1.619 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.3 percent.Mexico sugar deliveries for 2015/16 human consumption are lowered by 25,241 metric tons (MT) to 4.319 million.  Exports are reduced slightly due to a rounding adjustment.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.160 million MT implying a stocks-to-consumption ratio of 26.85 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2016 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher expected cattle slaughter and heavier carcass weights more than offset a lower pork production forecast.  The Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released March 25, estimated that growth in pigs per litter in the first quarter was slower than expected and that producers expected to farrow fewer sows in March-May than previously intended. Coupled with slower-than-expected first quarter slaughter, forecast pork production is reduced.  No change is made to broiler and turkey production.  The beef import forecast is raised and the export is reduced from last month based on recent trade data.  The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to make the United States an attractive market for imports and constrains exports.  Pork imports are raised on the strength of the dollar, but improving demand in several importing countries is providing support for increased exports.  The broiler export forecast is unchanged from last month, but turkey exports are reduced on a slower pace of export recovery. The cattle price forecast is reduced from last month on relatively weak demand and larger expected fed cattle supplies.  Hog prices are lowered on weaker demand.  No change is made to 2016 broiler and turkey prices.  Egg prices are reduced on weaker demand.The milk production forecast is increased from last month on a slower reduction in the cow inventory and slightly faster growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis exports are raised on strong exports of butterfat-containing products, but strong imports of butterfat and cheese supported an increase in the fat basis import forecast.  Skim-solids exports and imports are lowered on the pace of trade to date. \u00a0The butter and nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecast are reduced from last month on relatively large supplies and continued pressure from weak international prices.  Cheese and whey prices are unchanged at the midpoint, but the range is narrowed for cheese.  With no change made to cheese and whey, the Class III price is unchanged at the midpoint. The Class IV price is lowered on lower butter and NDM prices.  The annual all milk price forecast is unchanged at the midpoint as stronger first-half prices are offset by lower second-half price forecasts.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton 2015/16 supply and demand forecasts show only marginal changes from last month.  Production is decreased 73,000 bales to reflect USDA\u2019s March Cotton Ginnings report.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged. With small adjustments to imports and the \u201cunaccounted\u201d residual, ending stocks are lowered 100,000 bales to 3.5 million.  The marketing year average price received by producers is expected to fall between 58.0 and 59.0 cents per pound, a reduction of 1.0 cent at the upper end of the range.The world cotton 2015/16 supply and demand forecasts include lower estimated beginning stocks and production combined with slightly higher consumption, resulting in a 1.1-million-bale reduction in ending stocks.  Beginning stocks are lowered about 300,000 bales, mainly for Greece and Malaysia on historical revisions, partly offset by an increase for Brazil.  World production is reduced 400,000 bales, with reductions in Cote d\u2019Iv\u01d2ire, Mali, and Brazil.  Consumption is raised for China and Pakistan, but is lowered for Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Turkey.  World stocks are now projected at 102.2 million bales. ",
    "August_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 96.2 million tons, down 4.7 million from last month mainly due to a lower soybean production forecast.  Soybean production for 2013/14 is forecast at 3.255 billion bushels, down 165 million due to lower harvested area and yields.  Harvested area is forecast at 76.4 million acres, down 0.5 million from the July projection.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 42.6 bushels per acre is 1.9 bushels below last month\u2019s projection but 3 bushels above last year\u2019s drought-reduced yield.  Soybean supplies for 2013/14 are projected 5 percent below last month based on the lower production forecast.  With reduced supplies and higher prices, U.S. soybean exports are reduced 65 million bushels to 1.385 billion.  Lower U.S. exports will be mostly offset by increases for South America, especially Argentina.  Soybean crush is also lowered as higher prices reduce prospective exports for soybean meal.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 220 million bushels, down 75 million from last month.U.S. soybean balance sheet changes for 2012/13 include increased imports, reduced exports, and increased crush.  Imports are raised 10 million bushels to 35 million based on strong shipments from South America.  Exports are reduced 15 million to 1.315 billion bushels reflecting exceptionally low shipments in recent weeks and revised export data for September through December 2012 from the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Crush is increased 25 million bushels to 1.685 billion to account for increased soybean meal exports.  Soybean ending stocks are unchanged at 125 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2013/14 is forecast at $10.35 to $12.35 per bushel, up 60 cents on both ends.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $305 to $345, up 15 dollars at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 44 to 48 cents per pound, down 3 cents at the midpoint reflecting the sharp drop in futures contract prices in the past month.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 493.1 million tons, up 0.2 million tons from last month.  Reductions for soybeans and cottonseed are offset by increases for rapeseed, sunflowerseed, peanuts, and palm kernel production.  Lower soybean production projected for the United States is partly offset by an increase for India where higher harvested area more than offsets reduced yields caused by excessive July rainfall.  Rapeseed production is raised in several countries including Canada and the European Union, where abundant moisture and favorable temperatures in July helped to boost yield prospects.  Rapeseed production forecasts are also raised for China and Ukraine.  Sunflowerseed production is also raised for the European Union and Ukraine.  Global peanut production is raised this month reflecting updated historical data and forecasts for several countries in Africa.  Cottonseed changes include reduced production for China and the United States and an increase for Pakistan.Reduced global soybean production is only partly offset by lower crush leaving 2013/14 global soybean ending stocks down 1.9 million tons at 72.3 million.  Global soybean stocks remain record high despite this month\u2019s reduction.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is increased slightly from last month, as higher beginning stocks and imports are nearly offset by lower production.  The decline in production is due to lower forecast sugarbeet and sugarcane yields, compared with last month\u2019s trend-based projections.  For Mexico, higher supplies are due to increased production more than offsetting lower carryin stocks.  Harvest area of sugarcane is higher than initially projected, but slightly lower than Mexico\u2019s final estimate for 2012/13.  With 2013/14 supplies up in Mexico, exports to the United States are increased.  Ending stocks are raised slightly for both Mexico and the United States.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2013 is raised from last month as higher beef production more than offsets lower pork, broiler, and turkey production.  Beef production is raised as greater fed cattle and cow slaughter combine with heavier average carcass weights to push output higher.  Moderate feed prices and recent placement of heavy animals are expected to support higher average carcass weights in the second half of the year.  Pork production is reduced largely reflecting lower slaughter in the third quarter.  Broiler production is reduced as the increase in second-quarter production was smaller than expected.  The forecast for second-half production is unchanged.  Turkey production is lowered as hatchery data portends sharper production declines in the third and fourth quarters.  Egg production is raised from last month as greater table egg production more than offsets a marginal decline in second quarter hatching egg production.  For 2014, beef production is raised slightly on larger expected marketings of cattle placed in 2013.  Forecasts for other meats are unchanged.  Egg production is higher compared to last month as growth in the broiler breeder flock is expected to support greater hatching egg production. Beef exports are raised for 2013 on stronger shipments to several markets, while the forecast for 2014 is unchanged from last month.  Beef imports for 2013 are reduced based on second-quarter data, but are unchanged for 2014.  The 2013 pork export forecast is down fractionally reflecting second-quarter data, with 2014 unchanged.  The 2013 broiler export forecast is higher as shipments showed continued strength in June.  The forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Turkey exports for 2013 are up slightly reflecting trade data for the second quarter.  U.S. Census Bureau revisions are reflected in historical trade estimates.Fed cattle prices are reduced in 2013 and 2014 as greater beef production and attractively priced competing meats are expected to pressure prices.  Hog prices are raised for 2013 as demand strength is expected to continue through the end of the year.  Broiler prices are reduced in 2013 and 2014 as recent price declines are expected to persist.  Turkey price forecasts are unchanged from last month.   The 2013 milk production forecast is higher than last month based on production data for the second quarter, but subsequent quarters are unchanged.  Production for 2014 is unchanged.  Exports are raised for 2013 on both a fat and skim-solids basis as continued tight world supplies support higher exports.  However, the export forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Fat basis imports are raised for 2013 while the skim solid forecast is lower.  Import forecasts for 2014 are unchanged.Fat-basis ending stock forecasts for 2013 and 2014 are lowered as lower prices are expected to support greater butter use.  The skim-basis stock forecast is unchanged for 2013 but lowered for 2014 as domestic demand for nonfat dry milk (NDM) is expected to improve. Robust demand for NDM supports increased price forecasts for 2013 and 2014.  The cheese price forecast for 2013 is raised on relatively strong demand, but the forecast is unchanged for 2014.  Butter prices are forecast lower for both 2013 and 2014 as stocks are relatively high.  The whey price forecast is unchanged from last month.  For 2013, the Class III price is raised from last month on the stronger cheese price, but the 2014 price is reduced on a lower butterfat price.  The range of the 2013 Class IV price is narrowed for 2013 but is unchanged at the midpoint as the lower butter price is largely offset by the higher NDM price.  The 2014 Class IV price is unchanged.  The all milk price for 2013 is forecast at $19.60 to $19.80 per cwt and $18.65 to $19.65 per cwt for 2014.COTTON:  This month\u2019s U.S. cotton estimates for 2013/14 reflect lower production as indicated by USDA\u2019s first crop survey, resulting in lower ending stocks.  Production is reduced 447,000 bales to 13.1 million, the smallest since 2009.  The abandonment rate is estimated virtually the same as last season, but yields are down, due mainly to a 17-percent reduction in the Southeast from the 2012 record.  Relative to last month, the 2013/14 balance sheet also includes marginally lower beginning stocks and a decrease of 400,000 bales in the export projection.  Domestic mill use is unchanged.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 2.8 million bales, the equivalent of 20 percent of total disappearance.  The forecast range of 72 to 88 cents for the marketing-year average price received by producers is narrowed 2 cents on each end.The U.S. 2012/13 balance sheet is revised this month to reflect exports as reported in USDA\u2019s U.S. Export Sales end-of-season report, and also includes a first estimate of final ending stocks.  Stocks in public warehouses as of July 27, 2013, as reported to the Farm Service Agency, are lower than anticipated, resulting in a preliminary loss estimate of 325,000 bales.The 2013/14 world cotton forecasts show higher beginning stocks, lower production, and marginally lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced for China, the United States, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe, but is raised for Pakistan.  The China crop estimate reflects unfavorable weather in parts of Xinjiang, north central China, and in Hunan province.  Other major foreign changes to the world balance sheet are concentrated in India.  India\u2019s production is unchanged from last month, but stocks are raised in 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14 due to adjustments to the residual \u201closs,\u201d as the official data used to estimate production, trade, and consumption indicate unsustainably low stock levels.  India\u2019s exports are raised in both 2012/13 and 2013/14.",

    "March_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2014/15 are unchanged this month. With soybean crush and exports projected at 1,795 million bushels and 1,790 million bushels respectively, ending stocks remain projected at an 8-year high of 385 million bushels.  Soybean and soybean product prices are also unchanged.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2014/15 is projected at $9.45 to $10.95 per bushel; soybean meal and soybean oil prices are projected at $350 to $390 per short ton and 30 to 34 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 532.2 million tons, up fractionally from last month on small changes in foreign production.  Global soybean production is unchanged at a record 315.1 million tons with Brazil soybean production projected at 94.5 million tons, Argentina at 56.0 million, and Paraguay at 8.5 million.  Small changes in other oilseeds include increased rapeseed production for Australia, lower sunflowerseed production for India, and higher cottonseed production for Pakistan.Global oilseed trade for 2014/15 is projected at 136.8 million tons, up 0.3 million mainly reflecting increased soybean exports for Paraguay and India.  Soybean imports are raised for several countries including Russia, Turkey, Mexico, and Bangladesh.  Lower soybean imports for Brazil and Iran partly offset these gains.  Oilseed product trade changes include reduced soybean meal exports for India and reduced soybean meal imports for Turkey, the Philippines, Japan, and Venezuela.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 103.3 million tons, up fractionally from last month.SUGAR:  Mexico 2014/15 sugar imports are reduced by 18,186 metric tons (MT) due to fewer imports from the United States for Mexico sugar-containing product export program (IMMEX).  The new import level is equal to 173,678 MT.  With no change either to beginning stocks or to production, total supply is reduced by the same amount as imports.  Mexico 2014/15 exports are reduced by 65,068 MT to 1.631 million.  Exports are split between 1.306 million MT projected to go to the United States and 325,000 to other countries.  Exports to the United States are projected under the terms of the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico, dated December 19, 2014 \u2013 specifically the \u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Needs\u201d defined within the Agreement.  There are no changes to deliveries, and ending stocks are calculated residually at 1.001 million MT, 46,882 MT more than last month.Florida 2014/15 cane sugar production is increased 35,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on the sugarcane production estimates reported by the NASS in the March 10, 2015, Crop Production and on trend sugar per acre.  Sugar imports expected from Mexico are reduced by 76,029 STRV to 1,525,911.  There are no other changes to components of U.S sugar supply.U.S. sugar exports for 2014/15 are reduced by 25,000 STRV, based on pace-to-date analysis. There are no changes to 2014/15 deliveries.  Ending stocks are calculated residually at 1.650 million STRV, a decrease from last month of 16,029.  The implied stocks-to-use ratio is 13.5 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2015 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower beef production more than offsets increases in pork and broiler production.  Fed cattle slaughter is expected to be lower in the first-quarter, but cow slaughter remains higher than expected.  In addition, carcass weights are reduced slightly in the first quarter.  Pork production is increased on higher first quarter slaughter and slightly heavier carcass weights.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on March 27 which will provide an indication of producers\u2019 expectations to farrow sows through the third quarter.  Broiler production is higher as hatchery data shows continued growth in chicks placed.  Turkey and egg production is unchanged from last month. The 2015 beef import forecast is higher than last month as demand for processing grade beef remains strong and strength of the dollar makes the United States an attractive market.  Beef exports for 2015 are reduced due to relatively high U.S. prices and the strong dollar.  Pork exports are lowered based on lower-than-expected shipments in January.  Pork imports are raised as the strong dollar makes the United States an attractive market despite large supplies of domestic pork.  The broiler export forecast is lowered as the strong dollar crimps demand.  Turkey exports are also reduced.  The egg export forecast is raised. The 2015 cattle price is unchanged.  The hog price forecast is reduced as greater production and lower exports imply greater supplies for the domestic market.  Broiler prices are lowered on weaker demand and larger supplies of product.  Turkey prices are unchanged.  The egg price is raised on stronger first quarter demand. The milk production forecast for 2015 is lowered from last month as slower growth in output per cow more than offsets faster herd expansion.  Both fat and skim-solids exports for 2015 are reduced as export demand is hampered by a strong dollar and increased competition from other exporters.  Fat basis imports are higher on expectations of greater butterfat imports.  However, robust domestic demand is expected to support increased product use.\u00a0Product price forecasts for butter and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are higher, supported by demand and price strength to date.  Cheese prices are unchanged at the midpoint but the range is narrowed.  Whey is lower on weaker demand.  The Class III price is lowered on reduced whey prices.  The Class IV price is higher due to higher NDM prices and butter prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.05 to $17.65 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2014/15 cotton supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 59.0 to 62.0 cents per pound is lowered 1 cent on the upper end, with the midpoint estimated at 60.5 cents per pound.Marginal reductions in 2014/15 world cotton production and consumption are boosting projected global stocks to just over 110 million bales.  Production is raised for Pakistan, but is lowered for Tajikistan and others.  Consumption is reduced mainly for China, where yarn imports continue to rise, displacing growth in domestic cotton spinning.  Lower consumption by China is partially offset by increases for Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam.  World trade is raised slightly.",
    "March_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2013/14 include higher imports and exports, reduced crush, and reduced ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s report.  Soybean exports are raised 20 million bushels to a record 1.53 billion reflecting continued strong sales and shipments through February.  Soybean crush is reduced 10 million bushels to 1.69 billion reflecting weaker-than-expected domestic soybean meal use through the first quarter of the marketing year.  Soybean stocks are projected at 145 million bushels, down 5 million from last month.  Soybean oil stocks are reduced on lower production and increased exports.  Other soybean oil changes include reduced use for biodiesel and an offsetting increase for food, feed, and other industrial use.Soybean and soybean product prices are all projected higher this month.  The season-average price range forecast for soybeans is raised 25 cents on both ends of the range to $12.20 to $13.70 per bushel.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 36 to 39 cents per pound, up 1.5 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $450 to $490 per short ton, up 25 dollars at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 504.3 million tons, down 1.7 million from last month as reduced soybean and copra production are only partly offset by increases for rapeseed, sunflowerseed, and peanuts.  Foreign production, projected at 407.0 million tons, accounts for all of the change.  Brazil soybean production is projected at 88.5 million tons, down 1.5 million mainly reflecting hot, dry weather in the south when much of the crop was in the flowering and filling stages.  Soybean production is also reduced for Paraguay due to the extended period of hot, dry weather.  China rapeseed production is estimated at 14.4 million tons, up 0.2 million based on increased area and yield indicated in recently released government statistics.  Other changes include higher rapeseed production for Australia and increased peanut production for China, Uganda, and Tanzania.Global oilseed supplies, exports, and ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected lower this month while crush is projected higher.  Soybean crush is projected higher for the European Union, Paraguay, and Zambia; rapeseed and peanut crush are each raised for China.  Lower soybean stocks in the United States, Brazil, and Paraguay are only partly offset by higher rapeseed stocks in China.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 84.0 million tons, down 1.9 million.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 7,000 short tons, raw value (STRV), from last month, as lower production more than offsets higher beginning stocks.  Forecast use is increased 135,000 STRV.  Higher expected domestic deliveries for food use are based on the pace to date.  A larger forecast for exports of refined sugar under the re-export program is the result of shipments so far in 2013/14.  The net reduction in ending stocks of 142,000 STRV brings the stocks-to-use ratio down to 13.6 percent, from 14.9 percent projected in February.Supply and use estimates for Mexico for 2012/13 and forecasts for 2013/14 are unchanged this month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2014 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as higher beef production is more than offset by lower pork, broiler, and turkey production.  For beef, continued relatively large cattle placements in the first quarter are expected to result in higher slaughter in 2014.  Coupled with heavier carcass weights and higher expected first-quarter cow slaughter, the beef production forecast is raised.  Pork production is reduced from last month as higher carcass weights are insufficient to offset tighter supplies of hogs.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on March 28.  Broiler production is lowered as hatchery data points to slower growth in eggs set and chicks placed.  Turkey production is reduced as January slaughter and hatchery data were below expectations.  Egg production forecasts for 2014 are unchanged, but historical data are adjusted to reflect recently published data. The beef import forecast for 2014 is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is raised on strong sales to Asian markets.  Pork imports are raised as prices are forecast higher, but the export forecast is reduced as high prices are expected to constrain sales.  The broiler export forecast is raised as January exports were higher-than-expected.  Turkey exports are lowered.  The egg export forecast is unchanged. Cattle prices for 2014 are raised from last month, reflecting tight supplies and continued price strength for fed cattle.  The hog price forecast is raised on expected tight supplies of market hogs and strong demand.  Broiler and turkey prices are largely unchanged but the egg price is raised on higher first-quarter prices. The milk production forecast for 2014 is unchanged from last month, but historical data are adjusted to reflect revised data for 2012 and 2013.  Fat-basis exports for 2014 are raised on higher sales of cheese and butter.  Skim-solid exports are unchanged as lower lactose and weaker-than-expected early year sales of nonfat dry milk (NDM) offset gains in cheese.  Fat-basis imports are unchanged.  Skim-solid imports are raised on strong demand for milk protein concentrates.  \u00a0Product price forecasts for cheese, butter, NDM, and whey are higher, supported by strong demand and price strength to date.  Class III and Class IV prices are raised on higher product prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $21.40 to $22.00 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2013/14 cotton estimates include slightly higher exports and lower ending stocks.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged from last month.  The export forecast is raised to 10.7 million bales based on strong activity in recent weeks.  Ending stocks are reduced to 2.8 million bales, resulting in a stocks-to-use ratio of 20 percent.  The range for the marketing-year average price received by producers is raised 1 cent per pound on the lower end to 75 to 78 cents, with a midpoint of 76.5 cents.The global cotton supply and demand estimates for 2013/14 show slightly lower consumption and higher ending stocks.  The world production forecast is virtually unchanged.  Decreases in consumption for China and Pakistan are partially offset by increases for India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and others.  China\u2019s consumption is lowered 500,000 bales based on increasing concentrations of domestic supply in the national reserve and continued growth in cotton yarn imports.  Pakistan\u2019s consumption also is lowered 500,000 bales, as sluggish imports indicate lower use.  World ending stocks are now forecast at 96.8 million bales. ",
    "December_2019": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is forecast at 107.6 million tons, down slightly due to a decrease for cottonseed.  Soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 are unchanged from last month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $8.85 per bushel, down 15 cents.  The soybean meal price forecast is reduced $15.00 to $310.00 per short ton.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 31.0 cents per pound.Global 2019/20 oilseed production is forecast up 3.3 million tons to 574.6 million, with greater soybean, sunflowerseed, and peanut production partly offset with lower rapeseed and cottonseed forecasts.  China\u2019s soybean production is projected up 1.0 million tons to 18.1 million reflecting higher area and yield reported by the National Bureau of Statistics.  Sunflowerseed production is forecast higher for Russia and Ukraine.  Sunflower yields for both Ukraine and Russia established new record highs based on a continuing strong upward yield trend, seasonably cool temperatures, and timely mid-summer rainfall.  Other changes include increased peanut production for India, lower rapeseed production for Canada, higher cottonseed production for Brazil, and lower cottonseed production for Pakistan. Global 2019/20 soybean exports are reduced 0.6 million tons to 149.0 million on a lower forecast for Argentina.  Soybean imports are reduced for Vietnam, offset by higher soybean meal imports.  Global soybean stocks are forecast higher this month on increases for China and Brazil.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 4.367 million short tons, raw value (STRV), a reduction of 220,625 from last month.  Yield and area harvested forecasts from last month\u2019s NASS Crop Production report are adjusted down on processors\u2019 updated forecasts in the latest Sweetener Market Data.  Beet pile shrink is forecast at a relatively low 4 percent due to the shortened slice campaign.  Sucrose recovery is unchanged from last month.  Cane sugar production for 2019/20 is reduced by 110,760 STRV with reductions in Florida and Texas based on downward revisions made by processors.  Louisiana production is reduced 82,055 STRV to 1.712 million based on lower sugarcane production reported by NASS and lower sucrose recovery forecast by processors.  Minor adjustments to forecasted TRQ imports are made based on a small increase in the raw sugar TRQ shortfall, partially offset by an increase in FTA imports.  Sugar imports from Mexico are increased by 708,875 STRV to 1.827 million.  With no changes made to use, ending stocks are forecast at 1.655 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.50 percent. Mexico exports to the United States are projected to increase 606,680 metric tons, actual weight (MT) to 1.563 million on projected U.S. Needs implied in the U.S. sugar supply and use for 2019/20 in this December 2019 WASDE.

According to estimates from CONADESUCA, Mexico has exported 30,043 MT of this amount through November 30.Mexico exports to the United States are projected to increase 606,680 metric tons, actual weight (MT) to 1.563 million on projected U.S. Needs implied in the U.S. sugar supply and use for 2019/20 in this December 2019 WASDE.  Exports to other destinations are projected at 40,043 MT.  According to estimates from CONADESUCA, Mexico has exported 30,043 MT of this amount through November 30.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2019 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month on the current pace of beef, pork, and broiler production.  Egg production is raised on higher table and hatching egg production.For 2020, the total red meat and poultry forecast is increased from last month as higher broiler production more than offsets a lower beef production forecast.  Recent hatchery data, lower feed costs, and expected gains in exports will likely support a more rapid pace of expansion during the year.  Beef production is reduced on slightly slower pace of both fed and nonfed cattle slaughter in the first half of the year.  The pork and turkey production forecasts are unchanged.  USDA will publish the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on December 23 which will provide an indication of producer farrowing plans for first-half 2020.  The 2020 egg production forecast is raised from the previous month.Beef imports for 2019 and 2020 are raised from last month on trade data to date and expectations that demand for processing-grade beef will remain strong.  Exports for 2020 are lowered to reflect a slightly weaker pace of sales; the forecast for 2020 is unchanged.  Pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are lowered to reflect slower-than-previously expected growth in exports to several markets although the recent trade agreement with Japan is expected to mitigate the decline in total exports.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is unchanged from last month, but turkey exports are increased slightly.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts for 2020 are increased on the recent announcement by China that it is reopening its market to U.S. poultry meat.  The cattle price forecast is raised for fourth-quarter 2019 based on recent data and the strength is expected to carry into 2020.  The 2019 and 2020 hog price forecasts are reduced on current price weakness.  The 2019 broiler price forecast is unchanged from last month, but increased production in 2020 is expected to pressure prices.  The 2019 turkey price is raised, but the 2020 price forecast is unchanged.  The egg price forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are increased on recent price strength.The milk production forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are unchanged from the previous month.  The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are lowered largely on lower expected imports of butterfat products.  The fat basis export forecast for 2019 is unchanged, but 2020 is raised on higher exports of butterfat products.  Skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are unchanged.  Skim-solids basis exports are raised on larger shipments of nonfat dry milk/skim milk powder. Cheese and butter price forecasts for 2019 are lowered, but the nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is raised.  The whey price is unchanged.  For 2020, the butter price is reduced on continued demand softness, but cheese prices are forecast slightly higher on stronger demand.  NDM and whey prices are raised, supported by higher expected export demand.  The 2019 Class III price forecasts is lowered on the weaker cheese price; the Class IV price is unchanged from last month as the lower butter price is offset by a higher NDM price.  The 2020 forecast of both Class III and Class IV are raised on gains in most product prices with the exception of butter.  The 2019 all milk price forecast is unchanged at $18.60 per cwt; the 2020 all milk price is raised to $19.40 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s outlook for U.S. cotton in 2019/20 includes lower production and ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is lowered 611,000 bales mainly due to a 500,000-bale decline in Texas.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  Ending stocks are 600,000 bales lower this month, at 5.5 million.  Upland cotton\u2019s season-average farm price is also unchanged at 61 cents per pound.The global 2019/20 cotton forecasts include lower beginning stocks and production, largely offset by lower consumption.  A nearly 900,000-bale decline this month in beginning stocks is led by a 700,000-bale reduction in India, following a report by India\u2019s Cotton Advisory Board that lowered India\u2019s 2018/19 cotton crop by a similar amount.  World cotton production in 2019/20 is projected at 121.1 million bales, down 830,000 from November, and 3.0 million higher than in 2018/19.  Production changes for 2019/20 this month other than the United States include decreases of 800,000 bales for Pakistan, 500,000 for India, and smaller declines for Australia, Turkey, and Chad.  Partly offsetting are a 900,000-bale increase in Brazil\u2019s projected crop, a 500,000-bale increase for Uzbekistan, and several smaller gains.  A 1.2-million-bale decline this month in projected world consumption is led by a 1.0-million-bale reduction for China, due in part to lower textile exports.  The consumption forecasts for Vietnam and Pakistan were also reduced, offsetting a small increase for Uzbekistan. Global 2019/20 ending stocks are nearly 500,000 bales lower this month.  At 80.3 million bales, total ending stocks are only projected about 600,000 bales higher than in 2018/19, but stocks outside of China are expected to rise 3.1 million bales from the year before.",
    "February_2022": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s 2021/22 U.S. soybean outlook is for increased soybean crush and lower ending stocks.  Soybean crush is forecast at 2.215 billion bushels, up 25 million from last month on favorable crush margins and improving prospects for soybean meal exports.  Soybean meal exports are reduced for Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay as drought-reduced crops limit crush prospects.  With soybean exports unchanged, ending stocks are reduced 25 million bushels to 325 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2021/22 is forecast at $13.00 per bushel, up 40 cents from last month partly reflecting the impact of drought in South America.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $410.00 per short ton, up 35 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is raised 1 cent to 66.0 cents per pound.Global 2021/22 soybean supply and demand forecasts include lower production, crush, exports, and stocks.  Global soybean production is reduced 8.7 million tons to 363.9 million on drought in South America.  Brazil\u2019s soybean crop is lowered 5 million tons to 134 million, Paraguay is lowered 2.2 million to 6.3 million, and Argentina is reduced 1.5 million to 45 million.  Exports and crush are lowered in all three countries.  Lower supplies and higher prices reduce global meal demand, particularly for China where soybean crush and imports are lowered 3 million tons to 94 and 97 million, respectively.  Global soybean ending stocks are reduced 2.4 million tons to 92.8 million.  Another notable oilseed change includes a 1.3-million-ton increase to 10.8 million for Indian rapeseed production on a faster-than-expected planting pace and higher yields.SUGAR:  The U.S. sugar supply for 2021/22 is increased 45,434 short tons, raw value (STRV) as an increase in cane sugar production is only minimally offset by a reduction in imports.  Louisiana cane sugar production for 2021/22 is increased by 49,170 STRV to 1,905,741 on industry reporting.  The sugarcane harvest ran longer through January than normal and the crop had strong sucrose content.  Raw sugar imports entering under the 2020/21 TRQ that had been extended to December 31 are adjusted down 3,736 STRV by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  There is no change to sugar use this month.  Ending stocks are increased by the amount of increased supply to 1,818,472 STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.74 percent.There are only small changes for the 2021/22 Mexico supply and use.  Imports for consumption are reduced by 9,000 metric tons (MT) due to lower domestic prices.  Deliveries to the IMMEX program are increased by 11,057 MT to 497,000 on greater pace-to-date deliveries.  Ending stocks are up slightly and residually determined exports, other than those to the United States under the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements, are reduced by 22,360 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Estimates of 2021 red meat, poultry, and egg production are adjusted to reflect December production data.  The 2022 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is lowered slightly from last month, as higher forecast beef production is more than offset by lower pork, broiler, and turkey production.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month as larger expected placements during first-half 2022 are marketed in the latter half of the year.  However, the increase in fed cattle slaughter is partly offset by lower non-fed cattle slaughter.  Pork production is lowered on a slower pace of slaughter.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced on current hatchery data and higher expected feed costs.  The egg production forecast is reduced from last month as higher feed costs are expected to temper production growth.  Livestock, poultry, and egg trade estimates for 2021 are adjusted to reflect December trade data.  For 2022, the beef import forecast is raised on strong demand for processing beef; the export forecast is unchanged.  Pork exports are reduced on continued weakness in demand from China and increased competition in other markets.  The broiler export forecast is lowered on weaker demand from a number of Asian markets.  The turkey export forecast is reduced from last month on slower demand.  Fed-cattle prices are raised for the second half of the year on firm packer demand.  Hog, broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised on current prices and slower growth of production expected during the year.  Egg prices are also raised on current prices and slower production growth.  The 2021 milk production, trade, and stock estimates are adjusted to reflect December data.  For 2022, the milk production forecast is lowered from last month, on lower dairy cow numbers.  The Cattle report estimated the dairy cow inventory on January 1 almost one percent below 2021, and the number of heifers held for dairy cow replacement was 3 percent lower.  The 2022 fat basis import forecast is raised on higher expected imports of butter, while exports are reduced on lower expected shipments of butter and cheese.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is raised, reflecting higher imports of milk proteins and several other dairy-containing products while the export forecast is reduced on weaker expected sales of whey products and skim milk powder.  Annual product price forecasts for cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey are raised from the previous month on current prices, lower expected milk production, and tightening stocks.  With higher product prices, both the Class III and the Class IV prices are raised.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is increased to $23.55 per cwt. COTTON:  The 2021/22 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show slightly lower exports and higher ending stocks relative to last month, while production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  The export forecast is lowered 250,000 bales to 14.75 million based on lagging shipments due to logistical issues.  The upland cotton marketing year average price received by producers is projected at 90 cents per pound, unchanged from January.World 2021/22 cotton ending stocks are 700,000 bales lower this month, largely a result of an 800,000-bale drop in production.  India\u2019s crop is reduced 500,000 bales as a slow pace for market arrivals indicates weaker than expected yields, and Tanzania\u2019s crop is 345,000 bales lower based on updated government data on planted area.  World beginning stocks for 2021/22 are 240,000 bales higher as several years of historical revisions for Iran and Syria raise global beginning stocks and consumption slightly.  Projected consumption is nearly 200,000 bales higher this month.  World trade is 120,000 bales lower as China\u2019s imports are reduced 250,000 bales, partly offset by an increase for India\u2019s imports.  Falling U.S., Brazilian, and Indian exports are partly offset by a higher export forecast for Australia.",
    "April_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2016/17 include higher seed use, reduced residual disappearance, and higher ending stocks.  Seed use is raised in line with the record plantings indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report, and residual use is reduced based on indications from the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  With exports and crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks are projected at 445 million bushels, up 10 million from last month.  Soybean meal balance sheet changes include increased exports and lower domestic use.  Soybean oil changes include reduced food, feed, and other industrial use, as well as, increased ending stocks.Projected prices for soybeans and products are reduced this month.  The season-average soybean price is lowered 5 cents at the midpoint to $9.55 per bushel based on marketings to date and lower expected prices for the second half of the marketing year.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 31 to 33 cents per pound, down 1.5 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $310 to $330 per short ton, down $5.00 at the midpoint.The 2016/17 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts show higher production, exports, crush, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is raised 5.4 million tons to 563.4 million mainly on a combined 5.0-million-ton increase in soybean production for Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.  As a result, forecasted global soybean exports are increased 2.2 million tons to 143.3 million.  Corresponding to higher exports, soybean imports are raised for China and the EU.  Higher soybean production has also led to a 0.4-million-ton increase in global forecasted crush and a 4.6-million-ton increase in soybean stocks.  Global soybean stocks are projected at a record 87.4 million tons, 10.3 million above a year earlier.  Soybean meal production is raised 0.3 million tons aligned with higher projected crush, but with lower domestic use and import demand, soybean meal stocks are increased 0.9 million tons.SUGAR:  U.S. fiscal year 2016/17 beet sugar production is decreased 110,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.996 million.  Sucrose recovery from sugarbeet slicing, reported by processors in the Sweetener Market Data (SMD) report for the period covering August 2016 and February 2017 of this year\u2019s sugarbeet harvest cycle, imply a final crop year recovery projection from slicing at 13.8 percent, slightly below last month\u2019s 13.9 percent.  In addition, the projected slicing of sugarbeets stored in piles is reduced on the basis of a 20 percent increase in shrink, or the percentage loss of piled beets estimated by beet processors.  The new shrink factor is 7.0 percent, up from last month\u2019s 5.8 percent.  Sugarcane production for 2016/17 is reduced by 24,871 STRV mainly on the basis of reduced sucrose recovery expected by processors in Florida and Texas.  Re-export imports for 2016/17 are increased by 150,000 STRV to 375,000, based on a survey of license holders\u2019 intentions.  Sugar exports are expected to increase 50,000 STRV to 125,000.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 1.642 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.3 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2016/17 is decreased 184,677 metric tons (MT) to 6.186 million in agreement with the new estimate made by the Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (CONADESUCA) in Mexico.  Deliveries for human consumption are likewise increased by 72,627 MT to 4.461 million and imports for consumption are increased by 15,000 MT to 25,000.  These changes reflect adjustments based on observed production, deliveries, and imports made through the end of February.  The ending stock forecast for 2016/17 is increased by 15,391 at 1.293 million MT, an amount projected by USDA to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Although exports to the United States for 2016/17 are unchanged at 994,502 MT, total exports are reduced by 257,435 as residually determined shipments to third-countries are lowered.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2017 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher beef and turkey production more than offset modest reductions in pork production.  Beef production is forecast higher on the current pace of slaughter and heavier-than-expected cattle weights in the first half of the year.  The pork production forecast is lowered slightly with second and third-quarter production reduced but almost offset by higher fourth-quarter production.  The March Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that industry expansion is still underway although producers intend to slow farrowings this summer.  Turkey production is forecast higher on recent hatchery data.  The egg production forecast is reduced slightly on lower hatching egg production.  The broiler production forecast is unchanged.  The beef import forecast for 2017 is raised as higher expected beef supplies from Oceania in the latter half of the year outweigh declines in the first half.  No changes are made to beef exports.  The first quarter turkey export forecast is reduced slightly from last month.  The egg export forecast is reduced slightly on the pace of first-quarter trade.  Pork and broiler trade forecasts for 2017 are unchanged.The cattle and hog price estimates for the first quarter reflect March price data, but the forecasts for the outlying quarters are unchanged.  Broiler price forecasts are raised as current prices remain strong.  Turkey and egg prices are adjusted to reflect March data; forecasts for the outlying quarters are unchanged.  The milk production forecast for 2017 is lowered as reductions in milk per cow offset increases in milk cow numbers.  Fat basis imports are reduced on weaker imports of cheese and butterfat products, but imports of milk protein products support a higher skim-solids basis import forecast.  Fat basis exports are lowered on weaker sales of whole milk powder (WMP), but skim-solids basis exports are raised as weaker WMP is more than offset by higher sales of a number of skim-based products.  Ending stock forecasts are raised on both a fat and skim-solids basis, reflecting current large supplies and lower expected domestic use.Dairy products price forecasts for cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey are lowered as both domestic and international supplies are large.  As a result both Class III and Class IV price forecasts are reduced from last month.  The all milk price for 2017 is lowered to $17.40-$17.90 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2016/17 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged. The export forecast is raised 800,000 bales to 14.0 million, based on strong export sales during March.  This would be the fourth-largest volume ever for U.S. exports, accounting for nearly 40 percent of world trade.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 3.7 million bales, equivalent to 21 percent of total disappearance. The marketing year price received by producers is projected to average between 67 and 69 cents per pound, a reduction of 1 cent at the upper end of the range.The 2016/17 world cotton forecasts include higher production and ending stocks.  Higher production estimates for China and Brazil are only partly offset by a slightly smaller crop in Australia. Lower expected exports for India, Australia, and Uzbekistan largely offset increases for the United States, Brazil, and Greece.  World ending stocks are now projected at 90.9 million bales, about 400,000 bales higher than forecast a month earlier.",
    "January_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is estimated at 116.2 million tons, down 1.5 million from last month.  Smaller crops for soybeans, canola, and cottonseed are only partly offset by increases for sunflowerseed and peanuts.  Soybean production is estimated at 3,930 million bushels, down 51 million on lower harvested area and yields.  Harvested area is estimated at 81.8 million acres, down 0.6 million from the previous forecast.  Yield is estimated at 48.0 bushels per acre, down 0.3 bushels, but still a record.  With lower supplies, exports are reduced 25 million bushels to 1,690 million.  Ending stocks are projected at 440 million bushels, down 25 million from last month.  Although soybean crush is unchanged, soybean meal production is reduced on a lower extraction rate.  Soybean meal exports are reduced on a slowing pace of sales and increased competition from Argentina.  Soybean oil balance sheet changes include increased production on a higher extraction rate, increased imports, and increased domestic use.The 2015/16 U.S. season-average farm price forecast for soybeans is projected at $8.05 to $9.55 per bushel, down 10 cents at the midpoint based on prices reported to date.  Soybean meal is forecast at $270 to $310 per short ton, down 20 dollars on both ends.  The soybean oil forecast is unchanged at 28.5 to 31.5 cents per pound.  Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 526.9 million tons, down 2.0 million with lower forecasts for soybeans, sunflowerseed, peanuts, and cottonseed.  Global soybean production is projected at 319.0 million tons, down 1.1 million on smaller crops in the United States and South Africa.  Larger soybean production in China is partly offsetting.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced with lower projections for Argentina and South Africa partly offset by an increase for Russia.  Other changes include reduced cottonseed production for China, India, and Pakistan.Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is projected at 148.0 million tons, up 0.3 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports for Argentina and increased soybean and rapeseed exports for Canada more than offset lower U.S. soybean exports.  Global oilseed crush is projected higher mainly on increased soybean crush for Argentina, China, and Vietnam and increased rapeseed crush for Canada and China.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 90.9 million tons, down 4.2 million on reduced soybean stocks for the United States, Argentina, and China, and reduced rapeseed stocks for Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar production for 2015/16 is projected at 8.934 million short tons, raw value (STRV), a decrease of 57,000 from last month.  Louisiana cane sugar production is reduced 42,000 STRV to 1.423 million based on industry reports for a harvest that is nearly over.  Texas cane sugar production is reduced 15,000 STRV to 115,000 based on the updated processor forecast.  The Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S), the only remaining sugarcane processor in Hawaii, announced on January 6 that it will be terminating cane sugar production by the end of 2016.  This announcement has no effect on projected 2015/16 production.  Beet sugar is unchanged although sugar recovery from beet slicing from August through November is lower than expected.Projected sugar imports are reduced 91,370 STRV to 3.100 million.  Tariff-rate quota (TRQ) imports are reduced 14,846 STRV as calendar year 2015 sugar access under certain Free Trade Agreements went unfilled.  On January 6, the Government of Mexico officially announced that effective February 4, duty free imports of sugar from the United States that have benefitted from the U.S. re-export import program will be prohibited.  Re-export imports are reduced by 76,524 STRV to 238,476.  The sugar export projection is reduced by that same 76,524 STRV amount to 123,476 STRV.Although 2015/16 sugar deliveries through the first two months of the fiscal year are behind the pace expected, no change is made at this time.  2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 1.588 million STRV.  The implied stocks-to-use ratio is 13.0 percent, down from last month\u2019s 13.5. The only change for Mexico is a 65,492 metric ton (MT) reduction in 2015/16 imports stemming from the prohibition of duty-free imports from the United States that have benefitted from the U.S. re-export import program.  The reduction is expected to reduce the amount of imported sugar going to Mexico\u2019s sugar-containing product export IMMEX program.  With no change to total sugar deliveries to the IMMEX program, more domestically produced sugar is assumed to go to that use.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are reduced to 1.081 million MT, implying a stocks-to-consumption ratio of 24.6 percent, a reduction of 1.5 percentage points from last month.  LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The estimate of 2015 total meat production is lowered from last month as lower pork, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets higher beef production.  For 2016, the forecast is raised as higher pork, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets lower forecast beef production.  Higher cattle slaughter in late 2015 resulted in a higher beef production estimate, but lower-than-expected cattle placements in late 2015 are expected to result in lower fed cattle marketings and slaughter in 2016 and the beef production forecast for 2016 is lowered.  USDA will release its semi-annual Cattle report on January 29, providing estimates of heifers held for breeding and an insight into the number of cattle which might be available for placement during 2016.  Pork production for 2015 is lowered as end of year slaughter was lower than expected.  Pork production is increased slightly for 2016.  The Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on December 23, indicated that producers intend to farrow slightly fewer sows on average during the first half of 2016, which may limit growth in the pig crop despite growth in pigs per litter.  However, higher carcass weights will support increased pork production.  Broiler production is lowered for 2015 based on slaughter and hatchery data, but the forecast for 2016 is raised primarily on higher forecast broiler prices.  Turkey production is raised for both the end of 2015 and early 2016 on slaughter and hatchery data.  Egg production for 2015 and 2016 is unchanged.Beef imports for 2015 and 2016 are reduced, reflecting the pace of trade to date and relatively weak prices for processing beef.  Beef exports for the last quarter of 2015 and early 2016 are raised on gains in sales to a number of markets.  Pork imports and exports are unchanged from last month.  Broiler and turkey exports for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month as the export recovery has been slower than expected.    Livestock and poultry prices for 2015 are adjusted for December data.  For 2016, no change is made to the cattle price forecast.  The 2016 hog price forecast is reduced as large supplies of hogs and competition from other meats pressured prices in late 2015 and is expected to pressure prices in early 2016.  Broiler prices improved in late 2015 and early 2016 and the price forecast for 2016 is raised.  Egg prices are lowered for 2016 reflecting recent price movements.Milk production for 2015 is raised on slightly stronger growth in milk per cow.  Forecast 2016 milk production is reduced from last month.  Cow numbers are lowered due to lower expected milk prices and the recent blizzard in Texas and New Mexico.  Growth in milk per cow is reduced on lower milk prices.  Exports are lowered on both a fat- and skim-solids basis as global supplies of dairy products remain large and demand remains relatively weak.  Continued strength in domestic butter use will also limit the competitiveness of U.S. butter in world markets.  Fat and skim solid-basis imports for 2015 are unchanged.  For 2016 both fat and skim-solids imports are raised largely on higher cheese imports. Dairy product prices for 2015 are adjusted for December data.  For 2016, butter prices are raised from last month on relatively strong demand and lower expected production.  Cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey prices are reduced.  Relatively large beginning stocks of cheese and weaker beginning year prices underlie the reduction in the cheese price forecast.  NDM and whey prices are expected to be pressured by weakness in exports.  The Class III price for 2016 is lowered on lower cheese and whey prices and the Class IV price is reduced as a lower NDM price more than offsets a higher butter price.  The all milk price is lowered to $15.35 to $16.15 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The 2015/16 U.S. cotton balance sheet shows marginally lower production and higher ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is lowered 88,000 bales to 12.9 million.  Domestic mill use is reduced 100,000 bales based on spinning activity through November, but exports are unchanged.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 3.1 million bales.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers is narrowed 1 cent on each end, with the midpoint unchanged from last month at 59 cents per pound.The world 2015/16 cotton supply and demand estimates include sharply lower production and ending stocks compared with last month, with consumption reduced slightly.  Global production is reduced more than 2.0 million bales, based on updated harvest reports for Pakistan, China, India, and Turkmenistan.  Pakistan\u2019s crop is reduced 800,000 bales to 7.2 million, its lowest level since 1998, as falling gin arrivals indicate more extensive whitefly damage than previously expected.  World consumption is reduced nearly 500,000 bales, reflecting decreases for India, Pakistan, and the United States.  Imports are raised 725,000 bales, virtually all in Pakistan, while exports are raised for India and others.  World ending stocks are now projected at 102.9 million bales, down 8 percent from the beginning level.",
    "October_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 132.3 million tons, down 0.5 million from last month mainly on lower sunflowerseed, canola, and cottonseed production.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,431 million bushels, nearly unchanged from last month with higher harvested area offsetting lower yields.  Harvested area is projected at a record 89.5 million acres, up 0.8 million.  The soybean yield is forecast at 49.5 bushels per acre, down 0.4 bushels.  With lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies for 2017/18 are projected down 44 million bushels.  With use projections unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 430 million bushels.  If realized, ending stocks relative to use would be the highest since 2006/07.The 2017/18 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.35 to $10.05 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal and soybean oil price projections are also unchanged at $290 to $330 per short ton and 32.5 to 36.5 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 577.0 million tons, down 1.6 million as reductions for soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed are partly offset by increases for cottonseed and peanuts.  Global soybean production is projected down 0.6 million tons to 347.9 million on lower forecasts for Russia and Ukraine.  Higher production for China and Mexico is partly offsetting.  Sunflowerseed production is also lower for Russia and Ukraine on lower yields.  Rapeseed production is lowered for Australia where yields are impacted by below-normal rainfall. Global oilseed exports for 2017/18 are down 0.4 million tons to 173.9 million on lower soybean and sunflowerseed exports.  Soybean exports are lowered for Ukraine while sunflowerseed exports are lowered for Ukraine and Russia.  Lower rapeseed exports for Australia are offset by higher exports for Ukraine.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected down 1.6 million tons from last month to 107.9 million mainly reflecting back-year adjustments that reduced soybean carryin for Brazil and the United States. SUGAR:  Florida cane sugar production for 2017/18 is reduced by 90,038 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 2.036 million, consistent with lower sugarcane production and lower sucrose recovery projected by processors.  Louisiana cane sugar production for 2017/18 is increased by 64,000 STRV to 1.690 million based on increased area harvested and yield forecast by NASS in the Crop Production report.  U.S. beet sugar production for the 2017/18 August-July crop year is forecast at 5.110 million STRV, down 21,000 from last month based on NASS forecasts in the Crop Production report.  Fiscal year 2017/18 beet sugar is decreased by 39,943 STRV to 4.977 million STRV based reductions in crop year production and an increase in early-season beet sugar production estimated for August and September 2017.  Beet sugar production for 2016/17 is increased to 5.022 million STRV based on the higher early-season production.Sugar imported under the raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) for 2016/17 is reduced by 99,166 STRV.  Due to the USDA\u2019s extension of entry of 2016/17 raw sugar TRQ imports to the end of October, 57,670 STRV of the 2016/17 TRQ imports are projected to enter in October 2017, increasing 2017/18 imports.  Free Trade Agreement calendar year TRQ sugar of 16,342 STRV previously expected to enter before September 30 for 2016/17 is now expected to enter before December 31 for 2017/18, shifting projected 2016/17 imports into 2017/18.  Re-export imports for 2016/17 reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection are reported at 413,131 STRV, up 28,313 from last month.  Total imports from Mexico for 2016/17 are estimated at 1.206 million STRV, down 10,000 from last month.  Imports from Mexico for 2017/18 are projected at 1.789 million STRV, up 17,938 from last month but below the Target Quantity of U.S. Needs of 1.812 million calculated by the Commerce Department based on the September WASDE.Sugar imported under the raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) for 2016/17 is reduced by 99,166 STRV.  Due to the USDA\u2019s extension of entry of 2016/17 raw sugar TRQ imports to the end of October, 57,670 STRV of the 2016/17 TRQ imports are projected to enter in October 2017, increasing 2017/18 imports.  Free Trade Agreement calendar year TRQ sugar of 16,342 STRV previously expected to enter before September 30 for 2016/17 is now expected to enter before December 31 for 2017/18, shifting projected 2016/17 imports into 2017/18.  Re-export imports for 2016/17 reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection are reported at 413,131 STRV, up 28,313 from last month.  Total imports from Mexico for 2016/17 are estimated at 1.206 million STRV, down 10,000 from last month.  Imports from Mexico for 2017/18 are projected at 1.789 million STRV, up 17,938 from last month but below the Target Quantity of U.S. Needs of 1.812 million calculated by the Commerce Department based on the September WASDE.Mexico 2016/17 ending stocks are estimated up 15,352 metric tons (MT) as higher imports of 10,000 for consumption and 15,178 for IMMEX are partially offset by higher exports of 9,826.  Although 2016/17 sugar exports to the United States are down 8,578 MT from last month, exports to third countries and for the U.S. re-export import program are now estimated at 18,404 MT higher than last month.  The resulting increase in 2017/18 sugar supply is available for export to the U.S. market, while allowing Mexico to maintain an ending stocks-to-consumption bound of 18.0 percent for anticipated use in 2018/19 before the start of the harvest. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2017 total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher broiler and turkey production more than offset fractionally lower beef and pork production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month largely due to lower expected fourth-quarter carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is lowered on smaller-than-expected third-quarter commercial hog slaughter which more than offset higher expected second-half carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is raised on expectations of increased slaughter later in the year based on hatchery data.  The turkey forecast is increased as higher third-quarter slaughter more than offsets expected declines in fourth-quarter slaughter.  The 2017 egg production forecast is raised from last month on higher hatching egg production. For 2018, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month as higher expected beef and pork production more than offset declines in turkey production.  Beef production is little changed from last month although first half production is lowered as pasture conditions are expected to slow the pace of placements in the latter part of 2017.  However, heavier carcass weights are expected to offset a portion of the decline.  Pork production is raised from last month on higher slaughter.  In the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released September 28, producers indicated they farrowed about 2 percent more sows in June-August and intend to farrow approximately 1 percent more sows over each of the next two quarters.  With larger pig crops in the second half of 2017 and into 2018, pork production is forecast higher. The 2018 broiler and egg production forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  Turkey production forecasts for 2018 are lowered on slow recovery in demand which is expected to dampen the pace of expansion. Beef import forecasts are raised in 2017 and 2018 on increased shipments of processing beef from Oceania.  The 2017 and 2018 beef export forecasts are raised on strong demand in a number of key trading partners.  Pork imports for 2017 and 2018 are raised from last month.  The 2017 pork export forecast is lowered from the previous month on recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2018 export forecast.  Annual broiler, turkey, and egg export forecasts are unchanged. Cattle price forecasts are unchanged for 2017 and 2018.  Hog price forecasts are lowered for the last quarter of 2017 and into 2018 on larger supplies and pressure from abundant supplies of red meat and poultry.  The annual broiler price is forecast slightly lower for 2017 but is unchanged for 2018.  Turkey price forecasts are lowered in 2017 and 2018 on slow recovery in demand.  Egg price forecasts are raised on near-term demand strength which is expected to carry over into next year. The milk production forecast for 2017 and 2018 is raised on a slightly more rapid pace of growth in milk per cow.  However, forecast cow numbers for late 2017 and 2018 are slightly lower.  Fat basis imports for 2017 and 2018 are raised on strength in butter imports but skim-solids imports are lowered for 2017 and unchanged for 2018.  Exports on a fat basis are raised for 2017 on stronger butter and cheese exports, and increased sales of butter and anhydrous milkfat are expected to support higher fat basis exports in 2018.  Skim-solids exports for 2017 and 2018 are raised, primarily on stronger expected shipments of whey products.    For 2017, butter and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are lowered on large supplies, but the whey price is unchanged at the midpoint and the cheese price forecast is raised on current demand strength.  For 2018, continued demand strength for cheese is reflected in a higher price forecast, while butter, NDM, and whey prices are lowered on larger supplies and pressure from international prices.  The Class III price is raised for 2017 on stronger cheese prices, but for 2018, lower whey prices are expected to more than offset the increases in cheese prices, and the price forecast is lowered.  The Class IV price is lowered for both years due to lower forecast butter and NDM prices.  The 2017 all milk price forecast range is $17.75 to $17.85 per cwt, unchanged at the midpoint, but the 2018 price is lowered to $17.45 to $18.35 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2017/18 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show lower production, exports, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is reduced 643,000 bales, largely in Texas and Georgia.  Domestic mill use is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is reduced 400,000 bales to 14.5 million, due to reduced U.S. production and strong competitor shipments.  Ending stocks are forecast 200,000 bales below the previous month\u2019s forecast.  The resulting stocks-to-use ratio of 32.5 percent is virtually unchanged from the previous month\u2019s forecast, and the highest since 2008/09.  The forecast range for the marketing year average farm price is 55.0 to 65.0 cents per pound; the midpoint of 60.0 cents is unchanged from the previous month\u2019s projection.The global cotton supply and demand forecasts for 2017/18 include relatively small increases from the previous month for production, consumption, and trade.  Production is raised about 100,000 bales as larger expected crops in Argentina, Brazil, and Greece more than offset the reduction in the forecast for the United States.  Vietnam is the primary driver behind a 250,000-bale increase in projected world consumption, while a 440,000-bale increase in projected 2017/18 world cotton trade reflects increases in India, Australia, and Brazil that more than offset lower expected U.S. exports.

    "October_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 115.3 million tons, down 0.8 million from last month.  Soybean production is forecast at 3,888 million bushels, down 47 million with higher yields only partly offsetting reduced harvested area.  The soybean yield is forecast at 47.2 bushels per acre, up 0.1 bushels from the September forecast.  Harvested area is reduced 1.1 million acres to 82.4 million.  Soybean supplies for 2015/16 are projected 66 million bushels below last month with lower beginning stocks and production.  Sunflowerseed and canola production are forcast higher on higher yields and harvested area.U.S. soybean exports for 2015/16 are reduced 50 million bushels to 1,675 million on the slow pace of sales and increased competitor supplies.  Soybean crush is projected at 1,880 million, up 10 million on higher domestic soybean meal disappearance, which is raised in line with an increase for 2014/15.  Soybean ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 425 million bushels, down 25 million.  The soybean price is projected at $8.40 to $9.90, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal and soybean oil price projections are also unchanged at $310 to $350 per short ton and 27.5 to 30.5 cents per pound, respectively.Soybean balance sheet changes for 2014/15 include lower planted and harvested area, lower yield, production, and ending stocks from the September 30 Grain Stocks report.  Exports are increased based on final trade data for the marketing year.  Soybean crush is raised based on data from the October 1 Fats and Oils: Oilseed Crushings, Production, Consumption and Stocks report published by NASS.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 531.0 million tons, up 3.9 million from last month on higher soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, and peanut production.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 320.5 million tons, up 0.9 million with higher Brazil production only partly offset by lower projections for the United States, India, and Ukraine.  Brazil soybean production is projected at a record 100.0 million tons on higher area.  A sharp decline in the value of the Brazilian real recent months is expected to lead to increased area despite lower international soybean prices this year.  Soybean crops in Ukraine and India are reduced on lower projected yields.  Rapeseed production for Canada is projected at 14.3 million tons, up 1.0 million based on higher yields reported in the most recent survey from Statistics Canada.  Global sunflowerseed production is raised on higher estimates for Argentina and Ukraine.  Global cottonseed production is projected lower with reductions for China and Pakistan only partly offset an increase for Brazil.Global oilseed stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 96.3 million tons, up 1.4 million mainly on higher rapeseed stocks in Canada and China, and higher sunflowerseed stocks in Argentina and Ukraine.  Global soybean stocks are raised marginally as higher stocks for Brazil are only partly offset by reductions for the United States, Argentina, and India.SUGAR:  Total imports for 2014/15 are increased by 42,721 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 3.544 million based on September data from U.S. Customs. Imports from Mexico are increased by 79,000 STRV for a 2014/15 total of 1.530 million STRV.  This estimate, if realized, would exceed by about 4,000 STRV, the export limit imposed by the Countervail Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement. Other 2014/15 import changes are: an increase in re-export imports by 9,492 STRV; imports under tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) decreased by 44,895 and high-tier tariff imports decreased by 610. Exports are increased by 15,000 STRV to 180,000 based on pace to date. Deliveries for human consumption are increased by 60,000 STRV to 11.935 million based on large imports of refined sugar for direct consumption, mostly from Mexico. Although classified as deliveries for human consumption, analysis of individual sourcing components and of import data strongly imply an estimated 90,000 STRV of the imported sugar is not being immediately consumed but is being held for delivery in the 2015/16 marketing year by entities not required to report to USDA.  Ending stocks are estimated at 1.697 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.9 percent.Total 2015/16 U.S. production is forecast at 8.760 million STRV, a 26,000 increase from last month. Beet sugar for the 2015/16 August-July crop year is forecast at 5.243 million STRV, an increase of 41,000 based on NASS-reported improved sugarbeet yield and processor-reported sucrose levels of 17.95 percent. All of the increase is projected to occur in the 2015/16 fiscal year, implying production at 5.075 million. Cane sugar production in Hawaii is reduced 15,000 STRV to 165,000 based on processor\u2019s forecasts. Imports are projected up 3,694 STRV based on minor changes amongst TRQ suppliers. As a result of refined sugar from non-reporting entities imported in 2014/15 but likely held for marketing at a later time, deliveries for human consumption are reduced by the estimated 90,000 STRV to 11.785 million.  The 2015/16 ending stocks are forecast at 1.736 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.3 percent.Mexico 2014/15 imports are increased by 10,912 metric tons (MT) for more refined sugar imported from the United States for the IMMEX sugar-containing products export program. Exports for 2014/15 to the United States are increased by 67,611 MT to 1.309 million based on USDA estimated imports from Mexico. Exports to other destinations are reduced by 18,525 MT to 131,475 based on reporting by Comite Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Azucar (CONADESUCA).  Because there are no changes in supply or use for 2015/16, ending stocks fall by the same 38,174 MT for both 2014/15 and 2015/16. The stocks-to-consumption ratios of 17.2 percent in 2014/15 and 17.0 percent in 2015/16 are below the historical average of 22 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2015 and 2016 are increased from last month.  Beef production for 2015 is raised on larger forecast slaughter of fed cattle in the second half of 2015 and heavier carcass weights.  The forecast for 2016 is raised as cattle slaughter and carcass weights in the first half are projected higher than last month.  The pork production forecasts for both 2015 and 2016 are raised. The pace of hog slaughter in the remainder of 2015 is expected to be higher.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs estimated less of a decline in sows farrowing during June-August than indicated in prior intentions and farrowing intentions into early 2016 support an increase in forecast pork production for 2016.  Broiler production is raised for 2015 as a larger third quarter level more than offsets a reduction for the fourth quarter, but the forecast for 2016 is reduced as broiler producers have slowed the pace of egg sets.  Turkey production for 2015 is lowered based on third-quarter production data; subsequent quarters through 2016 are unchanged.  Egg production for 2015 is raised on higher third quarter hatching egg production.  Production forecasts for 2016 are unchanged.Beef imports are unchanged for 2015 and 2016.  Beef exports for 2015 and 2016 are lowered as demand is projected to remain relatively weak.  Pork export forecasts are unchanged, but a small increase is made to third-quarter 2015 imports based on recent trade data.  Broiler exports are reduced from last month as slow global demand is expected to continue for in the remainder of the year and into 2016.  Cattle prices for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month on current large supplies of market-ready cattle, weaker demand and competition from relatively large supplies of competing meats.  Hog prices are raised for both 2015 and 2016 as demand has firmed.  Broiler prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016 on relatively large broiler meat supplies.  Turkey prices are raised for 2015 on current price strength, but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged from last month.  Egg prices for 2015 are lowered reflecting recent price declines, but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.Milk production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged from last month.  Fat-basis imports are increased as domestic demand continues to support higher imports of cheese and butter.  Exports are reduced for 2015 on weaker cheese sales, but are unchanged for 2016.  Skim-solids imports are reduced for 2015 and 2016, while exports are reduced for 2015 and unchanged for 2016.  Large world supplies of dairy products, a strong dollar, and generally weak global demand are expected to continue to pressure exports during 2015 and 2016. Although butter prices have declined sharply from recent high levels, domestic demand for butter is expected to support relatively high butter prices during 2016.  The butter price for 2015 is unchanged at the midpoint, and is raised for 2016.  Cheese prices are raised for 2015 and 2016 on support from domestic demand.  Nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are forecast higher in 2015 and 2016 reflecting a rebound in both domestic and international prices.  Whey prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016 as supplies are large.  Class III prices are raised for 2015, but lowered for 2016 as the decline in whey prices more than offsets higher cheese prices.  Class IV prices are raised for both 2015 and 2016 due to higher butter and NDM prices. The all milk price is raised to $16.90 to $17.00 per cwt for 2015, but lowered to $16.05 to $16.95 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The 2015/16 U.S. cotton forecasts include marginally lower production and ending stocks relative to last month, with prices reduced sharply.  Production is lowered 90,000 bales. Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  Ending stocks are now projected at 3.1 million bales, or 22 percent of total use.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to range from 54 to 64 cents per pound.  The mid-point of 59 cents per pound is reduced 3 cents from last month, as relatively weak global demand for yarn and lower prices for polyester are pressuring world cotton prices.The 2015/16 world cotton forecasts show higher beginning stocks, lower production and consumption, and higher ending stocks relative to last month.  Beginning stocks are raised about 900,000 bales, due mainly to a reduction in China\u2019s 2014/15 consumption, which reflects indications of net cotton textile exports that are lower than previously expected.  Production for 2015/16 is reduced for China, Pakistan, and Brazil, but is raised for Mali.  Consumption is reduced mainly in China, Pakistan, and India.  With world trade virtually unchanged from last month, global stocks are now projected at 107 million bales.  ",
    "January_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is estimated at 97.3 million tons, up 0.9 million tons from last month.  Larger crops for soybeans, cottonseed, and peanuts are partly offset by reductions for sunflowerseed and canola.  Soybean production is estimated at 3.289 billion bushels, up 31 million bushels based on increased yields and harvested area.  The soybean yield is estimated at 43.3 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels from the previous estimate.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1.700 billion reflecting higher projected soybean meal exports, which partly offsets a reduction for Argentina.  Soybean exports are increased 20 million bushels to 1.495 billion reflecting record shipments during the first quarter of the marketing year and strong sales through December.  Soybean ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 150 million bushels, unchanged for last month.  Soybean oil balance sheet changes include increased production on a higher crush and extraction rate, reduced imports, increased projected exports, and increased ending stocks.The 2013/14 U.S. season-average farm price forecast for soybeans is narrowed 25 cents on both ends of the range to $11.75 to $13.25 per bushel based on prices reported to date.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 35.5 to 39.5 cents per pound, down 2.5 cents on both ends.  The soybean meal price is projected at $415 to $455 per short ton, up 15 dollars on both ends of the range.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at a record 505.9 million tons, up 3.6 million.  Global soybean production is projected at 286.8 million tons, up 1.9 million on gains for the United States and Brazil.  The Brazil soybean crop projection is raised 1.0 million tons to a record 89.0 million.  The increase is due to higher projected area reflecting recent survey data from the Brazilian government.  Global sunflowerseed production is raised 1.3 million tons to 43.7 million on record forecasts for Ukraine, Russia, and the European Union.  The Ukraine crop is raised 1.0 million tons to 12.5 million on higher yields.  Other changes include increased cottonseed production for China and Argentina, lower cottonseed production for Pakistan, and increased rapeseed production for Russia.Global oilseed trade for 2013/14 is projected at 128.9 million tons, up slightly from last month.  Increased soybean exports for the United States are partly offset by reduced rapeseed export prospects for Australia and Canada.  Lower soybean meal exports for Argentina resulting from lower soybean crush are offset by gains for the United States, Brazil, and Russia.  Increased global soybean oil trade mainly reflects a higher projection for the United States.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 85.1 million tons, up 2.3 million from last month on increased soybean stocks in Argentina and Brazil, increased canola stocks in Canada, and higher sunflowerseed stocks in Russia and Ukraine.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 94,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, mainly due to lower production in Louisiana.  Total use is unchanged. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total red meat and poultry production for both 2013 and 2014 are lowered from December.  For 2013, beef production is raised, but pork, broiler, and turkey production are reduced.  The forecast for 2014 is reduced as lower pork and turkey production more than offset an increased beef production forecast.  The Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on December 27, indicated that the September-November pig crop was fractionally below a year earlier which will constrain supplies of slaughter hogs in early 2014.  Although producers intend to farrow more sows in the first half of 2014, the impacts of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) will likely slow growth in pigs per litter and keep supplies of market hogs relatively tight during 2014.  Beef production is raised for 2014 as higher-than-expected placements in the later part of 2013 and expected availability of winter pasture support increased cattle marketings and slaughter during the year.  No change is made to 2014 broiler production.  Egg production is reduced slightly for 2013 and 2014.Beef imports are unchanged for 2013, but are raised slightly for 2014.  Beef exports are raised for both 2013 and 2014 as the pace of exports over the past several months has been strong.  Pork imports and exports for both 2013 and 2014 are unchanged from last month.  The 2013 broiler export forecast is raised slightly based on exports to date, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Turkey exports for 2013 and 2014 are unchanged from last month.Animal product prices for 2013 are adjusted based on December data.  For 2014, the cattle price forecast is raised from last month as demand for fed cattle remains strong.  Hog prices are raised as the production forecast is lowered.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised from last month.  Demand for broiler meat is firm, supported by tight supplies of beef.  Turkey prices are expected to be supported by lower forecast production in early 2014.  Egg prices are forecast higher, reflecting current price strength.The 2013 milk production estimate is reduced from last month, based on recent milk production data.  The forecast for 2014 is raised as improving returns are expected to support a more rapid increase in output per cow.  Fat basis imports are reduced for 2013 and 2014 on lower expected imports of butterfat.  On a skim-solids basis, imports are reduced slightly for 2013 but are unchanged for 2014.  Fat basis exports are raised for both 2013 and 2014 on relatively strong demand for cheese and other products.  Skim-solids exports are reduced slightly for 2013 as NDM exports lagged in November.  However, exports are expected to strengthen in 2014 and the skim-solids export forecast is raised. Dairy product and milk prices for 2013 are adjusted to reflect December data.  For 2014, cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are raised as export and domestic demand are expected to strengthen, but the forecast for dry whey is unchanged.  The Class III price is raised due to the higher cheese prices and the Class IV price forecast reflects higher butter and NDM prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $20.60 to $21.40 per cwt for 2014.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton estimates for 2013/14 are revised slightly to reflect higher production.  Production is raised 118,000 bales from last month, due mainly to an increase for Texas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are raised to 10.5 million, leaving ending stocks unchanged at 3.0 million bales.  The marketing-year average price is projected in a narrower range of 72-77 cents per pound, with the midpoint of 74.5 cents raised marginally from last month.The 2013/14 world cotton supply and demand estimates include higher production and marginally lower consumption, resulting in an increase of 1.2 million bales in ending stocks.  Production is raised mainly for China, where government classing data indicates that Xinjiang production, which accounts for about 60 percent of the total, may exceed 2012/13.  Production also is raised for Argentina, but is reduced for Pakistan, and Pakistan\u2019s consumption also is reduced.  World stocks are now projected at 97.6 million bales, with China accounting for 60 percent of the total.",
    "April_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supplies for 2014/15 are projected at 4,091 million bushels, up 5 million on increased imports.  Soybean exports and crush projections are unchanged at 1,790 million and 1,795 million bushels, respectively.  Seed use is raised in line with the record plantings indicated in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report, and residual use is raised based on indications from the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  U.S. soybean ending stocks are projected at 370 million bushels, down 15 million from last month.Soybean oil supplies are increased this month with higher imports more than offsetting slightly lower production resulting from a lower oil extraction rate.  Soybean oil domestic disappearance is raised on increased food use which offsets reductions for palm oil and canola oil consumption.  Despite lower projected soybean oil exports, ending stocks are projected at 1.38 billion pounds, down 125 million from last month.Projected prices for soybeans and soybean oil are reduced this month.  The range for the season-average soybean price is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint to $9.60 to $10.60 per bushel based on marketings to date and lower expected prices for the second half of the marketing year.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 30 to 33 cents per pound, down 0.5 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $355 to $385 per short ton, unchanged at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 532.8 million tons, up 0.6 million from last month.  Gains for soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed more than offset lower projections for peanuts, copra, palm kernel, and cottonseed.  Global soybean production is projected at 315.5 million tons, up 0.4 million from last month.  Argentina soybean production is forecast at 57.0 million tons, up 1.0 million from last month on higher yields resulting from favorable rainfall and mild temperatures across much of the growing area.  India soybean production is reduced 0.7 million tons to 9.8 million reflecting below average yields resulting from an unusually short monsoon season.  Uruguay soybean production is raised this month on higher harvested area.  Changes for other crops include higher rapeseed production for India; higher sunflowerseed production for Argentina, Bolivia, and Russia; lower peanut production for Vietnam; lower cottonseed production for India and Australia; and lower copra production for the Philippines.  Palm oil production is reduced for Malaysia on excessive rainfall in December and January and also for Thailand on dry conditions in the southern producing areas.SUGAR:  U.S. 2014/15 beginning sugar stocks are increased 13,874 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 1.810 million based on revised processors\u2019 estimates of 2013/14 cane sugar production and other miscellaneous adjustments that resulted in an increase to the ending stocks estimate for 2013/14.  Imports for 2014/15 are increased by 36,524 STRV to 3.464 million, stemming mostly from sugar entering under free trade agreements that was previously expected to be imported in the first quarter of 2015/16.  With no other changes, the 2014/15 ending stocks projection rises by 50,398 STRV to 1.700 million, implying a 13.9 percent ending stocks-to-use ratio.Mexico 2014/15 sugar production is reduced by 101,372 metric tons (MT) to 6.050 million due to a slower than anticipated production pace, especially in the state of Veracruz that has experienced excessive precipitation in the first 3 months of 2015, with especially severe weather in March. Deliveries for human consumption are increased by 50,000 MT to 4.250 million, based on a strong pace-to-date through February.  Exports to destinations other than the United States are reduced by 125,000 MT to 200,000 because of much lower world raw sugar prices than existed when certain contracts for export were originally negotiated.  Exports to the United States are still forecast at 1.306 million MT, the maximum amount as set under the terms of the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico, dated December 19, 2014.  Ending stocks are projected residually at 975,069 MT, an increase of 26,372 from last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2015 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher beef and pork production more than offset lower turkey production.  The forecast for broiler production is unchanged.  Beef is higher on greater cow slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Pork production is increased on higher-than-expected first-quarter slaughter and expectations of larger second-half slaughter.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, released on March 27, estimated the December-February pig crop was 9 percent higher and indicated that producers intend to farrow 2 percent more sows in March-May.  Turkey production is reduced based on slaughter and hatchery data to date.  The egg production forecast is lowered based on recent hatchery data. The 2015 beef import forecast is raised from last month as demand for processing grade beef remains strong and strength of the dollar makes the United States an attractive market.  Beef exports for 2015 are raised based on trade data to date.  Pork exports are unchanged from last month, but the forecast for imports is raised as the strong dollar makes the United States an attractive market despite larger production.  The broiler export forecast is lowered.  The recovery in exports after U.S.-wide highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)-related restrictions has been limited by weak economic growth in a number of key markets and the strong dollar.  Turkey exports are also reduced as the strength of the dollar makes it difficult to expand exports in the face of HPAI restrictions from a number of countries.  The egg export forecast is unchanged. Cattle prices for 2015 are raised as demand for fed cattle remains strong.  The hog price forecast is reduced as greater production pressures prices.  Broiler prices are unchanged at the midpoint.  Turkey prices are lowered.  The egg price is raised on strong demand and slightly lower production. The milk production forecast for 2015 is lowered from last month as growth in output per cow is constrained by dry conditions in the West.  Fat basis imports are raised on demand for butterfat, but skim-solids imports are unchanged.  Exports are hampered by relatively weak international prices and the strong dollar; thus forecasts for both fat and skim-solids are reduced from last month.  \u00a0Product price forecasts for butter and cheese are raised on domestic demand strength.  However, relatively weak exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM) are expected to pressure prices lower.  The whey price forecast is unchanged.  The Class III price is raised on the strength of cheese prices, but the Class IV price is reduced as a lower NDM price more than offsets a higher butter price.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.10 to $17.60 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2014/15 cotton supply and demand estimates include higher production and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is raised to 16.3 million bales to reflect the USDA\u2019s final Cotton Ginnings report, released March 25, 2015.  With no revisions to domestic mill use or exports, ending stocks are raised 200,000 bales to 4.4 million.  The range of 59 to 61 cents per pound for the estimated marketing year average price received by producers is reduced 1 cent on the upper end, based on prices to date. The aggregate 2014/15 world supply and demand estimates show very marginal changes from last month.  World production is virtually the same at 119 million bales, as decreases for India and Uzbekistan are offset by increases for the United States, Mexico, Pakistan, and others.  Consumption is raised marginally, as increases for India, Vietnam, and Pakistan are mostly offset by reductions for Turkey, Brazil, Hong Kong, and others.  World trade is lowered slightly, including increases in imports by China and Vietnam and reductions for several other countries.  Global stocks of 110 million bales are virtually unchanged from last month.",
    "February_2020": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s 2019/20 U.S. soybean outlook is for increased exports and lower ending stocks.  Soybean exports for 2019/20 are projected at 1.825 billion bushels, up 50 million from last month partly reflecting increased imports for China.  With soybean crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks are reduced 50 million bushels to 425 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $8.75 per bushel, down 25 cents reflecting reported prices to date.  The soybean oil price forecast is lowered 0.5 cents to 33.5 cents per pound.  The soybean meal price forecast is unchanged at $305.00 per short ton.  This month\u2019s 2019/20 global oilseed outlook includes higher production, trade, and stocks relative to last month.  Global oilseed production is raised 2.2 million tons to 576.8 million, with higher soybean, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed production.  Partly offsetting is lower palm kernel production.  Soybean production for Brazil is increased 2 million tons to 125 million due to favorable weather in Mato Grosso as well as improved rainfall in southern and northeastern soybean areas.  Sunflowerseed production is increased for Ukraine on a higher yield.  Palm kernel and palm oil production are reduced for Malaysia and Indonesia on current production to date and dry weather conditions throughout the past year.Global 2019/20 oilseed exports are raised mainly on a 2.4-million-ton increase to soybean trade.  China\u2019s soybean imports are increased 3 million tons to 88 million reflecting higher soybean crush.  Correspondingly, soybean exports are increased for the United States, Brazil, and Ukraine.  Global soybean ending stocks are 2.2 million tons higher than last month, with higher stocks for China and Brazil.SUGAR:  Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.672 million metric tons (MT), a reduction of 99,994 from last month.  This forecast matches the survey-based estimate made by CONADESUCA on February 5.  Imports and domestic deliveries are unchanged.  Ending stocks are increased slightly to reflect 2.5 months of forecast domestic sugar use before the start of the 2020/21 sugarcane harvest.  These changes of 101,388 MT flow through to a reduction of forecast exports.  Exports outside of those shipments under license to the United States are reduced to 32,951 MT, an amount estimated by CONADESUCA that is equal to exports through January 26.  Exports to the United States are reduced by 94,296 MT to 1.469 million.  Total U.S. supply for 2019/20 is reduced by 33,694 short tons, raw value (STRV) on lower forecast imports.  Imports from Mexico are reduced 110,180 STRV to 1.717 million.  TRQ imports are increased by 70,486 STRV to 1.674 million.  This increase reflects the USTR reallocation of unused country-specific quota allocations for the fiscal year 2019/20 WTO raw sugar TRQ announced on February 6.  The resulting raw sugar WTO shortfall is projected at 40,000 STRV.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 1.516 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.36 percent, down from 12.69 percent last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2020 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month on higher forecast beef, pork, and broiler production.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month on higher cattle slaughter and heavier cattle weights in the first half of the year.  However, the forecasts for second half beef production is reduced on lower anticipated steer and heifer slaughter in the second half of the year.  This reflects a smaller number of cattle outside feedlots implied by the January 1 Cattle report which results in lower placements during 2020.  Pork production is raised on higher expected hog slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Broiler production is raised on recent hatchery data which shows continued growth in the laying flock.  The turkey production forecast is decreased as hatchery data points toward slower expected production growth.  Forecast egg production is increased.  Estimates of 2019 red meat, poultry, and egg production are adjusted to reflect December data. For 2020, the beef export forecast is lowered slightly reflecting weakness in several markets, but no change is made to the beef import forecast.  The pork export forecast is raised from last month on expected robust global demand.  The turkey export forecast is reduced from last month.  Broiler and egg trade forecasts are unchanged for 2020.  Livestock, poultry and egg trade estimates for 2019 are adjusted to reflect December trade data.Fed-cattle prices for the first quarter of 2020 are lowered from last month on recent prices.  Hog price forecasts are reduced from last month on increased production.  Broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised from the previous month as demand remains strong. The milk production forecast for 2020 is unchanged from last month.  The 2020 fat basis export and import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is unchanged while the export forecast is raised on the strength of international demand for nonfat dry milk/skim milk powder.  Dairy supply and use estimates for 2019 are adjusted to reflect December data.Annual product price forecasts for cheese and butter are lowered from the previous month as demand remains relatively weak.  The 2020 nonfat dry milk forecast is unchanged while the whey price forecast is raised from last month.  The Class III price is reduced on the lower cheese price forecast while the Class IV price is reduced, reflecting a lower butter price forecast.  The 2020 all milk price forecast is reduced to $18.85 per cwt. COTTON:  The U.S. cotton estimates for 2019/20 are unchanged, except for a 1 cent-per-pound reduction in the season-average upland farm price, to 62 cents, 8.3 cents lower than in 2018/19.The 2019/20 world cotton forecasts include a 2.5-million-bale increase in ending stocks, driven by both larger production and lower consumption.  A 1-million-bale decline in China\u2019s expected consumption is the largest single change this month:  consumption is lower despite the positive impact of the U.S.-China trade agreement, due in part to the negative economic effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak.  Consumption is also projected lower in Vietnam but higher in Pakistan and Turkey.  Production in Brazil in 2018/19 is revised upward by 480,000 bales reflecting higher production in Mato Grosso.  Pakistan, Brazil, and Tanzania production in 2019/20 is revised upward.  Total production changes this month come to a 1.3-million-bale global increase, while total consumption changes net to a 1.2-million-bale reduction.",
    "May_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 100.9 million tons, up 9 percent from 2012/13.  Higher soybean production accounts for most of the increase.  Sunflowerseed, peanut, and cottonseed production are each projected below last year\u2019s crops.  Soybean production is projected at a record 3.390 billion bushels, up 375 million from the drought-reduced 2012 crop on slightly higher harvested area and higher yields. Soybean yields are projected at a weather-adjusted trend level of 44.5 bushels per acre, up 4.9 bushels from 2012.  Soybean supplies are projected at 3.530 billion bushels, up 10 percent from 2012/13.  Additional soybean meal exports for 2012/13 are offset by reduced domestic consumption, leaving crush unchanged.  Soybean exports and ending stocks for 2012/13 are also unchanged from last month.The 2013/14 U.S. soybean crush is projected at 1.695 billion bushels, up 60 million from 2012/13 reflecting increased domestic soybean meal consumption and exports.  Despite increased competition from South America, U.S. soybean meal exports are forecast higher on sharply lower prices.  Soybean exports are projected at 1.450 billion bushels, up 100 million from 2012/13 on increased supplies and competitive prices.  Ending stocks are projected at 265 million bushels, up 140 million from 2012/13.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2013/14 is forecast at $9.50 to $11.50 per bushel compared with $14.30 per bushel in 2012/13.  Soybean meal and oil prices are forecast at $280-$320 per short ton and 47-51 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at a record 491.3 million tons, up 4.7 percent from 2012/13 mainly due to increased soybean production.  Global soybean production is projected at 285.5 million tons, up 6 percent.  The Argentina soybean crop is projected at 54.5 million tons, up 3.5 million from 2012/13 on record planted area and higher yields.  The Brazil soybean crop is projected at a record 85 million tons as higher harvested area more than offsets lower yields.  China soybean production is projected at 12 million tons, down 0.6 million from 2012/13 as producers continue to shift area to more profitable crops.  If realized, harvested area at 6.6 million hectares would be down 28 percent in the past 4 years.  Global production of high-oil content seeds (rapeseed and sunflowerseed) is projected up 6.1 percent from 2012/13 on increased rapeseed production in Canada, India, EU-27, and Ukraine, and increased sunflowerseed production in Argentina, EU-27, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey.  Oilseed supplies are up 5.1 percent from 2012/13.  With crush projected to increase 3.4 percent, global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 82.6 million tons, up 12.3 million.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 2.7 percent in 2013/14.  Protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.3 percent in China, accounting for 32 percent of global protein consumption gains.  Global soybean exports are projected at 107.1 million tons, up 11.3 percent from 2012/13.  China soybean imports are projected at 69 million tons, up 10 million from the revised 2012/13 projection, leaving soybean supplies up 5 million tons from the previous year.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected to rise 3 percent in 2013/14, led by increases for China, India, and Indonesia.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is up 2.1 percent from 2012/13, as higher beginning stocks and imports more than offset lower production.  Lower beet sugar production reflects reduced area and a return to trend yields, while lower cane sugar production is based on trend yields.  Imports under the tariff rate quota (TRQ) reflect minimum U.S. commitments to import raw and refined sugar and projected shortfall.  The Secretary will establish the TRQ at a later date.  Total use is up 1.8 percent and ending stocks are slightly higher than a year earlier.For Mexico, 2013/14 supplies are down 1.8 percent from 2012/13, as higher beginning stocks are offset by lower production.  Higher domestic use and lower ending stocks are based on trends in population and reasonable carryover requirements, respectively.  Exports to all destinations are lower, but shipments to the U.S. market are up 5.3 percent from 2012/13. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production in 2014 is projected to be above 2013 as higher pork and poultry production more than offsets declines in beef production.  Tighter cattle supplies and potential heifer retention during late 2013 and into 2014 are expected to limit cattle available for placement, thereby reducing fed cattle slaughter in 2014.  Lower cow numbers and herd rebuilding will also limit non-fed beef production.  Pork production is forecast to increase more rapidly than in 2013 as lower forecast feed costs provide incentives for producers to expand farrowings and increase carcass weights from 2013 levels.  Broiler and turkey production are forecast higher as lower forecast feed prices encourage expansion despite lower poultry prices. Egg production for 2014 is forecast to expand as producers respond to lower feed costs.   The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2013 is lowered from last month as lower pork, broiler, and turkey production more than offsets greater beef production.  Higher cattle placements are expected to support higher fed beef production and cow slaughter has remained relatively high.  However, recent winter storms have affected cattle weights which are lowered slightly from last month.  Pork production is down marginally on lower forecast slaughter in the second of half of 2013.  Broiler production is lowered on hatchery and chick placement data to date, while turkey production is cut on lower poult placements. Continued year-over-year declines in U.S. beef production are expected to push beef exports lower in 2014.  Pork exports are expected to rebound in 2014 as supplies increase and demand improves.  Broiler exports are forecast higher on expanded supplies and moderating prices.  Beef imports are expected to be higher in 2014 as U.S. cow slaughter declines and domestic non-fed beef supplies tighten.  Pork imports are forecast up fractionally from 2013.The 2013 red meat export forecast is lowered from last month, largely due to lower expected pork exports.  The beef forecast is adjusted to reflect lower first-quarter exports.  Poultry exports are raised as higher broiler exports more than offset lower turkey exports.For 2014, cattle prices are forecast to rise above 2013 as supplies continue to tighten. Hog prices are forecast to be slightly lower than 2013 on higher production.  Broiler, turkey, and egg prices are forecast to be below 2013 as production expands. Cattle price forecasts for 2013 are unchanged from last month. Hog prices are down fractionally from last month on weaker second quarter prices.  Broiler prices are forecast higher as prices remain strong.Milk production for 2014 is forecast higher as lower feed costs and relatively strong milk prices are expected to support production.  Commercial exports are forecast higher on robust international demand.  Imports will be lower on greater domestic supplies.  With higher domestic production, cheese, butter, and whey prices are forecast lower than last year, while nonfat dry milk (NDM) is higher largely on continued strength in international demand.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are forecast lower.  In the case of Class IV, lower forecast butter prices more than offset higher NDM prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $18.85 to $19.85 per cwt for 2014.Forecast milk production in 2013 is unchanged from last month.  Imports are raised.  Exports are higher as abundant U.S. supplies and competitive prices are expected to spur foreign demand.  Cheese, butter, and NDM prices are raised from last month while whey is lower.  The Class III price is lowered as lower whey prices more than offset greater cheese prices.  Class IV is up reflecting higher prices for butter and NDM.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.50 to $20.00 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton projections for 2013/14 include lower production, exports, and ending stocks compared with 2012/13.  Projected production is reduced 19 percent to 14.0 million bales, based on regional average abandonment and yields.  Abandonment for the Southwest region is projected at 25 percent due to continued drought conditions.  Domestic mill use is projected at 3.5 million bales, 100,000 bales above 2012/13.  Exports are projected at 11.5 million bales, down 13 percent from 2012/13, due to the smaller available domestic supply and lower imports by China.  Ending stocks are reduced to 3.0 million bales, equal to 20 percent of total use, which is well below the previous 10-year average.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers is 68.0 to 88.0 cents per pound, compared with 72.0 cents estimated for 2012/13.The initial 2013/14 world cotton projections show world ending stocks of nearly 93 million bales, the third consecutive seasonal record, as China\u2019s policy of stockpiling cotton in its national reserve is assumed to continue.  World production is projected nearly 3 percent lower than 2012/13 at 117.8 million bales, as reductions, mainly for the United States, China, Turkey, Greece, and Mexico, are partially offset by increases for Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Australia.  World consumption is expected to rise 2 percent due to modest growth in world GDP.  World trade is expected to fall 12 percent, as sharply lower imports by China and India are partially offset by increases for Pakistan, Turkey, Mexico and others.  World ending stocks outside of China are projected to fall nearly 2.0 million bales.China\u2019s national reserve stocks are currently expected to reach nearly 40 million bales at the end of 2012/13.  Based on the government of China\u2019s current reserve purchase and release prices and import quota policies, USDA is projecting that China will import 12.0 million bales in 2013/14 and will add 10 million bales to ending stocks as reserve purchases exceed reserve sales.  The resulting projected China ending stocks of 58.2 million bales would account for 63 percent of world stocks. For 2012/13, the final U.S. crop production estimate of 17.3 million bales is virtually unchanged from last month.  U.S. exports are raised 250,000 bales, reflecting recent activity and stronger expected imports by China, which are raised 1.8 million bales from last month.  India\u2019s production and consumption also show significant increases.",
    "March_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean production is projected at 3,929 million bushels, down slightly from last month due to a revision to South Carolina production.  U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 460 million bushels, up 10 million from last month due to a lower crush.  Soybean trade projections are unchanged.  Crush is reduced 10 million bushels to 1,870 million reflecting a lower projection for soybean meal domestic disappearance.  Soybean meal imports are raised slightly, partly offsetting lower meal production.  Despite a lower crush, soybean oil ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected up 120 million pounds from last month to 2,185 million as higher beginning stocks and a lower export forecast more than offset lower production.  Higher beginning stocks reflect a revision to soybean oil stocks for 2014/15 as reported in the March 1 Oilseed Crushings 2015 Summary report.  Soybean and soybean meal prices are reduced this month and the projected ranges are narrowed.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2015/16 is projected at $8.25 to $9.25 per bushel, down 5 cents at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price is projected at $270 to $300 per short ton, down $5 at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 28.5 to 31.5 cents pound, unchanged from last month.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 526.9 million tons, down fractionally from last month.  Global soybean production is projected at 320.2 million tons, down slightly from last month.  Other oilseed production changes include reduced rapeseed production for Australia, higher peanut production for India, lower palm kernel production for Malaysia, and lower cottonseed production for India and Pakistan.  Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is projected at 149.3 million tons, up 1.2 million mainly reflecting increased soybean exports for Brazil.  The soybean import forecast for China is raised reflecting strong imports to date.  Partially offsetting are reduced imports for the EU, Pakistan, and Mexico, where more imports of soybean meal are expected.  Global oilseed crush is projected higher reflecting larger soybean crush in Argentina and China.  The forecasts for peanut crush in India and rapeseed crush in the EU are also projected higher.  Reduced forecasts for cottonseed crush in India, Pakistan, and the United States are partly offsetting.  Argentina soybean meal exports are raised with a larger crush forecast.  Soybean meal imports are increased for the EU, Pakistan, Mexico, and South Korea.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 89.5 million tons, down 1.7 million from last month, mostly due to lower soybean ending stock projections for Argentina and Brazil.  Global vegetable oil production is nearly unchanged this month as higher soybean oil and peanut oil production more than offset lower palm oil production in Malaysia.  Global vegetable oil stocks are projected at 16.5 million tons, down marginally from last month.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar beginning stocks for 2015/16 are increased by 40,990 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on refiners\u2019 corrected data for 2014/15 as published in Sweetener Market Data. U.S. sugar production for 2015/16 is projected at 8.827 million STRV, a decrease of 21,901. Florida cane sugar is decreased 27,492 STRV to 2.108 million.  While Florida cane processors have produced only 1.084 million STRV through January due to difficult harvest conditions, no processor has forecast reduced sugarcane production, with all maintaining that the harvest will be extended by at least a month to meet all individual processor sugarcane production goals.  The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) forecasts Florida sugarcane for sugar at 16.974 million tons.  Based on refiner projections, sucrose recovery will be lower by 2.5 percent due to the extended harvest.  Cane sugar production levels for all other States are unchanged from last month.  Beet sugar production is increased by a small 5,591 STRV to 5.016 million as reduced beet pile shrink is partially offset by lower expected sucrose recovery.On March 7, 2016, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) provided notice of a reallocation of 85,533 metric tons, raw value (MTRV) of the 2015/16 raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) from countries unable to fill their original allocations to the other countries capable of filling.  As a consequence, the raw sugar TRQ shortfall is revised downward from 99,208 STRV to 27,558, a reduction of 71,650.  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 33,424 STRV to 1.299 million.Exports to Mexico for 2015/16 are expected to be lower by 23,476 STRV.  Also, since last month, U.S. cane sugar refiners have become more pessimistic about generating export alternatives after Mexico banned duty-free imports of U.S. sugar benefitting from the re-export import program.  Sugar exports are, therefore, projected at 100,000 STRV. No other changes to sugar use were made.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1.646 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.For the 2015/16 Mexico sugar supply and use balance, imports are decreased by 20,092 MT to match the decrease in U.S. exports to Mexico.  Mexico exports are projected at 1.122 million MT, a decrease of 28,606 from last month.  Exports to the United States are projected at 1.112 million MT, based on changes made in the March 2016 WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d). For the 2015/16 Mexico sugar supply and use balance, imports are decreased by 20,092 MT to match the decrease in U.S. exports to Mexico.  Mexico exports are projected at 1.122 million MT, a decrease of 28,606 from last month.  Exports to the United States are projected at 1.112 million MT, based on changes made in the March 2016 WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d). LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2016 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher forecast first-quarter broiler and turkey production more than offsets small reductions in beef and pork.  First-quarter beef production is reduced on the pace of slaughter and lower carcass weights; pork production is reduced on slightly lighter carcass weights.  Broiler and turkey production for the first quarter is raised as the pace of slaughter to date has been higher than expected.  The egg production forecast is raised on increased table egg production as the sector continues to rebuild following last year\u2019s Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreaks.  Historical poultry and egg production estimates are adjusted to reflect revisions in production data. Beef import and export forecasts are unchanged from last month.  The pork export forecast is lowered from last month on recent trade data.  The pork import forecast is raised on expectations of relatively large exportable supplies in the EU and continued strength of the U.S. dollar.  Broiler export and turkey export forecasts are lowered on slower-than-expected sales in January.Annual cattle and hog prices for 2016 are unchanged from last month.  Broiler prices are lowered on current prices and expected higher production.  The turkey price forecast is unchanged but the range is narrowed.  Egg prices are reduced on higher forecast production. The milk production forecast for 2016 is lowered from last month as a smaller decline in the cowherd is more than offset by slower growth in milk per cow.  Fat and skim-solids basis exports are reduced primarily on strong competition in international whey product markets, and exports of a number of other dairy products are facing increased competition.  Imports are increased on both a fat and skim-solids basis.  Continued strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to keep the United States as an attractive market for dairy products.  Expectations of a relatively wide spread between U.S. and international butter prices will support increased butterfat imports while cheese imports will likely benefit from continued demand strength.  Whey product exports are also likely to be pressured by large world supplies. \u00a0The butter price forecast is raised as demand remains firm.  Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are reduced as supplies are expected to be large and in the case of NDM, international prices will remain under pressure from large global supplies.  The whey price forecast is unchanged.  The Class III price is lowered on the lower cheese price. The Class IV price is unchanged at the midpoint as the higher butter price offsets a lower NDM price; however, the range is narrowed.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $14.95 to $15.55 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2015/16 cotton supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month.  Marginal adjustments in harvested area and yield reflect NASS\u2019s resurvey of the South Carolina crop.  The marketing year average price received by producers is now estimated to range from 58.0 to 60.0 cents per pound, with the midpoint of 59.0 cents reduced from the February estimate due to declining market prices.With lower consumption partially offsetting lower production, global 2015/16 cotton ending stocks are revised down this month.  Production is estimated lower in India and Pakistan, based on arrivals at gins, but higher in Australia.  The 1.0-million-bale reduction in India\u2019s crop reflects an early withdrawal of monsoon rainfall combined with pest damage in the northern states.  Consumption is reduced mainly in Pakistan, based on lower available supplies.  World ending stocks are now projected at 103.3 million bales.",
    "March_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2016/17 include higher crush, lower exports, and increased ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s report.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,940 million on increased domestic soybean meal disappearance.  Soybean exports are reduced 25 million bushels to 2,025 million with increased production and exports for Brazil.  Soybean stocks are projected at 435 million bushels, up 15 million from last month.  With increased crush, soybean oil production, exports, and ending stocks are forecast higher.The season-average soybean price range forecast of $9.30 to $9.90 per bushel is raised 10 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 32 to 35 cents per pound, down 2 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are unchanged at $310 to $340 per short ton.The 2016/17 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed supplies are raised 3.2 million tons to 646.9 million mainly on a 4-million-ton increase to the Brazilian soybean crop, which is projected at a record 108 million tons.  The crop has benefited from favorable weather with ample rainfall throughout the growing season, raising the prospects for record yields.  Also adding to oilseed supplies are increases to rapeseed production in Australia and sunflowerseed in Turkey and Serbia.  Global oilseed exports are raised 1.4 million tons from last month mostly on a 1.0-million-ton increase to soybean exports.  Higher soybean shipments for Brazil and Paraguay offset lower U.S. exports.  Parallel to higher exports is a 1-million-ton increase to Chinese soybean imports reaching a record 87 million tons.  Forecast global oilseed stocks are raised 2.6 million tons to 94.3 million mainly on higher soybean stocks, which are increased 2.5 million tons for Brazil, China, and the United States combined.  Production changes to oilseed products include increased meals and lower vegetable oils.  Higher oilseed meal is mainly driven by increased soybean meal production for Brazil, the United States, and Thailand.  Global vegetable oil production is lowered 0.6 million tons mostly on a reduction in palm oil for Malaysia and Colombia. SUGAR:  U.S. fiscal year 2016/17 beet sugar production is decreased 265,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.106 million.  Sucrose recovery from sugarbeet slicing reported by processors in the Sweetener Market Data (SMD) for the period covering the 6 months between August 2016 and January 2017 of this year\u2019s sugarbeet harvest cycle imply a final crop year recovery projection from slicing at 13.9 percent, much less than the 14.7 percent underlying previous projections based on historical averages.  Projected imports of sugar from Mexico for 2016/17 are increased by 189,780 STRV to 1.162 million, and projected tariff-rate quota imports (TRQ) are increased by 44,093 STRV to 1.576 million based on USDA\u2019s increase of the specialty sugar TRQ, announced on February 24.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2016/17 are increased by 100,000 STRV to 12.100 million based on strong deliveries in the first 4 months of the fiscal year and a continuation of that growth, but at a reduced rate for the remainder of the year.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.677 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.6 percent.  Included in ending stocks are 12,476 STRV of sugar recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau as imported from Mexico in 2016/17 but which entered under a 2015/16 Mexico export license.For Mexico, exports to the United States for 2016/17 are projected at 994,502 metric tons (MT), based on changes made in the March 2017 WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  The ending stock total for 2016/17 is forecast at 1.278 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 426,354 MT.  Total exports are 1.421 million MT, the sum of projected exports to the United States and to other countries.For Mexico, exports to the United States for 2016/17 are projected at 994,502 metric tons (MT), based on changes made in the March 2017 WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  The ending stock total for 2016/17 is forecast at 1.278 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 426,354 MT.  Total exports are 1.421 million MT, the sum of projected exports to the United States and to other countries.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. meat production for 2017 is increased from the previous month as higher forecast beef production more than offsets lower forecast pork and turkey production.  The broiler production forecast is unchanged from the previous month.  First quarter beef production is raised on current slaughter data, and third-quarter production is raised as higher expected first quarter placements are marketed in the second half of the year.  However, carcass weights for the year are forecast lower as feedlot operators are expected to remain current in their marketings.  The pork production forecast is slightly lower as a result of lighter carcass weights in the first half of the year.  USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report March 30th, providing an indication of producer intentions for farrowings in the next 2 quarters.  Small changes are made to 2016 poultry production estimates, reflecting recent data revisions.  For 2017, the turkey production forecast is decreased on slower expected second-half production growth.  Egg production estimates for 2015 and 2016 reflect recent NASS revisions.  Forecast egg production is increased. The forecast for 2017 beef imports is unchanged, but the export forecast is raised on stronger-than-expected export shipments thus far in the quarter.  Pork imports are lowered for 2017, reflecting larger domestic supplies and limited demand for foreign product.  Forecast pork exports are raised on robust international demand and large domestic supplies of pork.  No change is made to broiler and turkey trade forecasts.  The egg export forecast is reduced as South Korea\u2019s ban on imports of U.S. poultry and products, due to the recent Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreak in the United States, limits expected export growth.  Cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts for 2017 are raised from last month on continued demand strength.  The 2017 turkey price forecast is lowered as the first-quarter price forecast is reduced.  Egg price forecasts are lowered from last month on current price movements.  The 2017 milk production forecast is raised as milk cow numbers are expected to increase more rapidly.  However, growth in milk per cow is reduced on January data.  Dairy exports on a fat basis for 2017 are unchanged, while skim-solids basis exports are lowered on expected strong competition in international skim milk powder markets.  Both fat basis and skim-solids basis imports forecasts are unchanged.  Skim-solids basis ending stocks are forecast higher for 2017 on higher production of dairy products and weaker exports.  Fat-basis ending stocks are unchanged.  Historical milk production and stock estimates reflect recently released revisions.  The cheese price forecast for 2017 is reduced as stocks of cheese are high and are expected to pressure prices.  The butter price forecast is raised on continued demand strength.  The nonfat dry milk price is forecast lower on expectations of slower export growth due to increased competition from global competitors.  The whey price forecast is raised reflecting recent market strength.  The Class III price is raised as the higher whey price more than outweighs the reduced cheese price.  The Class IV price forecast is lowered, reflecting a weaker nonfat dry milk price which more than offsets a higher forecast butter price.  The all milk price for 2017 is forecast at $17.80 to $18.40 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. cotton forecasts show higher production and exports relative to last month.  Production is raised 271,000 bales to 17.2 million based on the March 9 Cotton Ginnings report.  The final estimates for this season\u2019s U.S. area, yield, and production will be published in the May 2017 Crop Production report.  Domestic mill use is unchanged from last month, but exports are raised 0.5 million bales to 13.2 million based on recent very strong sales and shipments.  U.S. exports are projected to capture nearly 37 percent of world trade, a 7-year high.  Ending stocks are lowered 300,000 bales to 4.5 million.   The projected range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 67.0 to 70.0 cents per pound is reduced 1 cent on the upper end, as the reported average price for January fell below previous expectations.The forecast 2016/17 global production is raised slightly this month due to the revision in the United States, while world consumption is virtually unchanged.  Consumption is raised for Indonesia and Vietnam and reduced for Turkey and other countries.  World beginning stocks are raised marginally due to higher estimated 2015/16 production in Australia.  Forecast world trade is raised slightly, with imports and exports revised for several countries based on activity to date.  World ending stocks are now projected at 90.5 million bales, nearly 600,000 bales above last month.",
    "February_2021": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s 2020/21 U.S. soybean outlook is for increased exports and lower ending stocks.  Soybean exports are projected at 2.25 billion bushels, up 20 million from last month reflecting record marketing-year exports through January and a slow start to Brazil\u2019s export season resulting from harvest delays.  With crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks are reduced 20 million bushels to 120 million.  If realized, soybean ending stocks would be down 77 percent from 2019/20, and the lowest since 2013/14.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is forecast at $11.15 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $400.00 per short ton, up 10 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is raised 1.5 cents to 40.0 cents per pound.Global 2020/21 soybean supply and demand forecasts include higher exports and lower ending stocks.  Global exports are raised 0.6 million tons to 169.7 million on higher exports from the United States and Russia.  Higher imports for Argentina are partially offset by reductions for the EU-27+UK, Canada, and Bangladesh.  Global soybean stocks are reduced 1.0 million tons to 83.4 million as lower stocks in the United States and Brazil more than offset higher stocks in Argentina.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is increased 215,644 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.333 million on projected increases in production and imports.  Beet sugar production is increased 53,778 STRV to 5.046 million on a projected increase in national sucrose recovery to 15.126 percent.  Recoveries in all regions except the Upper Midwest are projected to be at historically high levels, pushing the national recovery projection 1.19 standard deviations above its 8-year average since 2012/13.  Although beet pile shrink has been a concern in most regions, processors\u2019 data collected through January has yet to suggest an adjustment at this time.  Industry data indicate that crop year 2020/21 cane sugar production in Louisiana has set a record of 1.957 million STRV.  With adjustments made for production occurring in September, the fiscal year estimate is 1.931 million STRV.  The campaign was extended into January, resulting in record production for the month estimated at 197,000 STRV.  This amount is 44,850 STRV above the level projected in the WASDE last month.  Cane sugar production in Florida is increased by 65,000 STRV to 2.200 million on processors\u2019 reporting of increased area harvested along with a smaller increase in cane yield.  Cane sugar production in Texas is reduced 7,984 STRV to 134,000 on a processor-reported drop off in late-season yields.  High-tier tariff imports are increased 60,000 STRV to 170,000.  The increase reflects the strong pace set in the first quarter of the fiscal year and oversubscribed imports of organic sugar beyond remaining tranche levels that are being stored in bonded warehouses.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected residually at 1.993 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 16.15 percent.  After the publication of the sugar WASDE next month, the Commerce Department will determine a new export limit for sugar from Mexico.  That calculation will be set at the larger of (a) U.S. Needs as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreement or (b) the export limit set by Commerce in December 2020 of 927,920 STRV.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is increased 215,644 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.333 million on projected increases in production and imports.

The 2021 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month on higher forecast beef, pork, and broiler production.  The beef production forecast is raised from the previous month primarily on higher cattle slaughter and heavier-than-expected early-year cattle weights.  Pork production is raised on higher expected hog slaughter as well as heavier carcass weights in the first half of the year.  Broiler production is raised slightly from the previous month.  Production in the first quarter of the year is forecast higher on hatchery and preliminary slaughter data, but growth in second half production is slowed due to higher expected feed costs.  The turkey production forecast is unchanged.  Forecast egg production is reduced from last month as higher feed costs are expected to temper production growth.  Livestock, poultry, and egg trade estimates for 2020 are adjusted to reflect December trade data.  For 2021, the beef export forecast is raised on strong demand for U.S. beef in several markets.  The turkey export forecast is reduced from last month on slower international demand.  Pork, broiler, and egg export forecasts remain unchanged from last month.  Fed-cattle prices are lowered for the second half of the year on increased production, while the annual hog price forecast is raised from last month on expectations of firm demand.  Broiler and egg price forecasts are raised on current prices and expected slower growth of production later in the year.  Turkey prices are raised on stronger expected demand.  The 2020 milk production, trade, and stock estimates are adjusted to reflect December data.  For 2021, the milk production forecast is raised from last month, primarily on higher dairy cow numbers.  The 2021 fat basis import forecast is raised on higher expected imports of cheese and butterfat products, while exports are raised on higher shipments of butterfat.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is unchanged while the export forecast is raised, reflecting expectations of strong international demand.  Annual product price forecasts for cheese and butter are lowered from the previous month on current prices, increased production, and larger stocks.  Nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey price forecasts are raised from last month on firm demand.  The Class III price is reduced on the lower cheese price forecast and the Class IV price is also reduced, reflecting a lower butter price forecast.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is reduced to $17.15 per cwt. COTTON:  The 2020/21 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show slightly higher exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  The export forecast is raised 250,000 bales to 15.5 million based on a strong pace of shipments to date.  Ending stocks are now estimated at 4.3 million bales, equivalent to 24 percent of total disappearance.  The upland cotton marketing year average price received by producers is projected at 68 cents per pound, unchanged from January.The 2020/21 world cotton forecasts include higher production, consumption, and imports, led by changes in China.  World production is projected 1.3 million bales higher this month, with China\u2019s forecast raised by 1.5 million bales as the daily rates of both ginnings and inspections in Xinjiang continue to show unusual late-season strength.  Reports from China continue to suggest 2020/21 cotton area in Xinjiang was little changed from last year, but government classing data now indicates yields could be about 10 percent higher, while lower in Eastern China.  India\u2019s production estimate is reduced 500,000 bales on increasing evidence of pest infestation, while Pakistan is 200,000 bales higher and Australia 100,000 bales higher.  World consumption is projected 1.5 million bales higher this month, with China\u2019s forecast 1.0 million bales higher reflecting growing domestic textile demand and exports.  Much smaller increases are also included for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Turkey, while the outlook this month is for lower consumption in Indonesia and Thailand.  World trade is projected 350,000 bales higher than last month, with imports 500,000 bales higher for China, and smaller, partially offsetting changes elsewhere.  World ending stocks are almost 600,000 bales lower this month, at 95.7 million bales, 3.2 million bales lower than in 2019/20.  ",
    "April_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supplies for 2013/14 are projected at 3.49 billion bushels, up 30 million on increased imports.  Imports are projected at a record 65 million bushels based on trade reported through February and prospective large shipments from South America during the second half of the marketing year.  Soybean exports for 2013/14 are increased 50 million bushels to 1.58 billion reflecting record year-to-date shipments and large outstanding sales.  Despite relatively high prices and record harvests in South America, U.S. exports have remained strong, especially to China, where imports from the United States have already exceeded the previous marketing-year record.  Soybean crush is reduced 5 million bushels to 1.685 billion with lower domestic soybean meal consumption more than offsetting a small increase in projected soybean meal exports.  Seed use is raised in line with the record plantings reported in the March 31 Prospective Plantings report, while residual use is reduced based on indications from the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  U.S. soybean ending stocks are projected at 135 million bushels, down 10 million from last month.Projected prices for soybeans and soybean products are all raised this month.  The projected range for the season-average soybean price is raised 5 cents at the midpoint to 12.50 to $13.50 per bushel.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 38 to 40 cents per pound, up 1.5 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $460 to $490 per short ton, up 5 dollars at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 504.5 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month with lower soybean production mostly offsetting increases for other crops.  Global soybean production is projected at 284.0 million tons, down 1.4 million from last month but still a record.  Brazil soybean production is forecast at 87.5 million tons, down 1.0 million from last month with higher harvested area more than offset by lower yields.  Lower yields primarily reflect the effect of warm temperatures and limited rainfall through mid-February in the south.  India soybean production is reduced 0.8 million tons to 11.0 million reflecting lower-than-average yields resulting from excessive rainfall during much of the growing season.  Changes for other crops include higher rapeseed production for India and the European Union, increased sunflowerseed production for Russia, and increased peanut production for Argentina, Brazil, and India.Global oilseed supplies, exports, and crush for 2013/14 are projected higher this month while ending stocks are projected lower.  Higher rapeseed crush in China and higher sunflowerseed crush in Argentina and Russia more than offset reduced soybean crush in the United States, Brazil, and India.  Global oilseed stocks are projected at 82.6 million tons, down 1.4 million.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 73,000 short tons, raw value (STRV), from last month, as a result of lower production and slightly lower beginning stocks.  Sugar production is projected down 71,000 STRV, based on processor reports, with 41,000 of the decline from beet sugar and 30,000 from cane sugar.  The 2,000 STRV reduction in 2013/14 beginning stocks reflects minor adjustments to estimated 2012/13 cane sugar production and deliveries for food.  Projected 2013/14 use is unchanged from March indications.  The net reduction in projected 2013/14 ending stocks of 73,000 STRV brings the stocks-to-use ratio down to 13.0 percent, from 13.6 percent projected in March.Supply and use estimates for Mexico for 2012/13 and projections for 2013/14 are unchanged this month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2014 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as higher beef production is more than offset by lower pork, broiler, and turkey production.  For beef, production is forecast higher as lower forecast slaughter in the first quarter is more than offset by higher slaughter in the second half.  The larger forecast second-half slaughter reflects larger placements of cattle during the first half.  Pork production is reduced from last month as the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated a year-over decline in the December-February 2014 pig crop and revised the June-August 2013 pig crop lower.  Although producers indicated intentions to increase sows farrowing in March-May and June-August 2014, the loss of piglets due to the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus is expected to result in lower slaughter during the remainder of the year.  Although carcass weights are forecast higher, those gains will be insufficient to offset the reduced slaughter numbers and the pork production forecast is reduced from last month.  Broiler production and hatchery data points to slower growth in eggs set and chicks placed. Production is also reduced as feed prices are forecast higher.  Turkey production for the first quarter is reduced based on February production, but forecasts for production in subsequent quarters are unchanged.  Egg production forecasts for 2014 are unchanged. The beef import forecast for 2014 is raised from last month as demand for processing-grade beef remains strong and the export forecast is raised on continued strong sales to Asian markets.  Pork imports are raised on high U.S. pork prices, but the export forecast is reduced as tighter supplies and high prices are expected to constrain sales.  The broiler export forecast is reduced based on February export data.  Turkey exports are lowered on weaker sales.  Egg import and export forecasts are lowered. Cattle prices for 2014 are raised from last month, reflecting continued price strength for fed cattle. The hog price forecast is raised on current prices and expected tight supplies of market hogs. Broiler and turkey prices are raised as higher cattle and reduced broiler production support higher prices.  The egg price is raised on continued strong demand. The milk production forecast for 2014 is raised from last month as strong returns are expected to encourage a more rapid expansion in cow numbers and increased milk per cow.  Fat-basis exports are raised on higher sales of cheese and butter, but the skim-solids export forecast is lowered on weaker-than-expected nonfat dry milk (NDM) sales.  Skim-solid imports are reduced slightly due to lower imports of milk protein concentrate and casein.  \u00a0Product price forecasts for cheese, butter, and whey are higher, supported by strong demand and price strength to date.  However, the NDM price is unchanged at the midpoint as export demand is weaker than expected.  Class III and Class IV prices are raised on higher product prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $22.55-23.05 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2013/14 U.S. cotton estimates include lower production and ending stocks compared with last month.  Production is reduced 320,000 bales to 12.9 million based on USDA\u2019s final Cotton Ginnings report, released March 25.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  Ending stocks are reduced to 2.5 million bales, which is the smallest stock level since 1990/91.  The stocks-to-use ratio of 17.5 percent is the smallest since 2010/11.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is now forecast at 76 to 79 cents per pound, up 1 cent on both ends of the range, reflecting recent higher market prices.This month\u2019s world cotton 2013/14 estimates feature a 1.0-million-bale increase in expected imports by China, based on stronger-than-expected imports to date and the likely release of new import quotas.  World production is reduced marginally as the decrease for the United States is mostly offset by increases for Brazil, Burkina Faso, and others.  Slight historical revisions are made for Australia beginning in 2000/01 based on a review of data sources.  World trade is raised 1.2 million bales, as increases in imports by China, Pakistan, and Vietnam are partially offset by reductions for India and Indonesia.  Exports are raised for Australia, India, and Burkina Faso, but are lowered for Brazil and Pakistan.  World stocks are raised marginally.",
    "January_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is estimated at 117.4 million tons, up 0.3 million from last month.  Larger crops for soybeans, peanuts, and cottonseed are partly offset by reductions for sunflowerseed and canola.  Soybean production is estimated at 3,969 million bushels, up 11 million bushels with lower harvested area more than offset with increased yields.  Harvested area is estimated at 83.1 million acres, down 0.3 million from the previous forecast.  The soybean yield is estimated at 47.8 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels from last month.  Soybean exports are increased 10 million bushels to 1,770 million reflecting record exports during the first quarter of the marketing year.  Soybean ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 410 million bushels, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal balance sheet changes include increased imports and domestic consumption.  Soybean oil balance sheet changes include reduced production on a lower extraction rate and lower domestic use for biodiesel.The 2014/15 U.S. season-average farm price for soybeans is projected at $9.45 to $10.95 per bushel, up 20 cents at the midpoint based on prices reported to date.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 31 to 35 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price projection is unchanged at $340 to $380 per short ton.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 532.4 million tons, up 1.6 million on increases for soybeans, sunflowerseed, rapeseed, and peanuts.  Global soybean production is projected at 314.4 million tons, up 1.6 million on gains for Brazil and the United States.  The Brazil soybean crop projection is raised 1.5 million tons to a record 95.5 million.  The increase is based on higher projected yields for major producing states including Mato Grosso and Parana.  Soybean production is reduced for India on lower yields reflecting late planting and a short monsoon season.  Several years of historical revisions are also made for India soybean production.  Other changes include increased soybean production for Bolivia, increased soybean and sunflowerseed production for EU, and reduced cottonseed production for India.Global oilseed trade for 2014/15 is projected at 135.7 million tons, up 0.4 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports for the United States and increased rapeseed export prospects for Canada account for most of the change.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 104.7 million tons, up 0.6 million on increased soybean stocks in Brazil which are partly offset by lower soybean stocks in EU and lower canola stocks in Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. 2014/15 total sugar supply is decreased 9,412 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month to 13.910 million.  With no change to beginning stocks or production, the change in supply is attributable to a net reduction in imports.  Imports from Mexico are decreased by 22,419 STRV to 1.602 million.  This total is based on the Target Quantity of U.S. Needs defined in the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico, effective December 19, 2014.  This agreement is assumed to be part of official U.S. government policy limiting sugar imports from Mexico.  Imports entering under the Caribbean/Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement are increased 13,007 STRV, increasing total sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) imports to 1.492 million.  Total imports are 3.504 million STRV.  There are no changes to total use.  Ending stocks are calculated residually at 1.666 million STRV. The implied stocks-to-use ratio is 13.6 percent, slightly less than last month\u2019s 13.7 percent.Mexico 2014/15 production is increased by 11,372 metric tons (MT) to 6.151 million based on the first production estimate from Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (Conadesuca).  The 2014/15 projection represents an increase over last year of 130,080 MT, or 2.2 percent.  Exports are decreased by 19,187 MT to 1.696 million MT.  The current projection is the sum of exports of 1.371 million MT to the United States, and 325,000 MT to other countries.  Ending stocks are calculated residually at 954,559 MT, implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 22.7 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production for 2015 is raised from last month on increased beef and pork production.  Poultry production forecasts are unchanged.  Beef production is raised on higher carcass weights.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated farrowings increased 3 percent in September-November 2014 and that producers intend to expand farrowings by 4 percent during December-May 2015.  The report also showed that pigs per litter was record high for the September-November period; continued growth in pigs per litter is expected during 2015, resulting in greater availability of hogs for slaughter.  However, the increase in the number of slaughter hogs may be partly offset by lower weights as hogs are marketed more rapidly.  For 2014, the total meat production estimate is raised on higher pork and broiler production.  Beef production is reduced on a slightly slower pace of slaughter. The forecasts for 2014 and 2015 beef imports are raised, but the export forecast is reduced for 2014.  Pork exports for 2014 are reduced on the pace of shipments, but the forecast is unchanged for 2015.  No change is made to imports.  Broiler exports are reduced slightly for 2015.  No change is made to the turkey export forecasts.   The cattle price forecasts for 2015 are reduced from last month.  The hog price forecast for 2015 is lowered on larger supplies.  Broiler prices are lowered for 2015 as supplies of competing meats pressure prices.  No change is made to turkey or egg prices.  Prices for 2014 are adjusted to incorporate December data.The milk production estimate for 2014 and the forecast for 2015 are lowered from last month on slower growth in cow numbers and milk per cow.  Skim-solids export forecasts are raised for 2014 and 2015 primarily on stronger sales of whey and nonfat dry milk.  Fat basis exports are unchanged for 2014 but slightly higher in 2015.  Ending stocks for 2014 are raised as domestic demand has been weaker than expected.    Dairy product prices for 2015 are reduced as carry-in stocks are higher and supplies remain relatively large, especially in the first half of the year.  However, demand is expected to strengthen later in the year with lower price levels, limiting further price declines.  The Class III and Class IV prices for 2015 are lowered on weaker product prices.  The all milk price is lowered to $17.75-18.55 per cwt for 2015.COTTON:  The 2014/15 U.S. cotton estimates include slightly larger production and ending stocks.  Production is raised 161,000 bales, as the crop is estimated higher in all regions except the Southeast.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged, resulting in estimated ending stocks of 4.7 million bales.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average price received by producers of 59.5 to 63.5 cents per pound is narrowed 0.5 cents on both ends, with the midpoint unchanged at 61.5 cents.The 2014/15 world cotton estimates show small revisions from last month.  Total world production is marginally higher, as increases for Pakistan, the United States, and Tanzania are mostly offset by a decrease for India.  Global consumption is reduced nearly 400,000 bales, as a decrease for China is partially offset by increases for Sudan and Zimbabwe.  China\u2019s consumption is lowered as mills\u2019 response to falling domestic cotton prices continues to be sluggish and yarn imports to date remain high.  World trade is reduced marginally based on decreases in Pakistan\u2019s imports and India\u2019s exports.  World ending stocks are now projected at 108.6 million bales.",
    "October_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 116.3 million tons, up 0.1 million from last month.  Soybean production is forecast at a record 3,927 million bushels, up 14 million with improved yields more than offsetting reduced harvested area.  The soybean yield is projected at 47.1 bushels per acre, up 0.5 bushels from September.  Harvested area is reduced 0.7 million acres to 83.4 million.  Soybean supplies for 2014/15 are projected 24 million bushels below last month with lower beginning stocks from the Grain Stocks report more than offsetting increased production.  Canola, sunflower, and cottonseed production are forecast lower this month while peanut production is forecast slightly higher.  U.S. soybean exports and crush for 2014/15 are unchanged this month.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 450 million bushels, down 25 million on reduced supplies.  Prices for soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal are unchanged.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 528.4 million tons, up 0.4 million from last month as higher soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production more than offset reduced sunflowerseed and rapeseed production.  Global soybean production is projected at 311.2 million tons, up 0.1 million.  Small reductions in soybean production for China and Russia partly offset increases for the United States and EU.  Rapeseed production is reduced for Canada based on lower yields reported in the most recent survey from Statistics Canada.  Rapeseed production is increased to a record 23.5 million tons for EU.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced on lower estimates for both Argentina and Russia.  Other changes include increased cottonseed production for China, India, and Pakistan.Global oilseed stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 103.6 million, a 29 percent increase from 2013/14.  Oilseed stocks are virtually unchanged from last month as lower rapeseed stocks in Canada offset an increase in soybean stocks.  Higher soybean stocks in Argentina offset a reduction in the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. 2013/14 sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) imports are reduced by 72,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on end of year reporting by the U.S. Customs Service.  Imports from Mexico are decreased by 12,000 STRV to 2.124 million with almost all import data in for the fiscal year.  Texas cane sugar production is reduced by 2,000 STRV based on revised processor data.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are reduced by 86,000 STRV to 1.810 million, implying an ending stocks-to-use of 14.5 percent.  For 2014/15, imports from Mexico are increased by 461,000 STRV to 1.549 million.  Beet sugar production is increased 170,000 STRV to 4.970 million based on analysis of National Agricultural Statistics Service data.  Cane sugar is reduced 19,000 STRV to 3.572 million based on processors\u2019 reporting.  As a residual, ending stocks are increased by 526,000 STRV to 1.554 million for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.8 percent, up 4.3 percentage points over last month.For Mexico in 2013/14, imports are reduced by 96,000 metric tons (MT), all of which were intended for Mexico\u2019s re-export program (IMMEX) for sugar-containing products.  In a mostly parallel adjustment in use, deliveries to the IMMEX are reduced by that same 96,000 MT, plus 10,000 MT from reductions in domestic sourcing, based on pace to date.  Deliveries for consumption are reduced by 50,000 MT after a fall-off in late season domestic shipments.  Total deliveries are, therefore, decreased by 156,000 MT.  Based on U.S. import data, exports to the United States are decreased by 11,000 MT. Based on adjustments to data, exports to non-U.S. destinations are increased by 1,000 MT (681,000 total) and production is increased by 1,000 MT (6.021 million total).  These changes imply ending stocks at 685,000 MT, for a stocks-to-consumption ratio of 16.5 percent.  For 2014/15, total Mexico supply is increased by 71,000 MT in beginning stocks.  Deliveries for consumption are decreased by 52,000 MT in line with the reduction made for 2013/14.  Ending stocks are still forecast at 22 percent of consumption for an 11,000 MT reduction to 936,000 MT.  Because total exports are forecast as a residual, their change is equal to the sum of the other changes (positive for supply, negative for use), or 134,000 MT, for a total of 1.650 million.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations based on contracts are reduced by 260,000 MT to 325,000.  FEESA, the entity which runs the nine government-owned mills in Mexico, announced that it had renegotiated one earlier contract and is committed to export 40,000 MT instead of the earlier negotiated 300,000 MT.  As a consequence, exports to the United States are residually calculated at 1.325 million MT, up 394,000 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2014 and 2015 are raised from last month.  For both 2014 and 2015, the increase in beef production is driven by heavier carcass weights as lower corn prices encourage producers to market heavier cattle.  Pork production in 2014 is reduced from last month as slower gains in carcass weights in the second half of the year more than offset higher expected fourth-quarter slaughter.  For 2015, the production forecast is raised.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated that the decline in third-quarter pigs per litter was less than during the first half of the year.  With higher indicated farrowing intentions for the last quarter of 2014 and into 2015, and slightly more rapid forecast recovery in pigs per liter, it is expected that a greater number of hogs will be available for slaughter during 2015.  Increased pork production will also be supported by higher carcass weights.  Broiler productions for 2014 is unchanged, but lower forecast feed costs are expected to encourage more rapid production growth in 2015.  Turkey production for 2014 is slightly higher based on production data to date; however, the production forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Egg production is raised for both 2014 and 2015, reflecting revisions to table egg production estimates.  Forecasts for 2014 and 2015 beef imports are unchanged from last month.  Beef exports for 2014 are lowered based on recent trade data, but the forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Pork imports are unchanged for 2014, but are reduced for 2015 as U.S. production is forecast higher and prices lower.  Pork exports are forecast higher on strong demand in 2014 and more competitive prices in 2015.  Broiler exports are raised for 2014 on current strength of demand, but the 2015 forecast is unchanged.  Turkey export forecasts are raised for 2014 and 2015.   The cattle price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged from last month.  The hog price forecast for 2014 is unchanged, but the 2015 price is lowered on larger supplies.  The broiler price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised on robust demand.  The turkey price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged.  The egg price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged.  The milk production forecast for 2014 is reduced from last month on slower growth in milk per cow.  However, for 2015, the production forecast is raised as growth in output per cow is expected higher with relatively lower-priced feed.  Export forecasts for 2014 are lowered as U.S. dairy prices are less competitive, but import forecasts are raised as relatively high U.S. prices encourage larger imports. The trade forecasts for 2015 are unchanged. Butter, cheese, and whey prices for 2014 are raised from last month as domestic demand continues to support prices.  Prices of these products are unchanged for 2015.  However, the nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts for both 2014 and 2015 are reduced as U.S. prices are expected to decline to increase the competitiveness of NDM exports.  The Class III price for 2014 is raised on stronger cheese and whey prices, but is unchanged for 2015.  The Class IV price is raised for 2014 as higher butter prices more than offset the decline in NDM prices, but for 2015, the lower forecast NDM price results in a lower Class IV price.  The all milk price is raised to $24.10 to $24.20 per cwt for 2014, and is lowered for 2015 to $18.95 to $19.85 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2014/15 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates show lower production, ending stocks, and prices.  Production is reduced 283,000 bales to nearly 16.3 million.  The disappearance forecasts are unchanged.  The export forecast remains at 10.0 million bales, despite lower expected foreign imports, as demand for U.S. cotton is likely to be sustained.  The range for the marketing-year average price received by producers is lowered to 55 to 65 cents per pound; the midpoint of 60 cents per pound is reduced 4 cents on sharply lower recent prices, which followed announcements by the government of China indicating a more restrictive import policy.Global 2014/15 stocks are raised about 800,000 bales this month to 107 million, owing to higher beginning stocks, as increases for production and consumption are about offsetting.  Production is raised 1.4 million bales, including increases for China, India, and Pakistan, which are partly offset by reductions for Brazil, the United States, Australia, and Zimbabwe.  Forecast consumption by China is raised 1.5 million bales as mills there are expected to reduce yarn imports in favor of spinning domestic cotton.  Consumption also is raised for Indonesia, due to changes in the historical estimates series, and Vietnam, but is reduced for India.  World trade is reduced about 800,000 bales on lower imports by China.  Forecast stocks for India are raised sharply from last month due to a combination of higher production and lower offtake.  With China\u2019s stocks now projected to fall by 550,000 bales from last season, stocks outside of China are expected to rise 17 percent year-on-year to about 45 million bales.   World stocks for 2013/14 are raised 1.0 million bales, due mainly to higher production estimates for China and Brazil.  The China production estimate is raised 750,000 bales consistent with increased estimates of cotton which entered the national reserve.",
    "February_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2018/19 is estimated at 134.0 million tons, down 1.5 million from the previous report.  Smaller soybean, canola, peanut, and cottonseed crops are partly offset by an increase for sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is estimated at 4,544 million bushels, down 56 million.  Harvested area is estimated at 88.1 million acres, down fractionally from the previous report.  Yield is estimated at 51.6 bushels per acre, down 0.5 bushels, led by reductions for North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.  The soybean crush forecast is raised 10 million bushels to 2,090 million.  Soybean meal production is unchanged as the higher crush is offset by a lower extraction rate.  Lower supplies and increased crush are partly offset with a 25-million-bushel reduction in exports.  Ending stocks are projected at 910 million bushels, down 45 million from the previous forecast.The 2018/19 U.S. season-average farm price forecast for soybeans is projected at $8.10 to $9.10 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $295 to $335 per short ton, up $5.00 at the midpoint. The soybean oil price forecast of 28.5 to 31.5 cents per pound is unchanged at the midpoint.The 2018/19 global soybean outlook includes lower production, exports, crush, and stocks.  Global soybean production is lowered 8.2 million tons to 361.0 million with lower crops for Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and South Africa.  Production for Brazil is lowered 5 million tons to 117 million due to dryness in parts of the South and Center-West regions.  Production for Argentina is lowered 0.5 million tons to 55 million due to a reduction in harvested area that is partly offset by increased yields.  Global soybean exports are reduced 1.7 million tons to 154.4 million.  Lower exports for Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay are partly offset by higher exports for Argentina.  Global imports are also reduced mainly on a 2-million-ton reduction for China due to lower crush demand. Global 2018/19 soybean marketing-year ending stocks are lowered 8.6 million tons this month to 106.7 million, which is an 8.6-million-ton increase over the 2017/18 estimate.  In addition to crop-related changes, this month\u2019s lower global ending stocks forecast reflects historical balance sheet revisions for Argentina (back to 2009/10) and Brazil (back to 1999/00).  The revisions were motivated by supply and demand conditions indicating that beginning stock levels for the 2017/18 local year should be higher in Brazil and lower in Argentina than previously estimated.  Additionally, these revisions are more in line with historical stocks revisions made in late 2018 by Argentina\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Brazil\u2019s Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE).With Argentina\u2019s 2018 crop falling 30 percent below initial projections due to the drought, soybean stocks are assumed to be lower than prior estimates.  The post-drought stocks-to-use ratio had been projected at 38 percent for the 2017/18 local year (April 2018-March 2019).  The USDA\u2019s estimates are guided by Argentina\u2019s official crush, trade, and production data.  Projected stocks are reduced with upward revisions to residuals, which take into account supplies needed for reported use, statistical errors, and possible unreported demand during the past decade. While stocks are reduced for Argentina, Brazil\u2019s stocks are revised higher starting in 1999/00.  Record exports during October 2018-January 2019, the end of Brazil\u2019s 2017/18 local year (February 2018-January 2019), motivated the revisions.  Record late-season exports made it apparent that, in addition to a record crop, beginning stocks were higher than previously estimated.  Brazil\u2019s ending stocks were revised over several years to increase supplies in order to meet reported use through 2017/18.  For more information, read the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade and the Economic Research Service\u2019s Oil Crops Outlook February reports. SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2018/19 is unchanged at 4.900 million short tons, raw value (STRV) as an increase in projected sucrose recovery from sliced sugarbeets is offset by less sugarbeet production estimated by NASS.  Cane sugar production for 2018/19 in Louisiana is increased to 1.875 million STRV based on a reporting of cane processor manufacturing results completed in January.  Cane sugar production for Florida is increased to 2.091 million STRV based on higher sugarcane production forecast by NASS and a processor recovery forecast of 12.48 percent.  Beginning stocks for 2018/19 are increased 59,700 STRV based on cane processors\u2019 and refiners\u2019 revisions in the Sweetener Market Data.  Tariff-rate quota imports are reduced by 4,002 STRV.  Lower-than-expected entries of FTA sugar under calendar-year 2018 TRQs more than offset additional 2017/18 WTO TRQ sugar entered under USDA waivers in October 2018.  In sum, projected ending stocks are increased by 131,698 STRV to 1.795 million for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.59 percent.  There are no changes to the Mexico 2018/19 supply and use balance.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total red meat and poultry production for 2018 is lowered from December as beef and broiler production more than offsets slightly higher pork production.  Beef production is reduced on lower cattle slaughter and lighter carcass weights through late December.  Pork production is raised as heavier carcass weights through late December more than offset lower-than-expected fourth-quarter hog slaughter.  Broiler production is lowered while turkey production is unchanged.  Egg production is increased slightly for 2018. For 2019, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from December on lower expected beef, pork, and broiler production.  The 2019 beef production forecast is reduced on lower projected slaughter as smaller anticipated placements in late 2018 and early 2019 are expected to result in lower fed cattle marketings and slaughter in the first half of the year.  The pork production forecast for 2019 is lowered from December on lower expected hog slaughter and slightly lighter carcass weights in the first half of the year.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report estimated the September-November pig crop was 2 percent above 2017 and the report also indicated producers expect to expand farrowings about 2 percent in the first half of 2019.  Forecast broiler production is lowered for 2019 on slower expected production growth in the second half of the year.  The turkey production forecast is raised slightly. For 2018 and 2019, beef import and export forecasts are lowered from December on trade data to date.  Pork export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are reduced on the lowered forecast of production and slower expected pork shipments to key trading partners.  The 2018 and 2019 broiler and turkey export forecasts are raised on recent trade data and expectations of firm export demand carrying into next year.   Livestock, poultry and egg prices for 2018 are adjusted to reflect December price data.  Fed-cattle prices for the first quarter of 2019 are raised on current prices.  Hog prices are unchanged from December.  For 2019, first-half broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised on prices to date. Milk production for 2018 is lowered on available data through December.  The milk production forecast for 2019 is reduced on lower expected first-half dairy cow numbers and continued slow growth in milk per cow.  The 2018 and 2019 fat basis import forecasts are reduced from December on recent trade data and lower expected cheese and butterfat imports.  The fat basis exports are unchanged for 2018 but the forecast is raised for 2019 primarily on strong expected demand for butter and butterfat products.  On a skim-solids basis, the 2018 imports are raised on current trade data while the 2019 import forecast is unchanged.  Skim-solids basis exports for 2018 are lowered, but the 2019 export forecast is raised from December on anticipated strong demand for nonfat dry milk (NDM).Dairy product prices for 2018 are adjusted to reflect available December price data.  For 2019, the cheese price forecast is lowered while butter, NDM, and whey price forecasts are raised from December.  The Class III price for 2019 is unchanged from December while the Class IV price is raised on higher butter and NDM prices.  The 2019 all milk price forecast is raised to $16.90 to $17.60 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. cotton forecasts include slightly lower production, mill use, and ending stocks.  Production is reduced 200,000 bales due to small declines outside the Southeast.  Ending stocks and mill use are reduced 100,000 bales each, while exports are unchanged.  The forecast for the marketing-year average price received by producers is reduced 2 cents per pound, to a midpoint of 72 cents.The world 2018/19 cotton supply and demand estimates include lower production and mill use but higher trade and stocks.  Production is reduced nearly 300,000 bales, as smaller crops in Turkey, India, Burkina Faso and the United States offset increases in China, Brazil, Pakistan, and Australia.  World trade is increased 600,000 bales as higher imports by China, Turkey, and Pakistan more than offset declines in Vietnam and Bangladesh. Exports rose for Brazil, Benin, and India, but fell for Turkey and Burkina Faso. Lower 2017/18 India mill use is largely responsible for a 600,000-bale increase in world 2018/19 beginning stocks.  Projected 2018/19 consumption in India is reduced 500,000 bales since December, and is reduced 1 million bales for China.  Global use is reduced 2 million bales, with smaller declines in Vietnam, Turkey, and the United States.  World 2018/19 ending stocks are now 2.3 million bales above their previous estimate, with a 2.0-million-bale increase for China.",
    "May_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 112.9 million tons, down 3.1 million from 2015/16 mainly on lower soybean production.  Production forecasts are also lower for sunflowerseed, canola, and peanuts, but higher for cottonseed.  Soybean production is projected at 3,800 million bushels, down 129 million from the 2015 crop on lower harvested area and trend yields.  Supplies are projected at 4,230 million bushels, up 1.9 percent from 2015/16 with higher beginning stocks more than offsetting lower production.The U.S. soybean crush for 2016/17 is projected at 1,915 million bushels, up 35 million from 2015/16.  Domestic soybean meal disappearance is projected to increase with expected gains in U.S. meat production.  With limited gains for competing exporters, U.S. soybean meal exports are projected at 12.0 million short tons, up 0.5 million from 2015/16.  Soybean exports are forecast at 1,885 million bushels, up 145 million from the revised 2015/16 projection.  Sharply reduced stocks in South America this fall will limit competition during the first half of the marketing year.  In addition, limited soybean production gains are projected for the 2016/17 South American harvest in early 2017.  With forecasted global soybean import growth of 3.8 percent, the U.S. soybean export share is projected at 37 percent, up slightly from 2015/16 and near the 5-year average.  U.S. ending stocks for 2016/17 are forecast at 305 million bushels, down 95 million from the revised 2015/16 projection.  The 2016/17 U.S. season-average soybean price range is forecast at $8.35 to $9.85 per bushel compared with $8.85 per bushel in 2015/16.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $300 to $340 per short ton, compared with $310 per ton for 2015/16.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 30.5 to 33.5 cents per pound compared with 30.0 cents for 2015/16. Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 533.8 million tons, up 2.1 percent from 2015/16.  Global soybean production is projected at 324.2 million tons, up 8.3 million with gains for India, Brazil, Ukraine, and Argentina, partly offset by lower U.S. production.  The Brazil soybean crop is projected at 103.0 million tons, up 4.0 million on higher area and yields.  China soybean production is projected higher on increased harvested area as policy changes reduce incentives to plant corn.  The Argentina soybean crop is projected at 57.0 million tons, up 0.5 million from the revised 2015/16 crop.  The 2015/16 crop is projected at 56.5 million tons, down 2.5 million mainly on lower area resulting from flooding in April.  Total global oilseed supplies are up less than 1 percent from 2015/16.  With crush projected to increase 2.3 percent, global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 76.9 million tons, down 9.5 percent from 2015/16.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.2 percent in 2016/17.  Protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.7 percent in China which accounts for 32 percent of global protein consumption gains.  Global soybean exports are projected at 138.3 million tons, up 4.3 percent from 2015/16.  China soybean imports are projected at 87.0 million tons, up 4.0 million from 2015/16.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected at 183.8 million tons, up 3.0 percent in 2016/17 led by increases for India, China, and Indonesia.  Global vegetable oil ending stocks are projected at 16.9 million tons, down 7.9 percent from 2015/16.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for the 2016/17 October-September fiscal year is projected at 5.090 million short tons, raw value (STRV).  Early planting of the 2016/17 sugarbeet crop implies above-average yields and a larger proportion of the crop harvested in August and September prior to the start of the coming fiscal year.  The estimate for 2015/16 beet sugar production is raised to 5.064 million STRV.  Cane sugar production for 2016/17 is projected at 3.620 million STRV.  Projections for Florida and Louisiana assume trend yields and the same area harvested as the previous year.  Production in Texas is projected the same as 2015/16, and Hawaii is projected at 40,000 STRV for the 3 months of processing before the mill closure at the end of the calendar year.Sugar imports for 2016/17 are projected at 3.479 million STRV.  Total TRQ imports are projected at 1.531 million STRV, the sum of the WTO TRQs less a shortfall projected at 99,208, as well as imports under several Free Trade Agreements with sugar import provisions.  Re-export imports are projected at 175,000 STRV, imports from Mexico at 1.758 million, and high-tier tariff imports at 15,000.Deliveries for human consumption for 2016/17 are projected at 12.080 million STRV, an increase of 0.7 percent relative to 2015/16. The estimate of 2015/16 deliveries is increased by 45,000 STRV to 12.0 million based on share-to-date analysis of deliveries of sugar processed in the United States and expected direct consumption imports. Mexico sugar production for 2016/17 is projected at 6.1 million metric tons (MT), slightly below the estimate of 6.184 million for 2015/16. Sugar deliveries for human consumption are projected at 4.398 million MT, slightly above 2015/16. Sugar deliveries for Mexico\u2019s sugar-containing products export program (IMMEX) are projected at 254,717 MT, the same level now projected for 2015/16 after Mexico cut off duty-free imports from the United States that benefitted from the U.S. re-export import program. Exports to the United States are projected at 1.505 million MT, as per the limit set in the December 2014 Countervailing Duty Suspension Agreement.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production in 2017 is projected to be above 2016.  Beef production is forecast higher as larger 2015 and 2016 calf crops are expected to support year-over-year increases in cattle placements in late 2016 and early 2017.  Marketings of fed cattle are forecast higher during 2017 while carcass weights are expected to increase with good forage conditions and lower feed costs.  Pork production is expected to increase with larger hog supplies and heavier carcass weights.  A modest expansion of farrowings is expected during the latter part of 2016 and early 2017, and continued growth in pigs per litter will support larger pig crops.  Broiler production is forecast higher as the industry continues its current expansion path.  Turkey production will continue to increase during 2017, but not at the rate of growth expected for 2016 when the sector is rebuilding following the outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in 2015.  Egg production for 2017 is forecast to expand as the egg sector continues to recover from the effects of HPAI. The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2016 is lowered from last month as production forecasts for beef, and poultry are reduced.  Pork is raised on the pace of slaughter, but beef production is reduced on lowered first-half carcass weights.  Broiler production is adjusted to reflect first quarter data.  Turkey production is reduced on a slower expected pace of recovery from HPAI.  Egg production for 2016 is raised on higher expected first-half production.  Red meat and poultry exports are expected to increase in 2017 with expanding production and moderating prices; conversely, imports of beef are expected to decline.  For 2016, the beef trade forecast is adjusted to reflect March trade data; no change is made to the forecast.  The pork export forecast is adjusted to reflect March data; imports are reduced on the slow pace of trade to date.  Broiler exports are forecast weaker on a slower expected pace of recovery in the first half of the year.  Turkey exports are adjusted for March data.  For 2017, prices of fed cattle, hogs, broilers, and turkeys are all forecast below 2016 as supplies of meat are forecast higher.  Egg prices are forecast higher on firm demand.  As for 2016, the fed cattle price forecast is lowered from last month as prices have weakened and cattle supplies remain relatively large.  The annual average hog price is unchanged from last month.  Broiler and turkey prices are forecast higher as prices remain strong with slower expected growth in production.  Egg prices are lowered.  Milk production for 2017 is forecast higher as improved forage availability and continued favorable feed costs are expected to support gains in milk per cow.  Cow numbers are expected to remain near 2016 levels.  Commercial exports on both a fat and skim-solids basis are forecast higher as expected tighter world supplies and increasing demand lead to expanded export opportunities.  Imports are forecast lower as domestic production increases.  With stronger domestic and export demand, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey prices are forecast higher but butter prices are forecast lower.  The Class III price is forecast higher on stronger cheese and whey prices, and the Class IV price is forecast higher as a weaker butter price is more than offset by the higher NDM price.  The all milk price is forecast higher than 2016 at $15.25 to $16.25 per cwt.Milk production in 2016 is forecast higher than last month, as the cow inventory is expected to expand slightly and growth in milk per cow during the first half of the year is forecast higher.  Imports are raised on both a fat and skim-solids basis; exports on a fat basis are raised but are unchanged on a skim-solids basis.  Cheese, butter, and NDM prices are forecast lower on weaker demand and larger supplies, but whey prices are raised.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are reduced.  The milk price is forecast lower at $14.60 to $15.10 per cwt.COTTON:  A projected 2016/17 U.S. cotton crop of 14.8 million bales is expected to boost next season\u2019s ending stocks well above the beginning level.  Production is anticipated to rise 15 percent from 2015/16, based on 9.6 million planted acres as indicated in Prospective Plantings, combined with below-average abandonment, due to relatively favorable moisture, and average yields.  Domestic mill use is projected stable at 3.6 million bales, while exports are expected to rise to 10.5 million, on higher available supplies and more marketable qualities.  Ending stocks are projected at 4.7 million bales, or one-third of total use.  The preliminary range for the marketing year average price received by producers is 47.0 to 67.0 cents per pound.For 2015/16, U.S. cotton production is increased marginally.  The export forecast is reduced to 9.0 million bales, reflecting lower-than-anticipated export sales to date, with ending stocks raised accordingly. The world 2016/17 cotton projections show a decline in stocks of more than 6.0 million bales, as consumption exceeds production for the second consecutive season.  Global production is expected to rise nearly 5 percent, despite marginally lower area, as yields recover from weather and pest pressures that affected crops in 2015/16.  Production is forecast to rise mainly in Pakistan, the United States, India, and Turkey, partially offset by a 1.3-million-bale reduction for China.  Global consumption is projected to rise 1.6 percent, as prices overall remain low and mills in China gain access to domestic cotton at more competitive prices.  Projected world trade is lowered slightly from 2015/16 as increased production, especially in Pakistan, reduces reliance on imports.  Ending stocks are projected at 96.5 million bales, 87 percent of world consumption.  Falling China stocks exceed the projected global decline while stocks outside of China show a slight increase.  Despite the projected decrease, China stocks are equivalent to nearly 170 percent of China\u2019s total disappearance.",
    "August_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 115.4 million tons, up 0.4 million from last month as a higher soybean production forecast offsets lower cottonseed and peanut crops.  Soybean production for 2015/16 is projected at 3.916 billion bushels, up 31 million as a higher yield offsets a lower harvested area.  Harvested area is revised down 0.9 million acres from the July estimate to 83.5 million mainly on lower acreage in Missouri.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 46.9 bushels per acre is 0.9 bushels above last month\u2019s projected trend and 0.9 bushels below last year\u2019s record yield.  Soybean supplies for 2015/16 are projected 16 million bushels above last month based on the higher production forecast.  Forecast U.S. soybean exports are lowered by 50 million bushels to 1.725 billion, as a result of slow export sales commitments.  Soybean crush is raised 20 million bushels based on expected higher domestic use of soybean meal and soybean oil.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 470 million bushels, up 45 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2015/16 is forecast at $8.40 to $9.90 per bushel, down 10 cents at the midpoint from last month.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $310 to $350, down 5 dollars at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.5 to 32.5 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.U.S. changes for 2014/15 include increased soybean crush, which is raised 15 million bushels to 1.845 billion reflecting higher domestic use and exports of soybean meal.  With higher expected domestic use, the forecast of season-ending soybean stocks are reduced to 240 million bushels.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 529.1 million tons, down 2.7 million tons from last month.  Reductions for rapeseed, sunflowerseed, cottonseed, and peanuts more than offset an increase in soybean production.  Soybean production is projected up 1.1 million tons with higher crops for the United States and Ukraine.  Rapeseed production is reduced 2.6 million tons as hot and dry weather curtailed yields in Canada and the EU, while harvested area is lowered for Ukraine, Belarus, and Australia.  Other changes include lower EU sunflowerseed production, and reduced cottonseed production for India and China.Projected 2015/16 global soybean ending stocks are lowered 4.9 million tons to 86.9 million with a higher crush for China, the EU, and the United States.  Despite this month\u2019s reduction, global soybean stocks remain record high.  Projected soybean imports for China in 2015/16 are increased 1.5 million tons to 79 million and up from a revised 2014/15 forecast of 77 million.  Soybean exports for Brazil and Argentina are projected higher due to growth in global trade.SUGAR:  Beginning stocks for 2015/16 are increased 91,482 short tons, raw value (STRV) due to increases in 2014/15 production (53,500) and imports (37,982) with no change in 2014/15 total use. Total 2015/16 sugar production is projected at 8.800 million STRV, an increase of 35,000 over last month.  The entire increase is attributable to increased cane sugar production in Florida based on the crop forecast made in the National Agricultural Statistics Service\u2019s (NASS\u2019s) August 2015 Crop Production.  Beet sugar for the 2015/16 August-July crop year is forecast at 5.163 million STRV, an increase of 45,000 based on NASS\u2019s sugarbeet crop forecast and an upward revision to projected sucrose content to 17.5 percent based on processors\u2019 reports.  National yield is forecast at a record 29.9 tons/acre, the same as projected last month.  Area harvested is up 4,000 acres from a previous forecast to 1.144 million acres.  Due to the early start to the harvest, the entire increase in sugar is expected in August and September adding a net 45,000 STRV to 2014/15 production, now estimated at 4.825 million.  Imports for 2015/16 are projected at 3.369 million STRV based on an upward projection of high-tier tariff  imports to 15,000 and a very small revision to imports from Mexico resulting from a difference in rounding made by the Commerce Department in estimating the Target Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs as defined in the CVD Suspension Agreement.  With no change in total use, ending stocks are projected at 1.780 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.6 percent.Mexico beginning stocks for 2015/16 are estimated at 836,774 metric tons (MT), down 190,616 from last month because of an upward estimate of 2014/15 deliveries for consumption to 4.441million MT. Production for 2015/16 is unchanged at 6.0 million.  Deliveries for 2015/16 are increased by 192,477 MT to 4.501 million MT.  It is assumed that per capita sweetener consumption is unchanged from 2014/15 at 49.4 kilograms and that consumption of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the same as that estimated for 2014/15; i.e., 1.420 million MT, dry weight.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are forecast residually at 832,564 MT, down 31.5 percent from last month.  The implied stocks-to-consumption ratio is 18.5 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production in 2015 and 2016 are lowered from last month.  Beef production for 2015 and 2016 is lowered due to a combination of slower marketings of fed cattle and reduced cow slaughter.  Pork production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged.  Broiler production for 2015 is lowered from last month as growth in the number of eggs set and chicks placed has slowed.  Weaker forecast broiler prices are expected to limit production growth as well.  No change is made to 2016 production.  Turkey production is raised for 2015 based on hatchery data.  Egg production for 2015 is lowered based on second quarter production but no change is made to the forecasts for the remainder of 2015 and 2016.The beef export forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are lowered from last month on the relative strength of the dollar and expectations of weak demand.  Beef imports are raised on strength in demand for processing-grade beef.  Pork and broiler imports and exports are adjusted to reflect June trade data.  The turkey export forecast is reduced for 2015 and 2016 as supplies remain tight.     Cattle prices for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month on weaker demand.  Hog prices are reduced for 2015 as supplies are large.  Broiler prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016 on competition from relatively lower red meat prices.  Turkey prices for 2015 are raised from last month on tighter supplies.  Egg prices for both 2015 and 2016 are raised from last month on tight supplies and prices to date.The milk production forecast for 2015 is unchanged from last month, but weaker milk prices in late 2015 and 2016 result in lower production for 2016 than forecast last month.  Exports are reduced as competition in world markets is expected to be robust in both 2015 and 2016 and relatively strong domestic demand will likely encourage increased imports.  Stocks at the end of 2015 are forecast higher than last month as a result of increased imports and reduced exports.  Skim stocks for the end of 2016 are also forecast higher than last month.Larger domestic supplies as a result of increased imports and weaker exports are expected to pressure product prices in 2015.  Forecast prices for butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey are lowered from last month.  Price forecasts for 2016 for cheese, whey, and NDM are reduced.  However, domestic demand strength and expectations that milk will flow away from butter and NDM production in 2016 support an increase in the butter price forecast.  NDM prices are expected to be pressured by continued competition in international markets.  Class III and Class IV prices are reduced from last month for both 2015 and 2016.  The all milk price is forecast at $16.75 to $16.95 per cwt for 2015 and $16.40 to $17.40 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2015/16 U.S. cotton estimates include sharply lower supplies, disappearance, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production for the 2015 crop is reduced 10 percent to 13.1 million bales, based on this season\u2019s first production field survey, which indicates lower planted area, higher abandonment, and a lower average yield compared to last month\u2019s expectations.  Beginning stocks are reduced 500,000 bales due to higher-than-expected 2014/15 exports; in addition, the 2014/15 ending stocks estimate includes a preliminary reduction based on reported stocks in public warehouses.  U.S. ending stocks for 2014/15 will be revised further as more data becomes available.  Domestic mill use for 2015/16 is reduced marginally, but exports are lowered 800,000 bales due to the lower production.  Ending stocks of 3.1 million bales would be 23 percent of total use.  The range for the marketing year average price is raised to 58 to 72 cents per pound, for a midpoint of 65 cents, which is up 3 cents from last month.Projected 2015/16 world cotton stocks are reduced nearly 3 million bales this month, due mainly to lower estimated production in the world\u2019s major cotton-producing countries.  In addition to the U.S. reduction, production is lowered 1.0 million bales in China based on lower reported area and extreme heat in Xinjiang, and 0.5 million bales in India based on lower-than-expected plantings to date.  Production is also reduced for Uzbekistan, but is raised for Brazil, Australia, and Pakistan.  World consumption and trade are raised, due to multiple, mostly offsetting, changes, the largest of which incorporates historical and current increases to imports and consumption for Bangladesh (see http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/cotton.pdf  for detailed explanations of revisions for Bangladesh and other countries).  World ending stocks are now projected at 105.2 million bales.  ",
    "December_2022": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2022/23 is forecast at 127.9 million tons, up slightly due to an increase for cottonseed.  Soybean supply and use projections for 2022/23 are unchanged from last month.  Based on a review of EPA's recent proposed rule for renewable fuel obligation targets, soybean oil used for biofuel for 2022/23 is reduced 200 million pounds to 11.6 billion.  Soybean oil exports are also reduced on historically low export sales through November.  With reduced use of soybean oil for biofuel and exports, food use and ending stocks are raised.  The U.S. season-average soybean price forecast is unchanged at $14.00 per bushel.  The soybean oil price is reduced 1 cent per pound to 68 cents.  The soybean meal price forecast is increased $10.00 to $410.00 per short ton.Global oilseed production for 2022/23 is projected at 644.4 million tons, down 1.2 million from last month.  Lower sunflower, rapeseed, palm kernel, and cottonseed production forecasts are partly offset by higher soybean output.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced for Russia and Ukraine based on harvest results.  Canola production for Canada is lowered 0.5 million tons to 19.0 million based on government reports.  Palm kernel and palm oil production is lowered for Indonesia for 2021/22, reflecting crop losses during periods of export restrictions and poor harvest weather.  Indonesian palm oil production for 2022/23 is also lowered 1.0 million tons to 45.5 million. The global soybean outlook includes higher production, exports, and ending stocks.  Production is raised on higher output for India and Ukraine.  Exports are raised slightly as higher shipments for Argentina are partly offset by lower exports for Canada and Paraguay.  With global crush relatively unchanged, ending stocks are raised 0.5 million tons to 102.7 million.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply in 2022/23 is virtually unchanged from last month as projected changes in production are counterbalanced by projected imports of sugar from Mexico in accordance with the terms of the CVD Suspension Agreements.  Beet sugar production is lowered 66,980 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.927 million.  Beet processors reduced their forecast of sugarbeets available for slicing by 252,846 tons in their December forecast published in Sweetener Market Data.  An increase in cane sugar production partially offsets the beet sugar decline.  Cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 18,460 STRV to 2.025 million.  Although NASS decreased its sugarcane yield to 32.2 tons/acre from 32.4, production is increased on more cane area for sugar instead of for seed and a 1.01 percent increase in recovery projected by processors.  Cane sugar in Texas is increased slightly on processor reporting.  Imports from Mexico are projected based on fulfilling U.S. Needs according to components from this December WASDE which will be used by the Department of Commerce in establishing the Export Limit as of January 1, 2023.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are residually projected at 1.707 million STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent, virtually unchanged from last month.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply in 2022/23 is virtually unchanged from last month as projected changes in production are counterbalanced by projected imports of sugar from Mexico in accordance with the terms of the CVD Suspension Agreements.

The WRO prohibits entry into the United States of raw sugar and sugar-based products produced by the company.  The USDA has determined that the DR sugar industry intends to re-configure distribution in the local sugar market and re-arrange the company level allotments of the TRQ with the local mills to meet its full 2022/23 raw sugar TRQ allocation. USDA projects Mexico sugar production for 2022/23 the same as last month at 5.900 million metric tons (MT).  CONADESUCA released its 2022/23 forecast of 6.026 million MT in November.  The USDA adopts CONADESUCA projected sugarcane yield of 64.06 MT/hectare and recovery of 11.30 percent, but projects area harvested only at 814,850 hectares, up about 15,000 hectares from last month but less than CONADESUCA\u2019s forecast of 832,245.  Exports are projected at 1.266 million MT and almost all (barring a small amount exported in October) is intended for the U.S. market under export license.  Ending stocks are projected at a level covering 2023/24 use for 2.5 months prior to next season\u2019s campaign.  Shipments to IMMEX are reduced by 38,886 MT to 494,114 to accommodate exports to the U.S. market.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher beef, broiler, and turkey forecasts for the fourth quarter are partly offset by lower pork.  Beef production is raised with higher expected cattle slaughter as well as heavier carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered on lighter carcass weights.  Broiler and turkey production are raised on current slaughter and hatchery data.  Egg production is raised slightly on revised third-quarter data.For 2023, the beef forecast is unchanged, with offsetting first and second quarter changes.  Broiler production is raised on more rapid expected growth in bird numbers later in the year.  Turkey production is lowered for the first half of the year on recent discoveries of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.  Egg production is reduced on a slower expected pace of recovery.Beef imports for 2022 are unchanged, but exports are raised on recent data.  Exports are raised for 2023 on expectations of continued momentum to East Asian markets.  Pork imports and exports for 2022 are both lowered on recent data.  Pork imports for 2023 are lowered slightly, while exports are unchanged.  The broiler export forecast for 2022 is raised on recent trade data, while 2023 exports are lowered.  Turkey exports are unchanged, but imports are raised for both years on current data and tightness in domestic supplies.  Price forecasts for cattle, hogs, and broilers are unchanged for 2022 and 2023.  The turkey price forecast for 2022 is lowered on current price data, but the forecast for 2023 is unchanged.  Egg price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are raised on recent prices and expectations of continued firm demand and tight supplies. The milk production forecast for 2022 is unchanged from last month.  The 2023 production forecast is raised slightly with both higher expected cow numbers and slightly more rapid growth in output per cow.Fat and skim-solids basis imports for 2022 are raised, driven by recent trade data and expectations of continued demand for imported cheese and butterfat products.  Forecasts for 2023 fat basis and skim-solids basis imports are raised on imports of butter and milk proteins, respectively.  Exports on a fat basis for 2022 and 2023 are raised on butter and casein.  Exports on a skim-solids basis are raised in 2022 as higher nonfat dry milk (NDM) more than offsets lower lactose.  The 2023 forecast is reduced on lower lactose shipments.For 2022, forecasts for butter and cheese are raised on recent prices and expectations of continued strength in demand, but whey and NDM prices are unchanged.  The Class III price is raised on the higher cheese price and the Class IV price is raised on the higher butter price.  For 2023, the price forecasts for cheese and butter are raised as demand strength carries into 2023, but prices for NDM and whey are lowered on pressure from international markets.  The higher cheese price more than offsets the lower whey price and the Class III price is raised while the Class IV price forecast is lowered, reflecting the lower NDM price.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is raised to $25.65 per cwt and the 2023 all milk price is raised to $22.70 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. cotton forecasts include higher production and ending stocks but lower mill use and exports.  Production is 211,000 bales higher\u2014at 14.2 million bales\u2014mainly due to higher yields in the Delta and Southeast.  Mill use is lowered 100,000 bales reflecting reduced spinning levels to date and weaker expectations for future demand.  A reduction in expected world demand and trade results in a 250,000-bale decrease for U.S. cotton exports, down to 12.25 million.  Ending stocks are now expected to be 500,000 bales higher than they were a month earlier, but the upland cotton season-average farm price is unchanged at 85 cents per pound.The global 2022/23 cotton forecasts include lower production, consumption, and trade, but higher ending stocks.  Production is down 700,000 bales from the previous month\u2019s forecast, led by an 800,000-bale decline in Pakistan\u2019s flood-damaged crop.  Australian production is estimated 500,000 bales lower, and Mali\u2019s crop is reduced 120,000 bales.  Higher than expected yields in Turkey resulted in a 500,000-bale upward revision.  Global consumption is down 3.3 million bales from the previous month, and on a year-to-year basis world cotton use is now projected to decline 4.9 percent, similar to the decline experienced in 2021/22.  This month\u2019s changes to 2022/23 consumption include 1.0-million-bale reductions for China and India, and smaller reductions for Pakistan, Turkey, and Vietnam.  Projected world trade is cut 950,000 bales this month, with imports reduced for China, Turkey, and Vietnam.  Exports are reduced for Australia, Mali, Malaysia, India, and Brazil.  World ending stocks are projected 2.3 million bales higher this month, and at 89.6 million bales are 4.1 million higher than in 2021/22.",
    "March_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2012/13 are unchanged this month, leaving ending stocks at 125 million bushels.  Although soybean export commitments through February exceeded last year\u2019s pace, U.S. exports are expected to decline in the months ahead as increased competition from a record South American soybean crop limits additional U.S. sales during the second half of the marketing year.  Soybean crush is also ahead of last year\u2019s pace, but is projected to slow in the second half of the marketing year on declining soybean meal exports as competition from South America, especially Argentina, increases with the new-crop harvest.The projected season-average price range for soybeans is narrowed 25 cents on both ends of the range to $13.80 to $14.80 per bushel.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 48.5 to 51.5 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $425 to $445 per short ton, down 10 dollars at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2012/13 is projected at 466.8 million tons, down slightly from last month as reduced soybean and sunflowerseed production is mostly offset by increased rapeseed and cottonseed production.  Foreign production, projected at 374.1 million tons, accounts for all of the change.  Argentina soybean production is projected at 51.5 million tons, down 1.5 million.  Despite widespread rains in recent weeks, the extended dry period during planting and early crop development limited plantings and reduced yield prospects.  China rapeseed production is projected at 13.5 million tons, up 0.9 million based on increased area and yield indicated in recently released official government statistics.  Other changes include higher rapeseed production for Australia and India, reduced sunflowerseed production for Argentina, and increased palm oil production for Malaysia.  Cottonseed production is increased for China and reduced for Pakistan and Brazil.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2012/13 is increased 91,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, as higher sugar imports from Mexico more than offset lower production and tariff rate quota (TRQ) imports.  Reduced Florida cane sugar production reflects processors\u2019 estimates while lower TRQ imports reflect increased shortfall.  Higher imports from Mexico result from increased production which is based on higher-than-expected sugarcane yields to date.  Sugar use is unchanged for the United States and ending stocks are increased for both the United States and Mexico. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2013 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher beef, broiler, and turkey production is expected to more than offset lower forecast pork production.  Beef production is raised from last month largely due to heavier expected carcass weights.  Steer and heifer slaughter is reduced for the first quarter, but cow slaughter is raised.  Pork production is reduced based on lower slaughter in the first quarter.  The broiler production forecast is raised as producers are expected to respond to stronger forecast first-half broiler prices and lower projected second-half feed meal prices.  Turkey production is forecast higher on heavier bird weights and slightly higher slaughter.  Egg production is raised based on hatchery data.  Poultry and egg production for 2012 is adjusted to reflect revisions in production data.The beef export and import forecasts for 2013 are lowered based on slower-than-expected shipments in January.  Pork exports are lowered from last month as export demand has softened.  The broiler export forecast is unchanged from last month.  Changes in estimates for 2012 trade reflect December data.Cattle prices for 2013 are lowered from last month, reflecting slightly weaker demand for fed cattle into the second quarter of the year.  Hog and broiler price forecasts are unchanged from last month.  Forecast broiler prices are raised in the first half on strong demand, but are reduced in the second half on production increases.  Turkey prices are lowered on greater production.  Egg price forecasts are unchanged.The milk production forecast for 2013 is raised from last month largely due to a slower pace of herd reduction and higher first-quarter milk per cow.  The 2013 fat-basis export forecast is raised largely on stronger shipments of butter.  Skim-solid exports are raised based on greater nonfat dry milk (NDM).  Imports are unchanged on both a fat and skim-solidsbasis.  Changes in 2012 estimates of supply and use reflect revised annual data.Prices for cheese and whey are lowered based on expectations of increased production and moderate demand.  The forecast butter price is unchanged from last month and the range is tightened.  The forecast price of NDM is raised as stronger export demand is expected to support prices.  The Class III price forecast is reduced from last month, reflecting weaker cheese and whey prices while Class IV is increased due to higher NDM prices.  The all milk price for 2013 is raised to $19.00-$19.60 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2012/13 U.S. cotton estimates include larger exports and lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  Exports are raised 250,000 bales based on strong sales and shipments in recent weeks.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 4.2 million bales, equal to 26 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the average price received by producers of 70 to 73 cents per pound is raised 1 cent on the lower end.This month\u2019s 2012/13 world cotton estimates show higher production, consumption, and trade, with ending stocks reduced marginally.  World production is raised about 900,000 bales from last month, including a 1.0-million-bale increase in the China crop, based on recent statistical reports for the eastern provinces and on classification data for Xinjiang.  Production also is raised for Uzbekistan, Mexico, and Turkmenistan, but is reduced for Pakistan and Brazil.  Consumption is raised for China, India, and Bangladesh.  World trade is raised 1.5 million bales, due mainly to higher imports by China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.  Exports are raised for India, the United States, Australia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, but are lowered for Pakistan.  Global ending stocks are now forecast at 81.7 million bales.  ",
    "August_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 113.7 million tons, up 0.6 million from last month mainly due to a higher soybean production forecast.  Soybean production for 2014/15 is forecast at 3,816 million bushels, up 16 million due to a higher yield.  Harvested area is forecast at 84.1 million acres, unchanged from July.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast is a record 45.4 bushels per acre, 0.2 bushels above last month and 2.1 bushels above last year.  Soybean supplies for 2014/15 are projected slightly above last month based on the higher production forecast.  With minimal supply gains, soybean exports and crush are unchanged, leaving ending stocks projected at 430 million bushels.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2014/15 is forecast at $9.35 to $11.35 per bushel, down 15 cents on both ends.  Soybean meal and oil prices are forecast at $340 to $380, down 10 dollars at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 35 to 39 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.U.S. soybean balance sheet changes for 2013/14 include reduced imports and increased exports.  Imports are lowered 5 million bushels to 80 million based in part on revised import data for September \u2013 December 2013 from the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Exports are raised 20 million bushels to 1,640 million reflecting both revised export data for September through December 2013 from the Department of Commerce and inspections data for July 2014.  These changes are offset with lower residual use, leaving ending stocks unchanged at 140 million bushels.  With these changes, the 2013/14 soybean stocks-to-use ratio is projected at 4.2 percent, which if realized would be the lowest in more than 40 years.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 521.8 million tons, slightly below last month.  Gains for rapeseed and cottonseed are more than offset by reductions for soybeans, sunflowerseed, and peanuts.  Higher soybean production for the United States is offset by a reduction for India where the delayed monsoon results in lower planted area.  Rapeseed production is raised for China, EU, and Ukraine.  These gains are partly offset by a smaller crop projected for Canada with lower area resulting from flooding in parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Other changes include lower sunflowerseed production for Russia, reduced peanut production for China, and increased cottonseed production for India.SUGAR:  The Mexico 2013/14 estimate for sugar production is reduced by 5,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.020 million, based on end-of-harvest reporting from Mexican authorities.  The 2013/14 estimate of exports is increased by 50,000 MT based on pace-to-date of exports to the United States.  Deliveries for consumption are reduced by 106,000 MT, based on a slowdown in the pace through June.  With 2014/15 beginning stocks 51,000 MT higher than last month, imports in 2014/15 are reduced by that same amount to meet consumption needs until the full start of the 2014/15 harvest in mid-December.  There are no changes to 2014/15 production, deliveries, total exports, or ending stocks.  Exports to the United States are reduced by 575,000 MT based on signed contracts confirmed by the USDA committing Mexico to ship to non-U.S. destinations in that amount in 2014/15.The U.S. 2013/14 cane sugar production is lowered by 25,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on a slow harvest pace in Hawaii.  Tariff-rate quota (TRQ) shortfall for 2013/14 is increased by 87,547 STRV and 2013/14 imports from Mexico are increased by 58,423 for a net import reduction of 29,000.  For 2014/15, beginning stocks are reduced 54,000 STRV, cane sugar production is increased by 116,000 based on processors\u2019 reporting, and imports from Mexico are reduced by 672,000 to 1.205 million.  With no other changes, ending stocks are projected at 837,000 STRV.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2014 is raised from last month.  Production is raised for beef, pork, and broilers as lower feed prices encourage producers to raise animals to heavier weights.  Turkey production is reduced slightly based on June production data.  Egg production is reduced based on lower expected hatching egg production.  For 2015, lower feed costs are expected to lead to higher cattle, hog, and broiler weights, but in the case of beef, reduced feedlot numbers are expected to lead to lower slaughter, more than offsetting any gains from carcass weights.  Broiler producers are also expected to increase bird numbers more rapidly than previously forecast during 2015 as returns are expected to be more favorable.  Egg production forecasts are unchanged. Forecasts for 2014 and 2015 beef imports are raised as demand for processing grade beef remains strong.  Exports for 2014 and 2015 are raised as demand in a number of countries remains strong, despite high beef prices.  Pork imports for 2014 and 2015 are raised slightly.  Despite the closure of Russia to U.S. exports into 2015, pork export forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised as demand in other major markets is expected to grow.  Broiler exports are reduced for 2014 and 2015 as Russia\u2019s import ban will affect sales.  Turkey export forecasts are raised for 2014, but are unchanged for 2015.   Cattle price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised from last month on the strength of demand and continued tight supplies of fed cattle.  The annual price forecast for hogs is unchanged for 2014, but is lowered for 2015 from last month on slightly weaker expected demand.  The annual broiler price forecast for 2014 is lowered, but the price for 2015 is unchanged.  The turkey price forecast for 2014 is raised based on July price data.  The egg price forecasts for both 2014 and 2015 are raised as demand remains strong.  The milk production forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised slightly as lower feed costs are expected to support higher output per cow.  Fat basis export forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are lowered as Russia\u2019s ban on imports from a number of dairy exporting countries will likely increase competition in export markets.  Fat basis imports are raised as supplies in competing exporters are expected to be large.  The skim-solids export forecast is raised slightly for 2014, but is reduced in 2015 as competition increases.  Skim-solids imports are unchanged from last month. Butter prices and whey price forecasts are raised for 2014 with strength in butter prices expected to carry into 2015.  Cheese prices and nonfat dry milk prices are forecast higher in 2014, but their price forecasts for 2015 are unchanged from last month.  Class III and Class IV prices for 2014 are raised on stronger component product prices and the Class III price forecast for 2015 is raised reflecting strength in whey prices.  The all milk price is raised to $23.55 to $23.75 per cwt for 2014, but remains unchanged at $19.75 to $20.75 per cwt for 2015.COTTON:  The U.S. 2014/15 cotton forecasts include higher production, exports, and ending stocks compared with last month.  Beginning stocks are reduced 100,000 bales due to preliminary stocks indications for July 31, 2014.  Production is raised 6 percent to 17.5 million bales in the first survey-based estimate of U.S. crop production, mainly on lower expected abandonment.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are raised 500,000 bales to 10.7 million on stronger foreign import demand and the larger available supply.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 5.6 million bales, 39 percent of total use, the largest stocks-to-use ratio since 2007/08.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average price received by producers of 58-72 cents per pound is lowered on both ends, with the midpoint now forecast at 65 cents.Revisions to the 2014/15 world cotton supply and demand balance sheet result in marginally lower global ending stocks compared with last month\u2019s forecast.  Beginning stocks are reduced 600,000 bales due to adjustments in 2013/14 for several countries.  For 2014/15, production is raised for the United States, India, and Mexico, but lowered for Brazil and Australia.  World consumption is raised about 1 percent from last month to 112.6 million bales, the highest level since 2010/11, as falling prices are anticipated to boost cotton\u2019s share of textile fiber use.  Ending stocks are now projected at 105.1 million bales, with stocks outside of China expected to grow by about 4 million bales from 2013/14.    ",
    "May_2017": "OILSEEDS:  The 2017/18 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and ending stocks.  The soybean crop is projected at 4,255 million bushels, down 52 million from last year\u2019s record crop with a forecast lower trend yield more than offsetting higher harvested area.  With sharply higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 4,715 million bushels, up 4 percent from 2016/17.  The U.S. soybean crush for 2017/18 is projected at 1,950 million bushels, up 25 million from the revised 2016/17 forecast.  Domestic soybean meal disappearance is forecast to increase with expected gains in U.S. meat production.  U.S. soybean meal exports are forecast at 12.4 million short tons, leaving the U.S share of global trade slightly lower than in 2016/17.  With increased supplies and lower projected prices, U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2,150 million bushels, up 100 million from the revised 2016/17 projection.  Despite sharply higher beginning stocks in South America this fall, a smaller projected harvest in early 2018 leaves 2017/18 total supplies almost unchanged from 2016/17, limiting projected gains for South American soybean exports.  With forecast global soybean import growth of 5 percent, the U.S. soybean export share is projected at 39 percent, up slightly from 2016/17 and near the 5-year average.  U.S. ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 480 million bushels, up 45 million from the revised 2016/17 forecast.  The 2017/18 U.S. season-average soybean price range is forecast at $8.30 to $10.30 per bushel compared with $9.55 per bushel in 2016/17.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $295 to $335 per short ton, compared with $320 per ton for 2016/17.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 30.0 to 34.0 cents per pound compared with 31.75 cents for 2016/17.The 2017/18 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, crush, and exports compared to last year.  Global oilseed production is projected at 572.1 million tons, up 6.0 million from 2016/17.  Growth in rapeseed, cottonseed, peanut, sunflowerseed, copra, and palm kernel is partly offset by lower soybean production.  Soybean production is projected down 3.4 million tons to 344.7 million mainly on declines from last year\u2019s records for the United States, Brazil, and Paraguay as yields return to trend levels.  Conversely, soybean production is forecast up for Canada, China, Bolivia, and Ukraine.  Rapeseed production is projected to increase 6 percent to 72.8 million with increases for Canada, the EU, Ukraine, and India.Global oilseed crush is forecast to increase 17 million tons to 486.0 million in 2017/18 driven by higher demand for protein meals and oils.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to expand 4 percent in 2017/18.  China\u2019s soybean meal equivalent consumption is expected to grow at 5 percent, similar to last year but below the prior 5-year average.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected at 189.0 million tons, up 5.4 million led by increases for India and China.  Soy oil production gains are expected for China and palm oil production gains for Indonesia and Malaysia.  Global soybean exports are projected at 149.6 million tons, up 5.0 million from 2016/17.  Imports are expected to grow for China, Egypt, Vietnam, and the EU.  Lower global production has led to a 1.3-million-ton decrease in soybean stocks, particularly in Brazil and Argentina where stocks are expected to decline by 2.6 million tons combined.  Partially offsetting are higher stocks in the United States and Canada.SUGAR:  U.S. fiscal year 2016/17 beet sugar production is decreased 64,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) based on lower expected sucrose recovery.  Cane sugar production in Texas is reduced by 2,795 STRV based on final processor reporting.  TRQ imports entering under Free Trade Agreements are increased by 2,555 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are increased by 100,000 STRV based on pace to date.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are estimated at 1.477 million STRV.Sugar production for 2017/18 is projected at 8.700 million STRV, the sum of beet sugar production of 4.950 million and cane sugar production of 3.750 million.  Imports for 2017/18 are projected at 3.858 million STRV and are comprised of TRQ imports of 1.373 million; re-export imports of 175,000; imports from Mexico of 2.301 million; and high-tier tariff imports of 10,000.  Projected 2017/18 TRQ imports of specialty sugar include only the WTO minimum quantity because any additional quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture.  Exports for 2017/18 are projected at 25,000 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are expected to increase 1.0 percent year-over-year to 12.322 million STRV.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected residually at 1.534 million, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.3 percent.  For 2016/17, Mexico sugar exports to non-U.S. destinations are reduced by 58,919 metric tons (MT) to 110,000 based on pace to date.  Product re-export deliveries under the IMMEX program are increased 60,000 MT to 390,000 to match the total now estimated by Mexico authorities for 2015/16.  Ending stocks are estimated residually at 1.342 million MT, an increase of 48,919 over last month.  For 2017/18, Mexico sugar production is projected at 6.225 million MT based on a sugarcane crop of 55.000 million and a recovery of about 11.3 percent.  Combined per capita consumption of sugar and HFCS for 2017/18 is projected the same as for 2016/17.  With flat HFCS consumption, sugar deliveries for human consumption for 2017/18 are projected at 4.528 million.  Exports to the United States are based on U.S. Needs as defined in the Suspension Agreements but, assuming additionally, that U.S. specialty sugar imports will be set at the same level as initially established for 2016/17.  LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total red meat and poultry production for 2018 is projected higher than 2017 on increased livestock and poultry production.  Cattle placements during second half 2017 and early 2018 are forecast higher; these cattle will be slaughtered during 2018, supporting higher beef production.  Carcass weights are expected to be higher.  Pork production is forecast higher on expected increased farrowings and continued gains in sow productivity.  Higher broiler and egg production reflects expanded production in response to moderate feed prices and relatively strong 2017 prices.  Turkey production is forecast higher as demand strengthens. Total red meat and poultry production for 2017 is reduced from the previous month on lower beef, pork and broiler production.  Beef and pork production is reduced on lighter expected cattle and hog carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered on lower forecast second-quarter production.  Turkey production is raised on higher first-quarter slaughter data.  The 2017 egg production forecast is reduced on lower first-quarter table egg production and lower expected hatching production for the remainder of the year.For 2018, larger beef supplies and lower prices are expected to support stronger U.S. beef exports.  Beef imports are forecast higher as supplies of domestic processing-grade beef remain relatively tight and supplies of beef increase in key exporting countries.  Pork exports are forecast to increase as expanding supplies and competitive prices support demand for U.S. pork.  U.S. pork imports are forecast to decline as domestic supplies are expected to pressure prices.  Broiler and turkey exports are forecast higher on expected continued gains in foreign demand. The 2017 beef and pork export forecasts are raised as demand is expected to remain strong.  The beef import forecast is raised on recent trade data for the first quarter, but pork imports are reduced.  Changes to the 2017 poultry and egg trade forecast reflect first-quarter trade data.  Cattle and hog prices for 2018 are forecast to decline relative to 2017 as both cattle and hog supplies are expected to increase.  Turkey and egg prices are forecast to increase in 2018 on increased demand.  The 2018 broiler price is forecast lower, as production increases and supplies of competing meats are higher.The 2017 cattle and hog price forecasts are raised on recent price strength and expectations that demand will remain relatively firm through the year.  The broiler price forecast is increased as second quarter prices are raised due to recent price strength.  Turkey and egg prices are forecast lower for the remainder of the year as relatively large supplies pressure prices.   Milk production for 2018 is forecast higher on stronger milk prices and moderate feed prices.  Commercial exports on fat and skim-solids bases are forecast higher on stronger global demand.  Fat basis imports are forecast modestly higher in 2018 while skim-solids basis imports are forecast lower relative to 2017.  Cheese and non-fat dry milk prices are forecast higher than 2017, but butter and whey prices are forecast lower.  The increase in the Class III price reflects higher forecast cheese prices which more than offset lower whey prices.  The Class IV price is higher as the higher non-fat dry milk price more than offset lower butter prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.55 to $18.55 per cwt for 2018.   Forecast milk production in 2017 is lowered from the previous month on slower growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis imports are lowered from the previous month while skim-solids basis imports are increased.  Commercial exports are forecast higher for both fat and skim-solids bases.  Non-fat dry milk price forecasts are raised from last month while butter is lower.  Cheese and whey prices are unchanged.  The Class III price is unchanged while the Class IV is higher than the previous month.  The milk price is forecast at $17.35 to $17.85 per cwt.NOTE:  U.S. dairy import, export, and stock estimates are adjusted to reflect changes in fat basis and skim-solids basis conversions and changes in the products used for the aggregate stocks estimates.  Historical revisions will be available after 1:00pm EDT at https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/historical.htm.  Documentation of the changes is available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/documentation/COTTON:  A projected 2017/18 U.S. cotton crop of 19.2 million bales is expected to sharply increase next season\u2019s ending stocks.  Production is anticipated to rise 12 percent from 2016/17, based on 12.2 million planted acres as indicated in Prospective Plantings, combined with below-average abandonment ( due to relatively favorable moisture ( and average yields. Domestic mill use is projected higher at 3.4 million bales, while exports are expected to fall to 14.0 million, as competitors\u2019 supplies grow. Ending stocks are projected at 5.0 million bales, or 29 percent of total use. The preliminary range for the marketing year average price received by producers is 54.0 to 74.0 cents per pound. For 2016/17, U.S. cotton production is reduced marginally from last month.  The export forecast is increased to 14.5 million bales, reflecting higher-than-anticipated export sales to date, with ending stocks lowered accordingly.The world 2017/18 cotton projections show a decline in stocks of 2.4 million bales, as consumption exceeds production for the third consecutive season. Global production is expected to rise nearly 7 percent, despite marginally lower average yields, as area rebounds to its highest level in 3 years. Production is forecast to rise in all major producing countries, led by the United States (2.0 million bales higher) and India (1.5 million bales higher). Global consumption is projected to rise 2.3 percent, as a growing world economy drives mill use higher around the world. Projected world trade is raised slightly from 2016/17, as import-oriented consumers such as Vietnam and Bangladesh are accounting for a larger share of world consumption. Ending stocks are projected at 87.1 million bales, 75 percent of world consumption. Falling China stocks exceed the projected global decline while stocks outside of China rise for the second consecutive year. Despite the projected decrease, China stocks are still equivalent to more than 100 percent of China\u2019s total disappearance.For 2016/17, world production is reduced marginally from last month, while consumption is raised slightly. Ending stocks lowered 1.4 million bales.  Consumption and imports are slightly higher in China, and ending stocks are lower in India, the United States, and China.",
    "February_2018": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. soybean outlook is for reduced exports and increased ending stocks.  Soybean exports for 2017/18 are projected at 2,100 million bushels, down 60 million from last month, reflecting shipments and sales through January and increased export competition on larger supplies in Brazil.  With soybean crush unchanged, soybean ending stocks are raised 60 million bushels to 530 million.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2017/18 is projected at $8.90 to $9.70 per bushel, unchanged at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 31 to 34 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $305 to $335 per short ton, up $5 at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 578.6 million tons, down 1.5 million with lower soybean production partly offset by higher cottonseed.  Soybean production is reduced 1.7 million tons to 346.9 million.  Soybean production for Brazil is projected at 112.0 million tons, up 2.0 million, as favorable weather throughout the growing season has raised yield prospects.  Argentina production is reduced 2.0 million tons to 54.0 million on lower harvested area and reduced yields resulting from periods of unseasonable warmth and dryness.  Soybean production is also reduced for several other countries including Paraguay, Bolivia, India, Ukraine, and South Africa.  Other changes include reduced sunflowerseed production for South Africa, increased cottonseed production for China, and lower cottonseed production for India.Global oilseed crush for 2017/18 is projected at 487.5 million tons, down 1.0 million.  Reduced soybean crush for Argentina and India accounts for most of the change.  Global oilseed stocks are projected lower with reduced soybean stocks for Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and India more than offsetting an increase for the United States.SUGAR:  Total sugar supply for 2017/18 is decreased by 57,469 short tons, raw value (STRV).  Cane sugar production for 2017/18 is reduced 44,356 STRV to 4.011 million.  Based on industry reporting, processing in Louisiana continued later than usual into late January, and production for the crop year totaled 1.859 million STRV, up 38,644 from last month.  This gain is more than offset by a processor-forecast reduction in Florida cane sugar production of 83,000 STRV.  Beet sugar production is reduced by 37,800 STRV to 5.219 million.  Although the sucrose recovery from sliced sugarbeets in December, as reported in Sweetener Market Data (SMD), is down significantly from the previous month, most of the reduction is expected to be made up based on processor-sourced information.  Increased beginning stocks of 24,687 STRV offset some of the reduced production, as 2016/17 imported sugar originally recorded as a direct consumption import was revised in SMD as raw sugar imported by a refiner. Deliveries for human consumption for 2017/18 are reduced by 75,000 STRV to 12.325 million, based on a slower than expected pace in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The residually determined change in projected ending stocks for 2017/18 is 1.842 million STRV, up 17,531.  The ending stocks-to-use ratio is 14.6 percent, up from 14.4 percent last month.In Mexico, deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 86,626 metric tons (MT) to offset an increase in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) consumption, as per capita sweetener consumption in Mexico remains equal to the level of last year.  The HFCS increase is based on a higher pace-to-date in the fourth quarter of 2017 and expected to continue for the rest of the marketing year, albeit at a slower pace.  Stocks are projected at 22.0 percent of consumption to meet needs before the start of production in 2018/19, implying a reduction of 19,058 MT.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are residually projected at 276,981 MT, an increase of 105,683 over last month. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2018 forecast for total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month, as higher forecast broiler production more than offsets lower beef, pork, and turkey production.  The beef production forecast is reduced from the previous month, as expected lower second-half beef production more than offsets higher first-half beef production.  NASS\u2019s Cattle report, released January 31, estimated the U.S. cattle inventory continued to increase for the fourth consecutive year, but the report also indicated that fewer numbers of cattle were being held outside feedlots.  The number of cattle placed on feed in the first part of 2018 is expected to be lower, resulting in lower marketings and beef production in the second half of the year.  The January NASS Cattle on Feed report showed year-over-year increases in placement numbers in December, implying higher numbers of fed cattle will likely be marketed during the spring quarter.  Cattle weights are raised for the first half of 2018 on current weight patterns.  Pork production is reduced on the pace of slaughter to date.  Broiler production is raised largely on continued growth in bird weights.  First-half turkey production is reduced on hatchery data.  First-quarter egg production is reduced on a slower laying rate.  Estimates of 2017 meat and egg production are adjusted to reflect December data. For 2018, beef exports are raised as demand from several key trading partners is expected to remain robust; no change is made to the beef import forecast.  Pork import and export forecasts are unchanged from last month.  First-half broiler export forecasts are raised on expectations of strong demand while turkey exports are reduced on the slow pace of recovery in exports in late-2017 and lower production in 2018.  Livestock, poultry, and egg trade estimates for 2017 are adjusted to reflect December trade data.Fed-cattle prices for the first half of 2018 are raised from last month on continued demand strength.  First-quarter hog and broiler price forecasts are raised from last month on stronger prices to date.  The first-quarter turkey price is also raised, but the annual forecast remains unchanged.  Egg price forecasts are also raised on continued robust demand. The milk production forecast for 2018 is lowered from last month on expectations of slower growth in milk per cow.  The 2018 fat basis export and import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month.  On a skim-solids basis, the import forecast is raised slightly while the export forecast is raised on strong global demand for skim milk powder, lactose, and whey products.  The 2017 production, trade, and stock estimates are adjusted to reflect December data.Annual product price forecasts for cheese and butter are lowered from the previous month as demand remains relatively weak.  No changes are made to the annual prices for NDM and whey.  The Class III price is lowered on the cheese price projection while the Class IV price is down on a lower butter price forecast.  The all milk price is forecast is reduced to $15.70 to $16.40 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2017/18 U.S. cotton supply and demand forecasts show slightly lower exports and higher ending stocks relative to last month.  Production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  The export forecast is lowered 300,000 bales to 14.5 million based on a lagging pace of shipments to date.  Ending stocks are now estimated at 6.0 million bales, equivalent to 34 percent of total disappearance.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to average between 67 and 71 cents per pound, unchanged from January\u2019s range.The 2017/18 world cotton forecasts include slightly higher production, lower consumption, and higher ending stocks.  World production is 400,000 bales higher than last month, as higher estimates for China, Brazil, and South Africa offset lower expectations for India and Australia.  Global consumption is forecast 325,000 bales lower, as decreases for India and Thailand offset an increase for Vietnam.  World ending stocks are projected 760,000 bales higher as a 1.1-million-bale increase in China\u2019s projected ending stocks\u2014and higher U.S. stocks\u2014offsets declines for India, Australia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Vietnam.",
    "April_2013": "OILSEEDS:  The U.S. soybean crush for 2012/13 is increased 20 million bushels this month to 1.635 billion.  The increase reflects strong soybean meal exports through the first half of the marketing year.  Increased U.S. soybean meal exports partly offset reduced meal exports for Brazil and Argentina as crush in those countries declines more quickly than expected on reduced supplies resulting from last year\u2019s drought.  Soybean exports are projected at 1.35 billion bushels, up 5 million on stronger-than-expected shipments in recent weeks.  Residual use is reduced based on indications from the March 28 Grain Stocks report.  U.S. soybean ending stocks are projected at 125 million bushels, unchanged from last month.  Soybean oil balance sheet adjustments include increased production, food use, and ending stocks.  Increased food use partly offsets reduced imports and consumption of canola oil.  The season-average price range for soybeans is projected at $13.80 to $14.80 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 48 to 50 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $415 to $435 per short ton, down 10 dollars at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2012/13 is projected at 468.8 million tons, up 2 million from last month.  South American soybean production accounts for most of the change.  Paraguay soybean production is forecast at 8.35 million tons, up 0.6 million as higher yields more than offset reduced harvested area.  Projected yields resulting from favorable rainfall and relatively mild temperatures are the highest for Paraguay in the past 10 years.  Uruguay soybean production is also raised this month on higher area and yield.  Uruguay benefitted from the same favorable weather pattern seen in Paraguay and southern Brazil.  Other changes this month include higher rapeseed production for EU-27, higher sunflowerseed production for China, and reduced cottonseed production for Brazil.Global oilseed trade for 2012/13 is projected at 114.4 million tons, down 1.4 million mainly reflecting reduced soybean trade.  Lower soybean exports projected for Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay are only partly offset by increases for Uruguay and the United States.  Lower exports in Paraguay reflect higher crush as new capacity becomes operational.  Soybean imports are reduced 2 million tons to 61 million for China reflecting lower-than-expected imports for the first half of the marketing year.  Higher soybean imports are projected for several countries including Egypt, EU-27, Mexico, and Vietnam.  Global soybean ending stocks are projected at 62.6 million tons, up 2.4 million as gains in Brazil and Argentina more than offset lower stocks in China.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2012/13 is decreased 122,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, as lower production more than offsets higher imports from Mexico. Lower planted area and later seeding of the 2013 sugarbeet crop, compared with last year, reduce expected early harvest and sugar production in August and September.  For 2012/13 sugar use, the strong pace to date supports an increase of 100,000 tons.For Mexico, 2012/13 cane sugar production is increased based on increased sugarcane yields.  Exports are increased both to U.S. and world markets, while higher ending stocks are in line with recent government forecasts.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2013 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month.  Beef production is forecast down as lower expected fed cattle and bull slaughter more than offset greater cow slaughter.  The pork production forecast is raised as the March 28 Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated a slightly higher-than-expected first-quarter pig crop and a smaller decline in the number of sows which farrowed or are expected to farrow in the first half of the year.  Hog carcass weights are also raised as feed prices are forecast lower.  The broiler production forecast is lowered for the first quarter based on production data to date, but subsequent quarters are unchanged.  Turkey production is forecast lower as the turkey price forecast is reduced and hatchery data points to a slowdown in poult placements.  The egg production forecast is lowered, reflecting recent hatchery data. The beef export forecast for 2013 is lowered, reflecting the pace of trade in the first quarter. Beef imports are raised on larger expected supplies in Oceania.  Pork exports are cut as exports to a number of markets are relatively slow.  The broiler export forecast is reduced from last month on expected higher prices. Cattle prices are unchanged from last month.  Hog prices are lowered as greater inventories and weaker forecast exports are expected to pressure prices. Broiler prices are raised on robust current prices and demand.  Turkey price forecasts are lowered as demand has been weaker-than-expected.  The egg price forecast is raised on stronger-than-expected first quarter prices. The milk production forecast for 2013 is reduced on lower milk per cow in the first quarter. Cow numbers are unchanged from last month.  Fat-basis imports are reduced mostly on lower imports of anhydrous products.  The skim solids import forecast is reduced largely on lower expected imports of milk protein concentrates.  Export forecasts are unchanged from last month.  Fat-basis ending stocks are forecast higher, but skim-basis stocks are lowered. With slightly lower forecast 2013 milk production and improved domestic product demand, price forecasts for cheese, butter, NDM, and whey are raised.  As a result, both Class III and Class IV price forecasts are higher than last month. The all milk price for 2013 is higher at $19.45-$19.95 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2012/13 U.S. cotton estimates include offsetting increases in production and exports, resulting in ending stocks of 4.2 million bales, unchanged from last month\u2019s forecast.  Production is raised 280,000 bales based on USDA\u2019s final Cotton Ginnings report, released March 25, 2013.  Domestic mill use is unchanged.  Exports are raised to 13.0 million bales, based on the larger supply and strong export shipments to date.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is now forecast at 70.5 to 73.5 cents per pound, up 0.5 cent on each end of the range, reflecting recent higher prices.The 2012/13 world cotton estimates show higher beginning and ending stocks and sharply higher trade.  Beginning stocks are raised mainly in India due to adjustments to the 2010/11 and 2011/12 balance sheets.  World production is forecast slightly lower as a reduction for Brazil is partially offset by the increase in the United States.  World consumption is raised slightly, as recent data indicate higher consumption for India and Vietnam.  Forecast world trade is raised 1.8 million bales, including a 1.5-million-bale increase for China, based on reported allocations of additional import quotas to mills.  Exports are raised for India, the United States, and Australia, but are lowered for Brazil and Mexico.World 2012/13 ending stocks are now projected at 82.5 million bales, nearly 1 percent above last month.  China\u2019s higher imports are expected to displace potential sales from the massive national reserve, raising stocks there to a projected 45.6 million bales.  Stocks outside of China are projected 2 percent below last month.  ",
    "May_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 114.1 million tons, down 2.6 percent from 2014/15 mainly on lower soybean production.  Soybean production is projected at 3,850 million bushels, down 119 million from the 2014 crop with record harvested area more than offset by lower yields.  Harvested area is projected at 83.7 million acres based on a 5-year average harvested-to-planted ratio and planted area of 84.6 million acres.  The soybean yield is projected at a trend level of 46.0 bushels per acre, down 1.8 bushels from last year\u2019s record.  Supplies are projected at 4,230 million bushels, up 3.4 percent from 2014/15 with increased beginning stocks more than offsetting lower production.The U.S. soybean crush for 2015/16 is projected at 1,825 billion bushels, up 20 million from 2014/15.  U.S. soybean meal use is projected to increase 3.2 percent in line with expected gains in U.S. meat production.  Despite lower prices, soybean meal exports are projected to decline with increased exports from South America and India accounting for most of the gains in global soybean meal trade.  Soybean exports are projected at 1,775 million bushels, down 25 million from 2014/15 despite record supplies.  Competition from record supplies in South America is expected to limit U.S. exports during the first half of the 2015/16 marketing year.  With larger supplies and lower use, U.S. ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 500 million bushels, up 150 million from 2014/15.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2015/16 will decline to $8.25 to $9.75 per bushel compared with $10.05 in 2014/15.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $305 to $345 per short ton compared with $365 in 2014/15.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.5 to 32.5 cents per pound compared with 32.0 cents in 2014/15. Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 531.2 million tons, slightly below 2014/15.  Global soybean production is projected at 317.3 million tons, almost unchanged from 2014/15 with gains for Brazil, India, Paraguay, and Ukraine offset by reductions for the United States, Argentina, and China.  The Argentina soybean crop is projected at 57.0 million tons, down 1.5 million from 2014/15 with higher area but lower yields.  The Brazil soybean crop is projected at a record 97.0 million tons, up 2.5 million on higher area.  China soybean production is projected at 11.5 million tons, down 0.85 million as producers shift to more profitable crops.  Total oilseed supplies are up 2.8 percent from 2014/15.  With crush projected to increase 2.3 percent, global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 107.4 million tons, up 8.3 million from the revised 2014/15 stock estimate. Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.4 percent in 2015/16.  Protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.0 percent in China, accounting for 24 percent of global protein consumption gains.  Global soybean exports are projected at 122 million tons, up 3.8 percent from 2014/15.  China soybean imports are projected at 77.5 million tons, up 4 million from the revised 2014/15 projection.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected to increase 3.6 percent in 2015/16 led by increases for China, India, and Indonesia.SUGAR:  Total production for 2015/16 is forecast at 8.450 million short tons, raw value (STRV), a decrease of 76,000 from 2014/15.  Beet sugar production for the 2015/16 August-July period will total about 4.900 million STRV, but fiscal year 2015/16 production is forecast at 4.770 million as 11 percent of the 2015/16 sugarbeet crop will be harvested in August-September and thus will be accounted for in the estimate of the fiscal year 2014/15 crop.  Cane sugar production is forecast at 3.680 million STRV, down 85,000 as production yields return to trend and area remains about the same as 2014/15.U.S. 2015/16 imports are forecast at 3.810 million STRV.  Tariff-rate quota imports are forecast at statutory levels consistent with international agreements.  Shortfall is forecast at 99,208 STRV, the same as estimated for 2014/15.  The additional specialty sugar TRQ has not been established and is set at zero.  Imports from Mexico are forecast at 2.116 million STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are forecast at 11.985 million STRV, 126,000 higher than 2014/15.  Ending stocks are forecast at 1.547 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.6 percent.Mexico 2015/16 sugar production is forecast at 6.000 million metric tons (MT), the same as 2014/15 but assuming about 20,000 fewer hectares to be harvested and a greater sugar yield per harvested hectare. Exports to the United States for 2015/16 are forecast at 1.811 million MT, based on the terms of the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Needs\u201d).  Although the U.S. additional specialty sugar TRQ has not been established, for purposes of the U.S. Needs calculation, it is assumed at the same level as in 2014/15.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2015/16 are forecast at 4.250 million MT, the same as in 2014/15.  Ending stocks are forecast residually at 667,604 MT, implying a lower than historical average stocks-to-consumption ratio of 15.7 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production in 2016 is projected to be above 2015.  Beef production is forecast higher as gains in the 2014 and 2015 calf crops support year-over-year increases in cattle placements in late 2015 and early 2016.  Marketings of fed cattle are forecast to increase during 2016, while carcass weights are expected to reflect incentives to keep cattle weights high.  Pork production is expected to increase as pig crops expand; reflecting moderate increases in farrowings during late 2015 and early 2016 and a continued recovery in growth in pigs per litter.  Broiler and turkey production are forecast higher as the more rapid expansion in production which began in late 2014 continues.  Egg production for 2016 is forecast to expand as producers respond to favorable egg prices and moderate feed costs.   The total red meat and poultry production forecast for 2015 is raised from last month on higher beef, pork, and broiler production.  Beef production is raised on heavier dressed weights.  Pork production is forecast higher as the pace of slaughter in the second quarter remains heavy and supplies of slaughter hogs in the second part of the year are expected to remain ample.  Broiler production is raised from last month as producers continue to expand egg sets and chicks placed.  Turkey production is lowered from last month as previously forecast production growth is expected to be limited.  Egg production for 2015 is lowered as recent discoveries of HPAI will constrain production growth.  Red meat and poultry exports are expected to increase in 2016 with expanding production.  Imports of beef and pork are expected to decline.  For 2015, export forecasts for beef, pork, and broiler meat are raised from last month on March export data and larger production forecasts.  Beef imports are forecast higher on strong processing-grade beef demand and tight supplies of domestic processing beef.  Pork imports are lowered with expected increases in production.For 2016, fed cattle prices are forecast near 2015 levels as supplies increase but demand for fed cattle remains robust.  Hog prices are forecast to be lower than 2015 as hog supplies increase.  However, broiler and turkey prices are forecast higher despite increased production as demand improves and beef supplies remain tight.  Egg prices are forecast higher on firm demand.  The fed cattle price forecast for 2015 is lowered from last month.  Hog prices are reduced slightly.  Broiler prices are forecast higher as demand remains strong.  Turkey prices are raised based on current strength in prices and reduced production.  Egg prices are unchanged.  Milk production for 2016 is forecast higher as improved forage availability and moderate feed costs are expected to support gains in milk per cow.  Cow numbers are forecast slightly higher.  Commercial exports on both a fat and skim-solids basis are forecast higher with a resumption of normal trade patterns.  Imports are forecast lower as domestic production increases and demand from competing importers is higher.  With stronger domestic demand and export, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey prices are forecast higher, but butter prices are forecast lower as strong NDM demand is expected to support relatively high levels of butter production.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are forecast higher.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.45 to $18.45 per cwt for 2016.Forecast milk production in 2015 is forecast lower than last month as drought in the West impacts milk per cow and growth in the cow herd is expected to be slower.  Fat and skim-solids imports are raised on strong demand for imported cheeses.  Fat basis exports are raised on better-than-expected March exports.  Skim-solids exports are higher based on higher NDM and lactose shipments.  Cheese, NDM, and whey prices are forecast lower on weaker demand, but the butter price forecast is raised on strong demand.  The Class III price is lowered on weaker cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is lower as the stronger butter price is more than offset by the reduced prices for NDM.  The milk price is forecast to average $17.10 to $17.60 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton 2015/16 projections include marginally higher supply and disappearance compared with 2014/15, resulting in ending stocks and prices on par with the preceding year.  The increase in beginning stocks of nearly 2.0 million bales is mostly offset by an 11-percent decrease in production, due mainly to reduced planted area.  Harvested acres and yields are based on historical averages by region, with adjustments to the Southwest to reflect favorable moisture conditions.  Domestic mill use is projected higher while exports are at the prior year\u2019s 10.7 million bales.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to range from 50 to 70 cents per pound, with the midpoint of 60 cents, unchanged from the current season.   World 2015/16 cotton projections show a decline in global stocks for the first time since 2009/10.  As with the U.S. estimates, higher beginning stocks compared with last season are about offset by sharply lower world production, as most of the world\u2019s cotton-producing countries respond to lower prices.  World consumption is raised 3.5 percent due mainly to positive world economic growth and the lagged effect of falling cotton prices during 2014/15.  World trade is reduced marginally, as a sharp drop of 1.7 million bales in China\u2019s imports is mostly offset by increases in other countries.  China\u2019s lower production and imports, combined with a consumption increase of nearly 3 percent, are projected to reduce ending stocks by about 3.0 million bales, accounting for more than three-fourths of the decline in world stocks.  Despite this reduction, world stocks of 106.3 million bales would still be the second highest on record.For 2014/15, U.S. production is raised marginally, based on lower harvested area and higher yields, reflecting the season final report.  Slightly higher world ending stocks incorporate a number of current and historical data adjustments, resulting in increases for Argentina, China, and Benin, partially offset by decreases for India, Malaysia, and Brazil.",
    "August_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 120.2 million tons, up 4.8 million from last month due to a higher soybean production forecast.  Soybean production for 2016/17 is forecast at 4,060 million bushels, up 180 million due to increased yields.  Harvested area is forecast at 83.0 million acres, unchanged from the July projection.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 48.9 bushels per acre is 2.2 bushels above last month and 0.9 bushels above last year\u2019s record.  With higher production only partly offset by lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies for 2016/17 are projected at a record 4,346 million bushels.  Soybean crush is raised 15 million bushels based on expected higher domestic use and exports of soybean meal.  Soybean exports are raised 30 million bushels to 1,950 million.  Despite higher use, soybean ending stocks are projected at 330 million bushels, up 40 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2016/17 is forecast at $8.35 to $9.85 per bushel, down 40 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $305 to $345 per short ton, down 20 dollars at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 to 32.5 cents per pound.U.S. changes for 2015/16 include increased soybean crush and exports, and lower ending stocks.  The soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,900 million reflecting increased domestic use and exports of soybean meal.  Soybean exports are raised 85 million bushels to 1,880 million as unusually large outstanding old-crop sales are confirmed by the latest shipment data.  With increased use, 2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 255 million bushels, down 95 million from last month.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 543.5 million tons, up 7.0 million from last month.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 330.4 million tons, up 4.5 million.  The U.S. production increase is partly offset by reductions for both India and Ukraine with the latest planting data for both countries indicating lower forecasts for harvested area.  Rapeseed production is raised for Canada where abundant moisture and favorable temperatures in July helped to boost yield prospects.  Partly offsetting is a reduction for EU rapeseed production on excessive moisture in key growing areas, particularly in France.  Other changes include increased sunflowerseed production for Russia and Ukraine, increased peanut production for India and Senegal, increased cottonseed production for China, and reduced cottonseed production for India.  For 2015/16, global vegetable oil trade is expected to decline 1.5 million tons from last month due to lower palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia.Global oilseed supplies for 2016/17 are raised 8.1 million tons with increased production and higher beginning stocks.  With larger supplies only partly offset by increased crush, 2016/17 global oilseed stocks are projected at 80.6 million tons, up 4.5 million from last month.SUGAR:  Sugar production for the fiscal year 2016/17 is increased 247,901 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 9.208 million resulting from new sugar crop forecasts made by NASS in the August Crop Production report.  Beet sugar is increased 128,160 STRV based on higher sugar per acre implied by the NASS sugarbeet yield forecast although area harvested is down slightly.  Cane sugar production in Florida is increased by 47,786 STRV and in Louisiana by 71,955 based on higher sugar-per-acre yields implied by NASS sugarcane yield forecasts in both States. Beginning stocks for 2016/17 are increased by 35,012 STRV due to changes made to two import estimates for 2015/16 that flowed into the ending stock estimate.  Re-export imports for 2015/16 are increased by 50,000 STRV to 350,000 based on pace to date.  Partially offsetting is an increase in 2015/16 raw sugar tariff-rate quota shortfall of 14,988 STRV. The only other change for 2016/17 is a reduction in re-export imports of 50,000 STRV to 125,000.  With no change expected for 2016/17 sugar exports, deliveries for re-export sugar-containing products, or polyhydric alcohol manufacturing, the imports for re-export reduction offsets the increase made for 2015/16.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 increase to 1.887 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use of 15.4 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2015/16 is estimated at 6.117 million metric tons (MT), a small reduction from last month based on final industry reporting.  Deliveries for 2015/16 to the sugar-containing product export IMMEX program are increased by 75,283 MT to 330,000 based on increases in the pace of deliveries to the program by domestic producers.  Deliveries to IMMEX in 2016/17 are expected to match the level in 2015/16, thereby resulting in an increase of 75,283 MT as well.  LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total red meat and poultry production for 2016 is reduced from last month as increased beef and turkey production is more than offset by lower forecast pork and broiler production.  Beef production is forecast higher on higher expected third quarter steer and heifer slaughter.  However, second quarter production is adjusted lower to reflect June production data.  Pork production for 2016 is lowered on expectations of slightly lighter carcass weights for the remainder of the year.  Broiler production is lowered on slower expected growth in the fourth quarter.  Turkey production is raised for 2016, largely on June production data.  Production forecasts for 2017 red meat and poultry are raised as lower forecast feed prices are expected to encourage increased production.  Table egg production is raised for 2016 on June production data; the 2017 forecast is unchanged. The beef import forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised in part due to expectations of increased imports from Brazil beginning in the later part of 2016.  Beef exports for 2016 are lowered based on June trade data; no change is made to the 2017 forecast.  Small adjustments are made to pork trade based on June data; no change is made to the forecasts.  Broiler exports for 2016 are lowered due to a slower pace of exports in June; no change is made to 2017.  No change is made to turkey exports.Cattle, hog, and broiler prices for second-half 2016 are reduced from last month on weakness in current prices.  Prices for cattle, hogs and broilers for 2017 are reduced from last month as production is forecast higher; however, the annual price range for cattle is unchanged.  Turkey prices are raised for the third quarter of 2016 but are unchanged for 2017.  Egg prices are lowered for 2016 and 2017.The milk production forecast for 2016 is lowered from last month as growth in milk per cow is reduced.  However, the production forecast for 2017 is raised as higher forecast milk prices and lower feed costs in late 2016 and 2017 are expected to lead to a modest expansion in the cow inventory and more rapid growth in milk per cow.  Fat basis exports are raised for 2016 on continued strength in whole milk powder (WMP) exports.  The forecast for 2017 is unchanged.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised on higher sales of WMP and whey products.  Imports are raised for 2016 and 2017 as imports of fat-containing products has increased.  Fat basis stocks are forecast higher as stocks of butter remain high, but on a skim-solids basis, stocks are reduced.Cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey prices for 2016 are forecast higher as demand remains firm, but the forecast for butter price is reduced as stocks remain larger than expected.  The Class III price is raised, reflecting higher cheese and whey prices, but the Class IV price is lowered as the lower butter price more than offsets the higher NDM price.  For 2017, prices of cheese, butter, and whey are increased, but NDM is unchanged from last month.  The Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised on the stronger component prices.  The all milk prices are forecast higher at $16.25 to $16.45 per cwt for 2016 and $16.15 to $17.15 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  The 2016/17 U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates include marginally higher production and ending stocks, with the farm price projected 7 percent above last month.  Production is forecast at 15.9 million bales based on NASS\u2019s first survey of the 2016 crop.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged from last month, raising ending stocks to 4.7 million bales, equivalent to 31 percent of total use.  The marketing year average price received by producers is projected to range from 57 to 69 cents per pound.  The midpoint of 63 cents per pound is raised 4 cents from last month\u2019s estimate based on recent price activity and tighter global cotton supplies.Projected world 2016/17 cotton ending stocks are down 2 percent this month, due to combination of lower beginning stocks and production.  Beginning stocks are reduced by 1.1 million bales, due mainly to revisions in China, India, and Australia.  Production is reduced for China, India, Mexico, and Argentina, partially offset by an increase for Brazil.  Global consumption and imports are estimated marginally lower, mainly reflecting reductions in Vietnam and Pakistan.  Exports are reduced for Brazil.  World ending stocks are lowered 1.7 million bales to 89.6 million.  Stocks outside of the United States and China are projected at 36 percent of total use, similar to the estimated 2015/16 ratio.",
    "December_2021": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2021/22 is forecast at 130.3 million tons, up slightly due to an increase for cottonseed.  Soybean supply and use projections for 2021/22 are unchanged from last month.  Although soybean crush is unchanged, soybean oil production is raised on a higher extraction rate.  With increased soybean oil supplies, food, feed, and other industrial use of soybean oil is raised, offsetting lower consumption of canola and cottonseed oils.  Based on a review of EPA's proposed rule for 2020-2022 renewable fuel obligation targets, soybean oil used for biofuel for 2021/22 is unchanged at 11 billion pounds.  The U.S. season-average soybean and soybean oil price forecasts for 2021/22 are unchanged at $12.10 per bushel and 65.0 cents per pound, respectively.  The soybean meal price forecast is increased $5.00 to $330.00 per short ton.The 2021/22 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production and lower ending stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production is projected at 627.6 million tons, down 0.4 million from last month mainly driven by lower soybean production reported by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.  China\u2019s soybean production is down 2.6 million tons to 16.4 million on lower area.  Largely offsetting China\u2019s reduction is higher sunflower and soybean output for Russia and Ukraine based on harvest results.  Rapeseed production is increased for Australia and lowered for Canada based on recent government reports, and India\u2019s production is increased on a faster-than-expected planting pace.  Global crush is reduced as lower soybean crush for China more than offsets higher sunflowerseed crush for Russia and Ukraine.Global oilseed trade for 2021/22 is projected at 196.0 million tons, up 0.5 million from last month.  Increased rapeseed exports for Australia and increased soybean exports for Canada and Ukraine account for most of the gains.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 114.1 million tons, down 1.1 million from last month mainly on lower soybean stocks for China.SUGAR:  The U.S. sugar supply and use balance for 2020/21 is revised on data revisions made in Sweetener Market Data (SMD).  A cane refiner decreased its raw sugar imports for August by 26,295 short tons, raw value (STRV), implying the same sized reduction in ending stocks to 1,701,915.  The cane refiner revision, along with a small reduction in total imports (277 STRV) based on U.S. Census trade data, results in a 26,018 STRV increase in Direct Consumption Imports (904,298 STRV) and consequently in deliveries for human consumption (12,135,184 STRV).  The ending stocks-to-use ratio is decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 13.8 percent. Louisiana cane sugar production for 2021/22 is decreased by 71,592 STRV to 1,712,238 on the NASS 4.1 percent reduction in sugarcane yield.  U.S. beet sugar production is decreased by 19,871 STRV to 5,393,301.  Although SMD reports that U.S. beet processors increased their estimate of sugarbeets harvested (yield increase of 3.6 percent only partially offset by a decrease in area harvested of 3.3 percent), total sugarbeets projected for slicing decreased by 135,207 tons to 33,956,053 due to higher forecast shrink.  USDA did not change sucrose recovery, sugar from desugared molasses, or 2022 August-September production in projecting production for the fiscal year.  USDA can be expected to revise its projection of sucrose recovery next month when slice data through the end of November becomes available from beet processors.  Because the slice data prior to November (August-October) is insufficient for forecasting full season sucrose recovery, the average of recoveries from the 5 preceding years is used until January. Imports for 2021/22 are increased by 30,812 STRV to 3,075,895.  High-tier tariff imports are increased by 50,000 STRV on the basis of actual entries of sugar through the beginning of December and an increase in the projected pace of refined sugar imports.  Based on Customs reporting, imports of raw sugar at the high-tier tariff for October 1 through December 3 are 62,493 STRV.  Imports of refined sugar for the same period are 15,179 STRV.  USDA projects that monthly refined high-tier tariff imports will average about 7,250 STRV December through September.  (The average for October-November was 7,590 STRV and the average for January-November was 12,585 STRV.)  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 19,188 STRV to 1,064,712 as detailed below in the discussion on the Mexico supply and use.  There are no changes from last month for sugar use.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 1,678,349 STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.6 percent. Mexico supply and use for both 2020/21 and 2021/22 are unchanged from last month.  Exports to the United States for 2021/22 are projected at 911,218 metric tons (MT), a decrease of 16,422 from last month.  Calculated U.S. Needs implied by the December 2021 U.S. Sugar WASDE as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements is 900,253 MT (1,051,901 STRV).  This amount exceeds the Export Limit of 777,723 MT (908,730 STRV) established by the Department of Commerce (DOC) on November 23, 2021.  There is an additional export amount of 10,965 MT (12,812 STRV) from the 2020/21 export allocation to Mexico that was permitted by DOC to enter the United States after September 30.  Because total Mexico exports for 2021/22 are unchanged from last month at 1,777,193 MT, shipments other than to the United States under export license increase by 16,422 MT to 865,976.Mexico supply and use for both 2020/21 and 2021/22 are unchanged from last month.

The beef production forecast is raised on higher fed cattle slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Pork production is increased on the current pace of hog slaughter.  Broiler production is reduced on recent hatchery and slaughter data while the turkey production forecast is lowered on recent slaughter data.  Egg production is forecast lower on recent production data. For 2022, total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month.  Beef production is unchanged from the previous month while pork production is raised on heavier carcass weights.  Broiler production is raised as higher prices are expected to support expanding production.  Turkey production is lowered from last month.  Egg production is raised on higher hatching egg production.Beef import forecasts are raised for 2021 and 2022 but no change is made to the export forecasts.  The 2021 pork export forecast is reduced from last month largely on weaker import demand from China.  Broiler exports are unchanged for 2021, but forecasts are raised for 2022 on stronger expected demand.  Turkey exports for both 2021 and 2022 are lowered modestly on recent trade data.The cattle price forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are raised on current price strength and expectations of continued demand strength into next year.  The fourth-quarter hog price is reduced on recent prices, but no change is made to 2022 hog prices.  The 2021 and 2022 broiler price forecasts are raised from last month on current prices and expectations that demand will remain firm.  The 2021 turkey price is reduced on recent prices, but 2022 prices are raised on tighter expected supplies.  The milk production forecasts are projected lower for 2021 and 2022 on lower expected dairy cow numbers and slower growth in milk per cow.  The 2021 fat basis import forecast is raised on higher imports of cheese and butterfat products while the export forecast is lowered on weaker sales of butterfat products.  The 2021 skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged, but the export forecast is raised on stronger global demand for lactose.  For 2022, the fat basis and skim solid import forecasts are unchanged.  The fat basis export forecast is raised due to stronger shipments of butterfat.  The skim-solids basis export forecast is raised on larger shipments of lactose and other dairy products.Butter, cheese, and whey price forecasts for 2021 are raised from last month on current prices and strength in demand.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecast for 2021 is unchanged.  The 2021 Class III price forecast is raised on higher cheese and whey prices and the Class IV price forecast is raised on the higher butter price.  The 2021 all milk price forecast is raised to $18.60 per cwt.  For 2022, cheese, butter, NDM, and whey price forecasts are raised on lower expected milk supplies.  Class III and Class IV price forecasts for 2022 are raised on higher forecast dairy product prices.  The all milk price for 2022 is raised to $20.75 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton 2021/22 supply and demand forecasts are largely unchanged this month, with only a slight increase in production.  The U.S. production forecast is raised about 0.5 percent as higher yields in other regions offset lower yields for the Southwest.  U.S. exports, mill use, and ending stocks are unchanged from their November forecasts.  Upland cotton\u2019s projected season-average price is also unchanged from November, at 90 cents per pound, 36 percent above its year-earlier level.Projected 2021/22 world cotton ending stocks are 1.2 million bales lower this month due to lower beginning stocks, lower production, and slightly higher consumption.  Historical adjustments to Indian production over 2018-2020 reflect updated official estimates from India, resulting in a net 500,000-bale decline in 2021/22 beginning stocks there, and accounting for most of a 700,000-bale decline in global beginning stocks.  Projected world production in 2021/22 is 200,000 bales lower this month as a 1.0 million bale drop in Pakistan more than offsets gains in Benin, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Cameroon.  World cotton trade is forecast 300,000 bales higher this month as higher expected imports for Pakistan, Vietnam, and smaller markets in Central America and Southeast Asia more than offset a 250,000-bale decline for China.  Exports are projected higher for Brazil and the Franc Zone.",
    "December_2020": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2020/21 is projected at 123.7 million tons, down from last month on lower cottonseed production.  Soybean crush for 2020/21 is increased 15 million bushels to 2.195 billion on strong crush margins and record early-season crush.  With exports unchanged, soybean ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 175 million bushels.  If realized, ending stocks would be the lowest since 2013/14.Soybean and soybean product prices are forecast higher this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2020/21 is projected at $10.55 per bushel, up 15 cents.  The soybean meal price is projected at $370 per short ton, up 15 dollars.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 36 cents per pound, up 1.5 cents with cash prices reaching the highest level in the past six years.The 2020/21 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include lower production, higher exports, and lower ending stocks.  Global oilseed production is projected at 595.7 million tons, down 1.6 million from last month, with lower soybeans, rapeseed, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed.  Global soybean production is projected down 0.6 million tons to 362.1 million.  Higher soybean crops for Canada and Uruguay are offset by lower production for Argentina, which is reduced 1 million tons to 50 million on lower harvested area.  Lower production for Argentina leads to lower crush and soybean meal exports, supporting higher U.S. exports.  Global rapeseed production is projected lower as reduced estimates for Canada and the EU are partly offset by a larger Australian crop.  Global sunflowerseed production is projected down 0.2 million tons to 49.5 million, with lower crops for Argentina and the EU.Global oilseed trade for 2020/21 is projected at 191.8 million tons, up 1.0 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports for Canada and Uruguay and increased rapeseed exports for Canada and Australia account for most of the gains.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 97.8 million tons, down 0.8 million from last month.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar supply for 2020/21 is increased 357,525 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 14.006 million on projected increases in imports more than compensating for production decreases and a slight reduction in beginning stocks.  Imports are projected to increase 403,706 STRV to 3.428 million.  The largest increase is for imports from Mexico.  These are increased by 271,750 STRV to 1.160 million.  Raw sugar 2019/20 TRQ entering in October 2020 has been revised upward by 96,956 STRV for a total of 248,854 STRV.  After the publication of USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data this month, FAS resolved certain anomalies in Customs reporting for TRQ entries.  Additional sugar not recorded for October sourced from Australia, Brazil, and several other countries was determined to have entered.  As a consequence of this adjustment, raw sugar TRQ imports for 2020/21 are projected at 1.381 million STRV, and the 2019/20 raw sugar TRQ shortfall is estimated at 84,180 STRV.  High-tier tariff imports for 2020/21 are increased by 35,000 STRV to 110,000 on the pace to date.Beet sugar production is reduced by 40,396 STRV to 4.859 million on processors\u2019 forecasts of national sugarbeet production lower than that forecast last month by NASS.  Although NASS increased Louisiana sugarcane yield 7.4 percent to 32.0 tons/acre, cane sugar production is unchanged due to the slower-than-expected pace during the hurricane-affected early weeks of the campaign and the planned extension of harvest end dates to accommodate the large crop.  There are no changes to 2020/21 use.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected residually at 1.666 million STRV implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.50 percent.Sugar supply in Mexico for 2020/21 is up on increased imports of sugar for consumption in the amount of 19,000 metric tons (MT).  This increase is based on FAS Post analysis.  Total imports are projected at 105,000 MT, of which 40,000 are for consumption and 65,000 for IMMEX.  There are no other supply changes.  Exports are residually increased by the same 19,000 MT.  Exports to the United States are increased to 992,683 MT on calculated U.S. Needs as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements.  Exports to third-country destinations are residually decreased to 496,824 MT. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total red meat and poultry production for 2020 is little changed from last month as higher beef and pork production nearly offsets lower poultry production.  The beef production forecast is raised as higher non-fed cattle slaughter more than offsets lighter expected cattle carcass weights.  Pork production is increased on the current pace of slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Broiler production is reduced on recent hatchery and slaughter data while the turkey production forecast is lowered on recent slaughter data.  The egg production forecast is raised.For 2021, total red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month as lower forecast beef and poultry production more that offsets slightly higher pork production.  Beef production is reduced on lower expected fed and non-fed cattle slaughter in the first half of 2021.  Pork production is raised on heavier carcass weights.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are reduced on recent hatchery data. Based on recent trade data, the beef import forecast for 2020 is reduced from last month, but the pork import forecast is raised.  Beef and pork export forecasts are unchanged for 2020 and 2021.  Broiler and turkey exports for 2020 and 2021 are raised on recent trade data and anticipated strong global import demand from key trading partners.  The cattle price forecast for 2020 is reduced on current price weakness but is raised for 2021.  The fourth-quarter hog price is raised on recent prices; no change is made to 2021 hog prices.  The 2020 and 2021 broiler price forecasts are raised from last month on current prices and lower supply expectations.  The 2020 turkey price is reduced, but no change is made to the 2021 forecast.  The egg price forecasts for 2020 and 2021 are lowered on recent prices and expectations of weaker demand.Milk production is projected higher for 2020, on higher cow numbers.  The 2020 fat basis import forecast is reduced on lower imports of butterfat products while the fat basis export forecast is lowered on weaker foreign demand for cheese.  The 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged, but the export forecast is raised on strong global demand for whey and whey products.  For 2021, milk production is raised on higher cow numbers.  The fat basis import forecast is reduced on lower expected imports of a number of dairy products, but the export forecast is raised.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged, but the export forecast is raised on larger shipments of nonfat dry milk powder and dry whey products. Based on recent price movements, cheese and butter price forecasts for 2020 are lowered, but the whey price is raised.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is unchanged.  For 2021, cheese and butter price forecasts are reduced on weaker expected demand and larger supplies, but NDM and whey prices are raised.  The 2020 Class III price forecast is lowered as the weaker cheese price more than offsets higher whey price projections; the Class IV price is also lowered from last month on the lower butter price.  For 2021, forecasts of both Class III and Class IV are reduced from last month on weaker prices for cheese and butter respectively.  The 2020 all milk price is unchanged at $18.25 per cwt; the 2021 all milk price is lowered to $16.60 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s outlook for U.S. cotton includes lower production, higher exports, and lower ending stocks.  Production is lowered 1.1 million bales, mainly due to a 900,000-bale reduction in Texas.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are raised 400,000 bales to 15.0 million as world consumption and U.S. export sales rise.  Ending stocks are 1.5 million bales lower, at 5.7 million or 33 percent of use.  This stocks-to-use ratio would be 8 percentage points lower than in 2019/20, and the second highest since 2007/08.  Upland cotton\u2019s projected 2020/21 season-average price is 65.0 cents per pound, 1 cent higher than last month and 5.4 cents above 2019/20.Projected world 2020/21 ending stocks are 3.9 million bales lower this month, reflecting lower production and higher consumption.  A 2.2-million-bale decline in global production is led by lower U.S. output and includes 500,000-bale reductions in both India and Pakistan, in addition to other smaller adjustments.  Consumption is projected 1.6 million bales higher, and at 115.6 million bales, is expected 13 percent above 2019/20\u2019s depressed level.  Compared to last month, 2020/21 consumption forecasts are 1.0 million bales higher for India and 500,000 bales higher for China, with smaller changes for Pakistan and Thailand.  World trade in 2020/21 is projected more than 300,000 bales higher this month, with increased imports for China and Pakistan more than offsetting lower forecasts for Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia.  World ending stocks are now forecast at 97.5 million bales, 1.9 million lower than in 2019/20.  ",
    "August_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 130.9 million tons, up 3.9 million from last month mainly due to higher soybean production.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,381 million bushels, up 121 million on higher yields.  Harvested area is forecast at 88.7 million acres, unchanged from July.  The first survey-based soybean yield forecast of 49.4 bushels per acre is 1.4 bushels above last month but 2.7 below last year\u2019s record.  With higher production and lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies for 2017/18 are projected at 4,777 million bushels, up 2 percent from last month.  U.S. soybean exports are raised 75 million bushels to 2,225 million on increased supplies and lower prices.  Crush is reduced on lower global soybean meal import demand.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 475 million bushels, up 15 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2017/18 is forecast at $8.45 to $10.15 per bushel, down 10 cents at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price forecast of $295 to $335 per short ton is down $5.00 at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 31 to 35 cents per pound, up 1 cent on both ends of the range.U.S. changes for 2016/17 include higher exports, lower crush, and lower ending stocks.  Soybean exports are raised 50 million bushels to 2,150 million on outstanding export sales and shipments through July.  With lower crush only partly offsetting higher exports, ending stocks are projected at 370 million bushels, down 40 million from last month.Global oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 576.7 million tons, up 2.8 million, mainly on a 2.3-million-ton increase for soybean production.  The higher U.S. forecast was partly offset with a 1.5-million-ton reduction for India based on the latest government planting data indicating lower harvested area.  Soybean and canola production is projected down for Canada, where hot and dry weather conditions in the Canadian Prairies lowered yield prospects for both crops, and excessive rainfall in eastern Canada led to a lower soybean harvested area estimate.  Other changes include increased sunflowerseed production for Russia, increased rapeseed production for the EU, and lower peanut production for India.Global soybean exports for 2017/18 are up 1.5 million tons as higher U.S. exports are partly offset by lower Argentina shipments.  Beginning stocks for 2017/18 are raised based on lower crush and exports for Argentina for 2016/17.  Coupled with higher production, 2017/18 soybean ending stocks are increased 4.3 million tons to 97.8 million.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for the 2017/18 August-July crop year is increased by 89,500 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.131 million based on area and sugarbeet yield forecasts made by NASS in Crop Production report.  Early-season production occurring in August and September is projected to constitute 10.7 percent of the total.  Revised fiscal 2016/17 production of 4.998 million STRV incorporates the updated early season production.  The projection for fiscal 2017/18 is 5.068 million STRV, up 80,000 from last month.  Although NASS forecasts reduced area harvested for both Florida and Louisiana sugarcane, forecast yields in both states are up strongly over last year.  Florida cane sugar production for 2017/18 is increased by 126,000 STRV to 2.126 million and Louisiana is increased by 26,000 STRV to 1.626 million. USDA increased the 2016/17 raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) by 269,724 STRV and extended the time under which the sugar can enter by an additional month to October 31, in the 2017/18 fiscal year.  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative allocated this amount and reallocated existing, but yet unshipped, raw sugar TRQ among supplying countries.  It is estimated that an additional 148,470 STRV of TRQ raw sugar will enter in 2016/17 and 161,499 STRV in 2017/18.  Sugar imported from Mexico is projected to increase by 103,932 STRV in 2016/17 after the Commerce Department increased the 2016/17 Export Limit but is reduced by nearly that same amount in 2017/18 due to lower beginning stocks in Mexico.  Re-export imports of 25,000 STRV previously estimated to enter in 2016/17 are now projected to enter in 2017/18.  High-tier tariff imports for 2016/17 are reduced to 10,000 STRV, based on the pace to date. Mexico 2016/17 sugar imports and deliveries for consumption are up fractionally based on the pace to date.  Deliveries in 2017/18 are increased marginally to keep sweetener consumption per capita the same as in 2016/17.  Exports to the United States in 2016/17 are increased by 88,949 MT to match the Export Limit increase made by the Commerce Department.  These adjustments for 2016/17 imply a reduction in ending stocks of 86,577 MT.  Exports to the United States for 2017/18 are residually projected at 1.466 million MT, an amount 94,091 lower than projected last month.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2017 is raised from last month, as increases in commercial beef and broiler production more than offset declines in pork and turkey production.  The increase in beef production reflects relatively large cattle placements in the second quarter which will likely impact fourth quarter cattle slaughter.  Second quarter broiler production is raised slightly based on June production data, but no change is made to the outlying quarters.  Pork production is reduced on lower expected slaughter in the third quarter.  Forecast turkey production is reduced on a slower-than-expected recovery in demand and relatively poor returns to producers.  Egg production is increased modestly on recent hatchery data.  For 2018, the beef production forecast is raised from the previous month, as expected higher placements in late 2017 and early 2018 result in higher steer and heifer slaughter.  Pork, poultry, and egg production forecasts for 2018 are unchanged from the previous month. For 2017, beef imports are raised, as higher-than-expected shipments of lean processing beef from Oceania in June are expected to carry into the third quarter.  The beef export forecast is lowered from last month on recent trade data and an expected slowdown in global demand for the remainder of 2017.  Pork imports are raised slightly on recent trade data.  The second quarter pork export forecast is adjusted for June data, but the forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged.  The broiler export forecast is reduced on weak foreign demand.  Turkey exports are adjusted to reflect June data.  For 2018, the beef import forecast is unchanged from the previous month while exports are lowered slightly.  Pork, poultry, and egg trade forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. Fed cattle prices are reduced in 2017 and 2018 as current prices have weakened and larger expected supplies of fed cattle are expected to pressure prices.  Hog price forecasts are raised for 2017 and 2018 on continued strength in demand.  The annual broiler price forecast for 2017 is raised, but the price forecast for 2018 is unchanged.  The turkey price forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are lowered on slow recovery in demand.  The egg price forecast for 2017 is raised, but no changes are made to the 2018 price forecast.  The milk production forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are reduced from the previous month as slow growth in milk per cow more than offsets increases in dairy cow numbers.  For 2017, fat basis exports are raised from the previous month on higher butter and anhydrous milk fat shipments.  Fat basis imports are unchanged.  The skim-solid basis export forecast for 2017 is lowered on weaker than expected whey sales.  The import forecast is unchanged.  For 2018, fat basis exports are raised on stronger shipments of a number of dairy products.  Fat basis imports are lowered slightly. Skim-solid basis exports are raised on expected stronger sales of nonfat dry milk (NDM) and other dairy products while imports are unchanged from last month. Butter and cheese price forecasts are raised for 2017 and 2018 as demand strength is expected to carry into 2018.  The 2017 and 2018 NDM and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month on weak demand.  The 2017 Class III price forecast is unchanged at the midpoint, but the 2018 price is lowered as lower whey prices more than offset higher cheese prices.  Class IV price forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are raised as stronger forecast butter prices more than offset lower NDM prices.  The all milk price is raised to $17.80 to $18.00 per cwt for 2017, but is unchanged at $18.00 to $19.00 per cwt for 2018.COTTON:  The first survey of U.S. 2017 crop production indicates a crop of 20.5 million bales, 1.5 million above last month and the largest production in 11 years.  The larger crop is partially offset by lower beginning stocks which are reduced 400,000 bales to 2.8 million due to an increase in final 2016/17 exports.  Domestic mill use for 2017/18 is lowered 50,000 bales, but exports are raised 700,000 based on the larger supply and strong early-season commitments.  Ending stocks are now projected at 5.8 million bales which, if realized, would be the largest since 2008/09.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 55 to 67 cents per pound is narrowed 1 cent on each end, with the midpoint unchanged at 61 cents.Sharply larger production is raising this month\u2019s 2017/18 global stock forecasts.  World production is increased 1.9 million bales, as higher production in the United States, China, and Benin is partially offset by a reduction for Turkey.  The forecast for China\u2019s crop is raised 500,000 bales mainly on higher area.  World consumption for 2017/18 is forecast 375,000 bales higher this month, largely due to a 500,000-bale increase for China.  At 3.3 percent, growth in world cotton consumption in 2017/18 is projected at its highest rate in 5 years.  World 2017/18 ending stocks are now projected at 90.1 million bales, an increase of 1.4 million from the July forecast, and 100,000 above 2016/17.   ",
    "May_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 107.9 million tons, up 11 percent from 2013/14.  Higher soybean production accounts for most of the increase.  Soybean production is projected at a record 3.635 billion bushels, up 346 million from the 2013 crop on record yields and harvested area.  Yield is projected at a trend level of 45.2 bushels per acre, up 1.9 bushels from 2013.  Supplies are projected at 3.78 billion bushels, up 7.4 percent from 2013/14 as a larger crop more than offsets lower beginning stocks and imports.The U.S. soybean crush for 2014/15 is projected at 1.715 billion bushels, up 20 million from 2013/14 mainly reflecting increased domestic soybean meal consumption.  Despite lower prices, soybean meal exports are projected up only slightly with Argentina soybean meal exports accounting for most of the gains in global soybean meal trade.  U.S. soybean exports are projected at 1.625 billion bushels, up 25 million from 2013/14 on record supplies and competitive prices.  Despite gains in use, ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 330 million bushels, up 200 million from 2013/14, increasing the stocks-to-use ratio to 9.6 percent.  The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2014/15 is forecast to decline to $9.75 to $11.75 per bushel compared with $13.10 per bushel in 2013/14.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $355 to $395 per short ton, compared with $485 per ton for 2013/14.  Soybean oil prices are forecast at 37 to 41 cents per pound compared with 40 cents for 2013/14. Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 515.2 million tons, up 2.4 percent from 2013/14 with increased soybean and peanut production partly offset by lower rapeseed, sunflowerseed, and cottonseed production.  Mostly due to a larger U.S. crop, global soybean production is projected at 299.8 million tons, up 5.6 percent.  The Brazil soybean crop is projected at a record 91 million tons, up 3.5 million on small gains in area and yield.  The Argentina soybean crop is projected at 54.0 million tons, unchanged from 2013/14 with lower area offset by higher yields.  China soybean production is projected at 12 million tons, down 0.2 million as producers continue to shift area to more profitable crops.  Global production of high oil-content seeds (rapeseed and sunflowerseed) is projected down 4.0 percent from 2013/14 on reduced rapeseed production in Canada and Ukraine, and reduced sunflowerseed production in Russia, Ukraine, and the European Union.  With crush projected to increase 2.4 percent, global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 94.8 million tons, up 14.6 million.  Global protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.2 percent in 2014/15.  Protein meal consumption is projected to increase 3.5 percent in China which accounts for 30 percent of global protein consumption gains.  Global soybean exports are projected at 112.3 million tons, up 1.5 percent from 2013/14.  China soybean imports are projected at 72 million tons, up 3 million from the 2013/14 projection.  Global vegetable oil consumption is projected to increase 4.1 percent in 2014/15 led by increases for China, India, and Indonesia.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2014/15 is down 5.6 percent from 2013/14, as lower beginning stocks and imports overwhelm a 0.2 percent rise in production.  Lower beet sugar production reflects reduced area and a return to trend yields, while higher cane sugar production is based on trend yields.  Imports under the tariff rate quota (TRQ) assume minimum U.S. commitments to import raw and refined sugar and projected shortfall.  The Secretary will establish the TRQ at a later date.  Total use is down 2.4 percent and ending stocks are 31.2 percent below a year earlier.For Mexico, 2014/15 supplies are down 4.5 percent from 2013/14, as lower beginning stocks are only partially offset by higher production.  Domestic use is flat, in keeping with recent trends, and ending stocks are unchanged, based on trends in population and reasonable carryover requirements.  Exports are projected lower, with shipments to the U.S. market down 23.0 percent from 2013/14.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. red meat and poultry production in 2015 is projected to be above 2014 as higher pork and poultry production more than offsets continued declines in beef production.  Pork production is expected to increase as producers respond to the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) by increasing farrowings and feeding hogs to heavier weights.  However, a slow recovery in growth in pigs per litter is expected to constrain increases in availability of market hogs in 2015.  Broiler and turkey production are forecast higher as lower forecast feed prices and record 2014 wholesale broiler and turkey prices encourage expansion.  However beef production is forecast lower as a declining beef cattle inventory and potential heifer retention during late 2014 and into 2015 is expected to limit cattle placements in late 2014 and into 2015.  Thus, despite expectations of heavier slaughter weights, tight supplies of fed cattle for slaughter and reduced cow slaughter will result in lower beef production.  Egg production for 2015 is forecast to expand as producers respond to lower feed costs and record 2014 egg prices.  For 2014, the total red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from last month on lower pork and broiler production.  Pork supplies reflect limited availability of hogs due to the impacts of PEDv on pigs per litter.  However, the decline in hog numbers may be partly offset by heavier carcass weights.  Broiler production is lowered on the pace of slaughter and a slow increase in egg sets and chicks placed.  Beef production is about unchanged from last month.  Turkey production is increased slightly based on the current pace of slaughter.  Egg production for 2014 is raised as higher table egg production more than offsets reduced hatching egg production.Lower U.S. beef production is expected to push beef exports lower and imports higher in 2015.  Pork exports are forecast higher in 2015 and imports are forecast lower as production increases.  Broiler and turkey exports are forecast higher on expanded supplies and continued strength in foreign demand.  The 2014 beef export forecast is lowered from last month on March export data.  Imports are forecast higher on strong processing-grade beef demand and tight supplies of domestic processing beef.  Pork exports are unchanged from last month as high March exports are expected to be followed by lower exports later in the year.  Broiler and turkey exports are adjusted to reflect March trade data.For 2015, fed cattle prices are forecast above 2014 as supplies continue to tighten and demand for beef remains strong.  Hog prices are forecast lower than 2014 as hog supplies increase.  However, broiler and turkey prices are forecast higher despite increased production as demand remains firm in the face of relatively tight red meat supplies.  Egg prices are forecast lower on increased production.  For 2014, the fed cattle price forecast is lowered from last month as prices for mid-2014 are reduced.  Hog prices are up from last month on tight supplies.  Broiler prices are higher as prices remain strong.  Turkey prices are unchanged.  Egg prices are forecast higher on strong to date prices.  Milk production for 2015 is forecast higher as lower feed costs and strong milk prices are expected to support both herd expansion and gains in milk per cow.  Fat-basis exports are forecast lower on increased competition from traditional exporters, primarily in butterfat markets.  Continued strength in nonfat dry milk (NDM) will help limit declines in skim-solids exports.  Fat-basis import forecasts are expected to be about the same as 2014 but skim-solids imports will be lower.  With higher domestic production, cheese, butter, NDM, and whey prices are forecast lower.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are forecast lower.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.70 to $20.70 per cwt for 2015.Milk production for 2014 is unchanged from last month.  Fat basis imports are forecast lower while skim-solids imports are higher.  Exports are raised on stronger sales of NDM, butterfat and cheese. Butter and whey prices are raised from last month while NDM is lower.  Cheese is unchanged but the range is narrowed.  The Class III price is raised on higher whey prices.  Class IV is up as higher prices for butter more than offset reduced prices for NDM.  The all milk price is forecast to average $22.70 to $23.00 per cwt.COTTON:  The first U.S. cotton projections for 2014/15 include larger production, lower offtake, and higher ending stocks compared with 2013/14.  Production is forecast at 14.5 million bales, based on the March Prospective Plantings report and the most recent 2-year regional average abandonment and yields.  The U.S. abandonment rate is projected at 24 percent due to persistent severe drought in the Southwest.  Domestic mill use is forecast at 3.7 million bales, 100,000 bales above 2013/14.  Exports are projected at 9.7 million bales, down 7 percent, due to lower anticipated world import demand.  Ending stocks are raised to 3.9 million bales or 29 percent of total use, which is about equal to the previous 10-year average.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers is 63.0 to 83.0 cents per pound, compared with 77.5 cents estimated for 2013/14.The initial 2014/15 world cotton projections show world ending stocks of nearly 102 million bales, which would be the fourth consecutive record.  World production is projected 1.4 percent lower than 2013/14 at 115.5 million bales, as reductions, mainly for China, Australia, and India, are partially offset by increases for the United States, Brazil, and Turkey.  World consumption is expected to rise more than 2 percent, due to projected growth in world GDP and expected reductions in China\u2019s price support levels. China\u2019s beginning stocks are expected to reach nearly 60 million bales, more than 60 percent of total world stocks.  China\u2019s imports are projected to fall about one-third in 2014/15, as the government is likely to restrict imports in favor of consumption of domestic cotton.  China accounts for virtually all of the anticipated 10-percent reduction in world trade.  With China\u2019s ending stocks expected to grow slightly, world stocks outside of China would rise about 7 percent.  For 2013/14, the final U.S. crop production estimate of 12.9 million bales is about unchanged from last month.  China\u2019s imports and India\u2019s exports are raised, but U.S. exports are reduced 300,000 bales due to the recent fall-off in sales.  U.S. ending stocks are raised to 2.8 million bales.  ",
    "January_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2012/13 is estimated at 92.7 million tons, up 1.4 million tons from last month.  Larger crops for soybeans, sunflowerseed, and peanuts are partly offset by reductions for canola and cottonseed.  Soybean production is estimated at 3.015 billion bushels, up 44 million bushels based on increased yields and harvested area.  The soybean yield is estimated at 39.6 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels from the previous estimate.  Soybean crush is raised 35 million bushels to 1.605 billion bushels reflecting higher projected domestic soybean meal consumption and increased soybean meal exports.  Soybean meal domestic consumption is raised in line with projected gains in meat production, especially for pork and poultry.  Soybean exports are unchanged at 1.345 billion bushels.  Soybean ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected at 135 million bushels, up 5 million from last month.  Soybean oil balance sheet changes include increased production, exports, and ending stocks. The projected range for the 2012/13 season-average soybean price is lowered 30 cents at the midpoint and narrowed to $13.50 to $15.00 per bushel.  The soybean oil price is forecast at 49 to 53 cents per pound, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at $430 to $460 per short ton, down 10 dollars on both ends of the range.Global oilseed production for 2012/13 is projected at a record 465.8 million tons, up 2.8 million due to increases for soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, and sunflowerseed.  Global soybean production is projected at 269.4 million tons, up 1.7 million with gains in the United States and Brazil only partly offset by a lower projection for Argentina.  The Brazil soybean crop is increased 1.5 million tons to a record 82.5 million reflecting record area and improving yield prospects.  Higher projected yields are the result of favorable moisture throughout the center west and southern growing areas.  The Argentina soybean crop is projected at 54 million tons, down 1 million mainly due to lower projected area resulting from excessive moisture throughout much of the central growing area.  Other changes include increased cottonseed production in China and Australia, and increased sunflowerseed production in India and the United States.Global oilseed trade for 2012/13 is projected at 115.3 million tons, up slightly from last month.  Increased soybean exports for Brazil are offset by a comparable reduction for Argentina.  Higher soybean meal exports mainly reflect increases for the United States and China.  Soybean meal consumption and imports are projected higher for several countries including Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Iran.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 66.6 million tons, down 0.3 million from last month as reduced soybean stocks in Argentina and China are only partly offset by higher stocks in Brazil and the United States.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2012/13 is increased 152,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, due to higher beginning stocks and production.  Sugar production in Louisiana is increased 150,000 tons based on processors\u2019 estimates.  Contributing factors to Louisiana\u2019s large sugar crop include ideal planting and growing weather for sugarcane, improved varieties, and lack of significant freezes during harvest.  Sugar use is unchanged.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2013 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is raised from last month, reflecting greater beef, pork, broiler, and turkey production.  Beef production is raised from last month based primarily on heavier carcass weights.  USDA will release its Cattle report on February 1, providing an indication of producer intentions for heifer retention in 2013 and feeder cattle availability.  USDA\u2019s December 28 Quarterly Hog and Pigs report estimated that the pig crop for the last half of 2012 was about the same as 2011, while indicating producers plan to farrow 1 percent fewer sows the first half of 2013 relative to 2012.  However, continued growth in pigs per litter in 2013 is expected to more than offset the decline in intended farrowings.  Coupled with slightly higher expected carcass weights, the 2013 pork production forecast is raised from last month.  Broiler production is raised as higher forecast broiler prices and lower forecast soybean meal prices are expected to enhance sector profitability.  Hatchery data are pointing toward higher-than-previously forecast production and bird weights have increased.  Turkey production is higher based on current hatchery data and expectations of lower soybean meal costs.  The egg production forecast is raised on hatchery data.  Estimates for 2012 beef and pork production are raised slightly based on late-year production data, but the estimates for poultry are unchanged.The forecast for beef exports in 2012 is raised based on recent trade data but is unchanged for 2013.  The import forecast is lowered for both 2012 and 2013 as global supplies of beef are expected to remain relatively tight.  Pork export forecasts for 2012 and 2013 are raised from last month based on expected greater availability of pork and continued firm demand.  Broiler export forecasts in 2012 and 2013 are unchanged from last month.  Turkey export forecasts for both 2012 and 2013 are higher this month.    Cattle prices for first-quarter 2013 are raised, reflecting current demand conditions for fed cattle.  Hog prices for 2013 are forecast lower based on larger expected hog supplies.  Broiler prices for 2013 are raised from last month on expected demand strength.  Turkey prices are lowered as production is forecast higher.  Egg prices are lowered from last month.  Prices for 2012 are adjusted to reflect reported December estimates.     The milk production forecast for 2012 is increased based on a slower decline in cow numbers and greater output per cow in the fourth quarter.  Milk production for 2013 is raised as the decline in cow numbers is dampened from last month.  Fat-basis imports for 2012 and 2013 are raised on higher butterfat and cheese imports, but skim-solids imports for 2012 are reduced on lower casein imports.  Fat-basis exports are unchanged for 2012, but the forecast for 2013 is raised on greater expected cheese and whey sales.  The estimate for 2012 skim-solids exports is reduced on lower nonfat dry milk (NDM) exports but the forecast for 2013 is raised. Butter and cheese prices for 2013 are lowered based on current price weakness and weaker expected demand.  NDM and whey prices for 2013 are forecast higher on current price strength.  The Class III price forecast is reduced as lower forecast cheese prices more than offset the higher whey price.  The Class IV price is lowered as the forecast decline in butter prices more than offsets higher NDM prices.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $18.85 to $19.65 per cwt.  Product and milk prices for 2012 are adjusted to reflect reported December estimates.COTTON:  The 2012/13 U.S. cotton estimates include lower production and higher offtake, resulting in lower ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is lowered 1 percent as a 500,000-bale reduction for Texas\u2014due to larger estimated abandonment\u2014is partially offset by increases in other states.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are increased 400,000 bales to 12.2 million, reflecting larger estimated import demand by China and supportive data on U.S. export sales to date.  Ending stocks are now forecast at 4.8 million bales, equal to 31 percent of total use.  The projected range for the average price received by producers of 66-71 cents per pound is raised 1 cent on the lower end.  This month\u2019s world 2012/13 estimates shows higher production and slightly lower consumption, resulting in ending stocks of 81.7 million bales.  Production is raised mainly in China, where recent levels of cotton classings and purchases for the national reserve indicate that the crop is larger than previously estimated.  Production is also raised in Australia but is lowered in the United States.  Global consumption is revised down slightly, mainly reflecting a reduction for India.  A 1.0-million-bale increase for China\u2019s imports is boosting world trade, and exports are raised for India, the United States, Brazil, and Australia.  China\u2019s imports are forecast higher due to strong imports to date and tight free stocks resulting from the large accumulation of cotton in the national reserve.  World stocks are increased 2.5 percent from last month.",
    "July_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 100.9 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month, with increased soybean production mostly offset by reductions for other oilseeds.  Soybean production is projected at 3.42 billion bushels, up 30 million due to increased harvested area.  Harvested area, estimated at 76.9 million acres in the June 28 Acreage report, is 0.7 million above the June projection.  The soybean yield is projected at 44.5 bushels per acre, unchanged from last month.  Soybean supplies are 30 million bushels above last month\u2019s forecast reflecting the production change.  With projections for exports and crush unchanged, 2013/14 soybean ending stocks are raised 30 million bushels to 295 million.  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2012/13 are unchanged.The 2013/14 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $9.75 to $11.75 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Product prices are also unchanged, with soybean meal prices forecast at $290 to $330 per short ton and soybean oil prices forecast at 47 to 51 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 492.9 million tons, up 2.1 million from last month.  Higher forecasts for soybeans, rapeseed, cottonseed, and peanuts are only partly offset by reductions for sunflowerseed.  Global soybean production is projected at 285.9 million tons, up 0.6 million with gains for the United States, China, and Canada only partly offset by reductions for Argentina and Russia.  Argentina soybean production is reduced due to a lower harvested area estimate for both 2012/13 and 2013/14.  Rapeseed production for Canada is projected at 15 million tons, up 0.5 million based on increased area consistent with the latest survey results reported by Statistics Canada.  Other changes include increased rapeseed production for China and Russia, reduced sunflowerseed production for Ukraine, and increased cottonseed production for India.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is decreased 647,000 short tons, raw value, from last month mainly due to lower imports.  Higher sugar production, based on higher area for harvest of both sugar crops, is partially offset by lower beginning stocks.  Reduced imports under the tariff rate quota and the re-export programs combine with lower imports from Mexico to reduce total imports by 694,000 tons.  Total use for 2013/14 is increased in line with the increase for the previous year.  Ending stocks are lowered 667,000 tons to 16.8 percent of use.  For Mexico, lower beginning stocks and higher use reduce ending stocks to 22 percent of domestic consumption.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2013 red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month on lower beef, pork and turkey production.  Beef production is lowered as steer and heifer slaughter in the second quarter was lower than expected.  The lower second-quarter slaughter more than offsets higher forecast slaughter in the second half of the year.  The pork production forecast is reduced, largely on a reduction in fourth-quarter slaughter.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that despite a record number of pigs per litter in March-May, the pig crop for that period was only fractionally above year-earlier.  Turkey production is lowered as hatchery data points toward sharper declines in second-half production.  The broiler production forecast is unchanged.  Egg production is raised on higher table and hatching egg production.  For 2014, the red meat and poultry production forecast is higher based on larger pork production.  Pork production increases are driven primarily by gains in pigs per liter as producers have indicated intentions to only gradually expand farrowings in the second half of 2013.    Beef and pork exports for 2013 and 2014 are unchanged.  The beef import forecast is lowered for 2013 and 2014 due largely to expected tight supplies in Oceania.  Pork imports are raised slightly for 2013 and 2014.  Broiler and turkey exports for 2013 are raised on the current strength of trade.  Forecasts for 2014 are unchanged.  The cattle price forecast for 2013 is lowered from last month as prices have weakened recently.  The 2014 price forecast is lowered for the first half of the year.  Hog prices are raised as demand strength carries from 2013 into 2014, but price gains will be limited by higher production.  Broiler prices are higher as strong demand is expected to support prices in 2014.  Turkey prices are down slightly for 2013 while 2014 is unchanged.  Egg prices are raised for 2013 on relatively strong demand.The 2013 milk production forecast is raised from last month based on growth in milk production to date.  The milk production forecast for 2014 is unchanged from last month.  Despite weaker forecast milk prices, forage supplies and feeding margins will likely continue to support modest gains in milk production. The fat-basis import forecast for 2013 is unchanged, but lowered on a skim-solid basis reflecting slower-than-expected imports of milk protein concentrates.  The 2013 fat-basis export forecast is higher on continued robust exports of cheese.  Skim-solid exports for 2013 are higher as nonfat dry milk (NDM) shipments are expected to remain strong.  The United States has gained in export markets typically served by the European Union which has experienced a slowdown in production.  Export forecasts for 2014 are unchanged. Fat and skim-solid basis ending stock forecasts for 2013 are raised as stocks of butter and cheese have remained large.  Ending stock forecasts for 2014 are raised as well.  Cheese and butter prices are forecast lower for 2013 on larger supplies.  Prices for 2014 are lowered as the larger carry-in stocks overhang the market.  The 2013 NDM price forecast is raised from last month on strong export demand, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  The whey price forecasts for both 2013 and 2014 are unchanged from last month.  The Class III price forecasts are lowered from last month in line with lower product prices.  The Class IV price forecast is unchanged for 2013 as lower butter prices are largely offset by higher NDM prices.  However, the Class IV price is lowered for 2014, reflecting lower butter prices.  The 2013 all milk price is forecast at $19.50 to $19.80 and the price for 2014 is $18.70 to $19.70 per cwt.COTTON:  The month\u2019s U.S. cotton estimates include slightly higher ending stocks in 2012/13 and 2013/14 resulting from a reduction in the current season export estimate, which reflects the recent pace of shipments.  Forecast production for 2013/14 remains at 13.5 million bales, the same as last month; however, estimates of planted area, harvested area, and average yield have been updated to reflect recent information.  The 2013/14 projections of domestic mill use and exports are unchanged from last month.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average price received by producers is lowered 3 cents on each end to 70 to 90 cents per pound.Projections of world cotton stocks are also raised in both 2012/13 and 2013/14 due to a combination of higher production and lower consumption.  For 2012/13, production is raised in Australia, while consumption is reduced in Pakistan and India, but is raised in Vietnam \u2013 these adjustments reflect recent data revisions.  For 2013/14, production is raised in India due to favorable early season weather conditions, while forecast consumption is lowered in Pakistan and Russia.  The balance sheet for China is unchanged this month and assumes continuation of current policies regulating the national reserve acquisition and release prices.",
    "June_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2013/14 are unchanged from last month.  Changes for 2012/13 include increased soybean imports and crush, and reduced exports.  Soybean imports are raised 5 million bushels to 25 million based on relatively strong imports through April and expected additional gains through the end of the marketing year.  Soybean exports for 2012/13 are reduced 20 million bushels to 1.33 billion bushels reflecting exceptionally low shipments and sales in May and competition from Brazil.  Although soybean exports are reduced, U.S. soybean meal exports are increased this month reflecting stronger-than-expected shipments this spring as importers have been slow to shift to South American supplies.  As a result of increased soybean meal exports, the U.S. soybean crush is projected at 1.66 billion bushels, up 25 million.  Soybean ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected at 125 million bushels, unchanged from last month.The 2013/14 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $9.75 to $11.75 per bushel, up 25 cents on both ends of the range.  The higher forecast reflects improved forward pricing opportunities and higher corn prices.  Soybean meal prices for 2013/14 are forecast at $290 to $330 per short ton, up 10 dollars on both ends.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 47 to 51 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 490.8 million tons, down 0.5 million from last month.  EU-27 rapeseed production is reduced 0.3 million tons to 19.7 million on lower area and yield, mainly for France.  Other changes include reduced soybean production for Ukraine, reduced sunflowerseed production for the EU-27, and increased sunflowerseed production for Russia.  Brazil\u2019s 2012/13 soybean production is reduced 1.5 million tons to 82 million reflecting the impact of dry conditions in the northeast.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is increased 435,000 short tons, raw value, from last month due to higher beginning stocks and imports from Mexico.  Imports from Mexico are increased based on Mexico\u2019s higher carryover from the large 2012/13 crop.  U.S. ending stocks for 2012/13 are up because higher imports from Mexico more than offset lower tariff rate quota imports.  Mexico\u2019s 2012/13 production is increased to reflect the strong pace of harvest to date.  For both countries, 2013/14 use is unchanged from last month and ending stocks are increased.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2013 is raised from last month as higher beef and broiler production more than offsets lower pork production.  Beef production is raised from last month as poor forage conditions have resulted in relatively large placements of cattle in feedlots in the first part of 2013 and cow slaughter remains high.  Broiler slaughter is raised slightly for the third quarter, reflecting hatchery data.  Pork production in second quarter is lowered based on the pace of hog slaughter and slightly lower expected carcass weights.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on June 28 and provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of the year.  Turkey production is unchanged from last month.  Egg production is raised, reflecting slightly higher table egg production in the third quarter.  Red meat, poultry, and egg production forecasts for 2014 are unchanged from last month.Forecasts for 2013 beef exports are reduced from last month as trade to a number of markets has been relatively weak.  Broiler exports are raised based on export strength to date.  Pork exports are unchanged.  Forecasts for 2014 are unchanged from last month. Cattle price forecasts for 2013 are lowered from last month, reflecting lower-than-expected prices to date.  Broiler prices are raised, reflecting strong domestic and export demand.  Hog prices are raised as tighter supplies have pushed prices higher.  Price forecasts for 2014 are unchanged.  The milk production forecast for 2013 is unchanged.  For 2014, the production forecast is lowered as relatively weak milk-to-feed ratios in the third and fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to slow production growth in the first half of 2014.  Fat basis exports for 2013 are lowered based on slow butter exports through April.  Skim-solid exports are higher based on expectations of continued robust nonfat dry milk (NDM) exports.  Fat and skim basis exports for 2014 are unchanged.  Fat basis imports are raised for 2013 and 2014.  Forecasts for 2013 cheese and butter prices are lowered from last month, reflecting greater stocks and weaker-than-expected prices to date.  The NDM price is raised on tightening supplies and expectations of continued robust export demand.  The price range for whey is narrowed.  As a result of the lower cheese price forecast, the Class III price is reduced.  The Class IV price is down as lower butter prices more than offset higher NDM.  For 2014, the butter price forecast is lowered as stocks remain high, but other product prices are unchanged.  The Class III price forecast is unchanged, but the Class IV price is lowered.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.60 to $20.00 per cwt for 2013 and $18.95 to $19.95 for 2014.COTTON:  The 2013/14 U.S. cotton supply and demand balance sheet shows lower beginning and ending stocks, lower production, and higher prices relative to last month.  The 2012/13 export estimate is raised 350,000 bales to 13.6 million, reducing the current season\u2019s ending stocks forecast.  This adjustment reflects continued strong sales and shipments and expected higher imports by China.  At the same time, projected U.S. production for 2013/14 is reduced to 13.5 million bales for 2013/14, as abandonment is raised to reflect continued drought conditions in the Southwest.  With the total 2013/14 supply 900,000 bales below last month, U.S. exports are reduced 500,000 bales to 11.0 million and ending stocks are reduced to 2.6 million, the equivalent of 18 percent of total use.  The projected range for the marketing-year average price of 73 to 93 cents per pound is raised 5 cents on each end, with a midpoint of 83 cents per pound, 15 percent above the estimated average for 2012/13.This month\u2019s changes to the world cotton estimates for both 2012/13 and 2013/14 result primarily from a sharp increase of 1.75 million bales in China\u2019s 2012/13 imports to a level of 20.0 million.  Higher imports by China in the current season are drawing stocks out of exporting countries and constraining the 2013/14 supply outside of China available for global consumption and trade.  World production in 2013/14 is reduced slightly from last month, based on lower production for the United States, Turkmenistan, and others; world consumption also is reduced slightly.  China\u2019s imports are reduced 1.0 million bales from last month to 11.0 million, accounting for most of the change in the world trade, as higher China imports in 2012/13 raise beginning stocks and domestic supplies.  Projected world 2013/14 ending stocks are reduced marginally, but China\u2019s stocks are raised 750,000 bales, leaving projected stocks outside of China about 3 percent lower.  These projections assume that China continues current policies regulating the national reserve acquisition and release prices.",
    "September_2022": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2022/23 include higher beginning stocks and lower production, crush, exports, and ending stocks.  Higher beginning stocks reflect a lower export forecast for 2021/22.  Soybean production is projected at 4.4 billion bushels, down 152 million with lower harvested area and yield.  Harvested area is down 0.6 million from the August forecast.  The soybean yield forecast of 50.5 bushels per acre is down 1.4 bushels from last month.  The crush forecast is reduced 20 million bushels and the soybean export forecast is reduced 70 million bushels on lower supplies.  Ending stocks are projected at 200 million bushels, down 45 million from last month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $14.35 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal and oil prices are also unchanged at $390 per short ton and 69.0 cents per pound, respectively.  Other changes this month include lower peanut and higher cottonseed production.Foreign 2022/23 oilseed production is increased 2.8 million tons to 516.3 million mainly on higher sunflowerseed and soybean production for Ukraine and higher rapeseed production for Australia.  Ukraine\u2019s sunflowerseed production is raised 1.0 million tons to 10.5 million due to favorable August rainfall.  Ukraine\u2019s soybean production is raised on higher area.  Rapeseed production for Australia is raised on recent beneficial rainfall improving yield prospects.  Higher exports of sunflowerseed and rapeseed from Ukraine and Australia are in line with higher EU imports.  EU soybean imports are lowered with higher supplies of other oilseeds.  China soybean imports for 2022/23 are lowered 1.0 million tons to 97 million.  Global soybean ending stocks at 98.9 million tons are down 2.5 million mainly on lower U.S. and China stocks.     SUGAR:  U.S. 2021/22 sugar stocks are reduced by 74,093 short tons, raw value (STRV) as combined lower production and imports are only partially offset by lower use.  Beet sugar production is lowered by 53,440 STRV on a small reduction in estimated sucrose recovery from crop year sliced sugarbeets and also less sugar (about 20,000 STRV) from desugared molasses.  Beet sugar production in August-September 2022 is still estimated at 500,000 STRV.  Cane sugar in Texas is reduced a small amount on revised processor reporting. Imports are reduced by 72,615 STRV.  Imports of 117,615 STRV under the 2021/22 raw sugar TRQ are now expected to enter after September 30 in fiscal year 2022/23 as permitted by the USDA extension of the quota year.  Although USDA extended the quota year time limit by two additional months from October 31 to December 31, there is no expected reduction in the raw sugar TRQ shortfall of 77,162 STRV.  Partially offsetting the TRQ import decrease is a 45,000-STRV increase in high-tier tariff imports, due mainly to high duty raw sugar imports made by refiners in August.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 50,000 STRV to 12,550,000 on lower-than-expected direct consumption imports in July and projected for August and September.For 2022/23, cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 40,000 STRV on the NASS increase in forecast sugarcane production.  Florida cane sugar production is decreased by 31,537 STRV based on processors\u2019 forecasts submitted to USDA.  Beet sugar production is decreased by 18,421 STRV on lower sugarbeet production forecast by NASS.  An increase in sugarbeet production in the Red River Valley is more than offset by reduced production in the Great Plains.  Imports of sugar from Mexico are decreased by 137,405 STRV to 1,618,775.  This projected reduction is made on the U.S. Needs calculation as provided in the CVD Suspension Agreement governing exports from Mexico to the United States of sugar for consumption.  There are no changes to use.  Ending stocks are projected at 1,710,386 STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.There are no changes from last month for Mexico sugar supply and use for either 2021/22 or 2022/23. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2022 red meat and poultry production is fractionally higher than last month, as higher beef, pork, and broiler forecasts are partly offset by a lower turkey forecast.  Beef production is raised for the second half of the year with higher expected slaughter for the period offset slightly by lower expected third-quarter carcass weights.  Pork production for the third quarter is raised on a higher-than-expected slaughter pace albeit at slightly lower carcass weights.  Broiler production is raised slightly on current slaughter data and higher eggs set and chicks placed.  Turkey production is forecast lower based on slaughter to date and hatchery data.  Egg production is raised slightly from last month.  For 2023, the red meat and poultry production forecast is raised on higher beef and broiler production.  The beef forecast was raised, reflecting higher expected placements in late 2022 which will be marketed in the first half of 2023.  Broiler production is raised on higher expected eggs set and chicks placed during the year.  Turkey production is lowered slightly, as first quarter production is expected to be close to 2022 levels.  The pace of egg production growth for 2022 is expected to carry into early 2023, supporting a higher forecast.The beef import forecast for 2022 is lowered on July trade data and expectations of slower imports, largely from Oceania during the remainder of the year; the export forecast is unchanged.  Beef import and export forecasts for 2023 are unchanged.  Pork imports and exports are both lowered for 2022 on recent data.  For 2023, pork imports are lowered but the export forecast is unchanged.  The broiler export forecast for 2022 is lowered on recent data and expectations of slowing demand in price sensitive markets; the forecast for 2023 is unchanged.  Turkey exports are unchanged for 2022 and 2023. Cattle price forecasts for 2022 are raised on current strength in demand, but forecasts for 2023 are unchanged.  The 2022 hog price forecast is lowered on observed prices but is unchanged for 2023.  The broiler price forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are lowered on higher forecast production.  Turkey price forecasts for 2022 are unchanged, while 2023 prices are raised as a result of the lowered early-year production forecasts.  The 2022 egg price forecast is raised as second half prices are expected to be supported by firm demand; as demand strength is expected to continue in early 2023, the first quarter price forecast is also raised. The milk production forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are lowered from last month.  Milk cow numbers are reduced, reflecting the average July 2022 cow number reported in the recent Milk Production report.  Slower growth in cow numbers is carried through late 2022 and is expected to carry into 2023.  Output-per-cow is forecast to increase at a slightly more rapid pace in 2022 but the forecast for 2023 is unchanged.Fat and skim-solids basis imports for 2022 and 2023 are raised, largely driven by recent trade data and higher expected imports of cheese throughout the forecast period.  Exports for both years are raised on expectations of stronger whey, lactose, and cheese exports, which are projected to be price competitive.For 2022, forecasts for butter prices and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are raised slightly on current price strength, but cheese and whey prices are unchanged.  Both Class III and Class IV prices are raised, reflecting changes in their component values.  For 2023, forecasts for butter and NDM are raised on tighter supplies, cheese is lowered slightly, while whey prices are unchanged.  The Class III price is unchanged while the Class IV price forecast is raised on higher butter prices.  The 2022 all milk price forecast is raised to $25.45 per cwt and the 2023 all milk price is raised to $22.70 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2022/23 U.S. cotton projections include higher beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks this month.  Beginning stocks are increased 250,000 bales, largely reflecting 2021/22 reported ending stocks data from the Agricultural Marketing Service and the NASS Cotton System Consumption and Stocks report.  Production is 1.3 million bales higher at 13.8 million, with higher production expected in most major producing states.  Exports are projected 600,000 bales higher this month as the U.S. share of exportable supplies rises, and ending stocks are 900,000 bales higher at 2.7 million bales.  The season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 96 cents per pound, 1 cent lower than in August.The 2022/23 world cotton projections include higher production and ending stocks relative to last month, and lower consumption.  World production is projected 1.4 million bales higher as more production in the United States, Australia, China, and Turkey offset decreases for Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Togo.  World consumption is 460,000 bales lower, with reductions in Pakistan and Vietnam.  World trade is unchanged as higher U.S., Australia, and Mexico exports offset lower expected shipments from Brazil and Uzbekistan.  On the import side, a 200,000-bale increase in Pakistan\u2019s expected imports offsets reduced expectations for Turkey and Vietnam.  World ending stocks are 2.0 million bales higher this month, at 84.8 million bales.",
    "November_2013": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at 96.4 million tons, up 3.3 million from the September estimate due to increased soybean, peanut, cottonseed, and canola production.  Soybean production is forecast at 3.258 billion bushels, up 109 million as higher yields more than offset lower harvested area.  Harvested area is reduced 0.7 million acres to 75.7 million.  The soybean yield is projected at 43.0 bushels per acre, up 1.8 bushels.  Soybean supplies for 2013/14 are projected 4 percent above the September estimate on both increased production and beginning stocks.U.S. soybean exports for 2013/14 are raised 80 million bushels to 1.45 billion reflecting increased supplies and the record pace of sales through late October.  Soybean crush is raised 30 million bushels to 1.685 billion mostly due to increased soybean meal exports.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 170 million bushels, up 20 million from the September forecast.The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2013/14 is projected at $11.15 to $13.15 per bushel, down $0.35 on both ends of the range.  The soybean meal price is projected at $375 to $415 per short ton, up $15 on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price range is projected at 40 to 44 cents per pound, down 3 cents on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2013/14 is projected at a record 499.4 million tons, up 4.3 million from September.  Higher soybean, sunflowerseed, and rapeseed forecasts account for most of the change.  Global soybean production is projected at 283.5 million tons, up 1.9 million as the increase for the United States more than offsets reductions for India, Canada, Russia, and Ukraine.  The India soybean crop is reduced 0.5 million tons to 11.8 million as excessive rainfall during much of the growing season reduced yield potential.  Global sunflowerseed production is increased 1 million tons to a record 42.8 million on gains for Russia, European Union, and Moldova which are only partly offset by a reduction for Argentina.  The increase for Russia reflects sharply higher yields reported in weekly harvest progress reports.  Global rapeseed production is raised to a record 67.9 million tons reflecting gains for Canada, Ukraine, and the European Union.  The increase for Canada is based on higher yields reported in the most recent survey from Statistics Canada.  Almost ideal weather conditions throughout the growing season resulted in a projected record large crop despite the first decline in harvested area since 2006.  Revisions to the world 2013/14 oilseed supply and demand estimates include reduced soybean exports and increased crush for Argentina and increased soybean exports for Brazil.  Soybean crush is reduced for India and Russia on smaller supplies.  Rapeseed exports are increased for Canada and Ukraine, while imports are raised for China.  Global oilseed stocks for 2013/14 are reduced 0.5 million tons to 80.7 million.  Soybeans account for most of the change, with reduced stocks in Brazil more than offsetting gains in Argentina and the United States.SUGAR:  Projected U.S. sugar supply for fiscal year 2013/14 is increased 115,000 short tons, raw value, from last month, as higher production more than offsets lower imports and beginning stocks.  Projected sugar production is increased based on higher forecast sugar crop yields.  Imports from Mexico are lowered slightly, as Mexico exports more to non-U.S. markets.  Ending stocks for 2012/13 are reduced to reflect lower final production estimates and higher sales by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to ethanol producers.  Sugar held by the CCC is included in ending stocks.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total red meat and poultry production for both 2013 and 2014 are lowered from September.  For 2013, the beef production is nearly unchanged as a lower third-quarter estimate is largely offset by higher expected fourth-quarter production.  Pork production is reduced from last month based on third-quarter data and a lower-than-expected pace of slaughter in October and early November.  The broiler production forecast is lowered as higher third quarter production is more than offset by lower expected fourth-quarter production.  Turkey production is reduced for both the third and fourth quarters.  Hatchery data points to a sharper-than-expected contraction in fourth-quarter production.  For 2014, the beef production forecast is reduced slightly from September on lower placements of cattle in feedlots during 2014.  The pork production forecast is reduced for 2014.  In the September Hogs and Pigs report, producers indicated intentions to expand sows farrowing through early 2014 and increases in farrowings during 2014 will likely be supported by moderating feed costs.  However, the 2014 pork production forecast has been tempered by continuing reports of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreaks.  Broiler production is raised as moderating feed costs support continued modest growth in broiler flocks.  The turkey production forecast is reduced as turkey prices in the third quarter were weaker-than-expected and the contraction in production forecast for late 2013 is expected to carry into early 2014.  The egg production forecast is raised for both 2013 and 2014 as hatchery data points to increasing egg-type laying flocks.  Beef imports are reduced for 2013 as based on the current pace of imports with the lower level carried through into 2014.  Despite lower U.S. beef production, which would increase demand for imports, global supplies are tight and demand by competing importers is expected to limit growth in U.S. imports.  Beef exports are higher for 2013 based on the strength of shipments to date, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged from September.  Pork exports are reduced from September based on the pace of exports and lowered for 2014 on slightly weaker demand in Asia.  The 2013 broiler export forecast is raised slightly, but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.  Turkey exports are raised for 2013 but the forecast for 2014 is unchanged.Cattle prices for 2013 and 2014 are raised from September as demand for fed cattle is strong.  Hog prices for both 2013 and 2014 are raised on tighter-than-expected supplies and firm demand.  The broiler and turkey price forecasts for 2013 are little changed from September and forecasts for 2014 are unchanged.  Egg prices are forecast higher for 2013, reflecting current prices; the forecast for 2014 is reduced on higher forecast production.The 2013 milk production forecast is reduced from September, reflecting slower growth in third-quarter production.  The production forecast for 2014 is raised as producers are expected to increase cow herds in response to improving returns.  Growth in milk per cow is also expected to be higher than 2013 as moderating feed costs and improved forage availability supports feeding higher quality rations.  Import forecasts are reduced for both 2013 and 2014 on lower expected milk protein concentrate imports.  Exports are raised for both 2013 and 2014 on stronger sales of fat containing products and nonfat/skim milk powders.  Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are forecast higher on strong domestic and international demand.  However, the price of whey is forecast lower, reflecting current prices.  For 2014 higher dairy production is expected to pressure cheese, butter, and whey prices but expected strength in exports supports a higher NDM price forecast.  Pressured by lower whey prices, the Class III milk price is reduced for 2013 and the forecast is reduced for 2014 on reduced price forecast for both whey and cheese.  The Class IV price forecast is raised for both years, largely on higher NDM prices although higher butter prices in 2013 also provide support for the higher forecast.  The all milk price is forecast at $19.80 to $19.90 per cwt for 2013 and $19.30 to $20.20 per cwt for 2014.COTTON:  This month\u2019s U.S. cotton forecasts for 2013/14 show higher production, offtake, and ending stocks compared with the September report.  Production is raised nearly 2 percent to 13.1 million bales, due mainly to increases for the Delta and Southeast.  Domestic mill use is raised 100,000 bales to 3.6 million based on strong early season activity.  Exports are unchanged at 10.4 million bales.  Accordingly, ending stocks are increased to 3.0 million, the equivalent of 21 percent of total use.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is forecast to range from 69-79 cents per pound, with the midpoint of 74 cents estimated 3 cents below September.The 2013/14 global ending stocks forecast is raised 1 percent this month, as sharply higher beginning stocks are partially offset by lower production and marginally higher consumption.  Stocks are raised mainly in India, as revisions are made to production and loss beginning in 2006/07 to bring historical stocks to levels which cover reported demand (see www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/cotton.pdf for more details).  Production forecasts for 2013/14 are lowered for China and Zambia, but raised for the United States, Brazil, and Greece.  Consumption is raised for Vietnam and the United States, but is lowered for Egypt.  World stocks are now projected at 95.7 million bales and include 57.8 million bales held by China.  This month\u2019s forecasts for China\u2019s consumption and imports reflect the government of China\u2019s announced policies for the acquisition and release of government reserves, which are unchanged from September.   ",
    "September_2020": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2020/21 include lower beginning stocks, production, and ending stocks.  Lower beginning stocks reflect increases in exports and crush for 2019/20.  Soybean production is projected at 4.3 billion bushels, down 112 million on a lower yield forecast of 51.9 bushels per acre.  Yield is down 1.4 bushels per acre from the August forecast.  With soybean crush and exports unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 460 million bushels, down 150 million from last month.  Other changes this month include higher peanut and lower cottonseed production.Soybean and product prices are all projected higher for 2020/21.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $9.25 per bushel, up 90 cents from last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at $315 per short ton, up 25 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is 32.0 cents per pound, up 2 cents.The 2020/21 foreign oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and ending stocks.  Higher foreign production of soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, and rapeseed is partly offset by lower sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is raised for Brazil, Canada, and India, and lowered for Ukraine.  Brazil\u2019s 2020/21 soybean crop is raised 2 million tons to 133 million, mainly on increased area as producers face stronger prices and competitive exchange rates ahead of planting.  Brazil\u2019s production for 2013/14 to 2018/19 also reflects revisions by Brazil\u2019s National Supply Company (CONAB).  Soybean production forecasts for Canada and India are raised on recent government data and planting progress reports.  Ukraine\u2019s soybean production is lowered due to low rainfall throughout August.Global soybean exports are raised 0.9 million tons to 166.3 million, with higher exports for Brazil and lower exports for Ukraine based on available supplies.  Crush is reduced for Argentina in line with the prior year\u2019s reduction.  Global ending stocks are reduced 1.8 million tons to 93.6 million as lower U.S. stocks are partly offset by higher foreign stocks, particularly for Argentina and Brazil.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar production for 2020/21 is increased by 27,095 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 9.292 million.  Cane sugar production in Texas is increased by 60,984 STRV to 141,984 based on processor reporting.  Projected cane sugar production in Louisiana and Florida are unchanged from last month.  Beet sugar production is decreased 33,889 STRV to 5.165 million on a decrease in the NASS-forecast national sugarbeet yield.  The Secretary of Agriculture increased the 2019/20 raw sugar TRQ by 100,000 STRV in early September and extended the period that the TRQ raw sugar can enter through October 31.  Of this amount, it is estimated that 11,814 STRV will enter in September of 2019/20 and 66,139 STRV will enter in October of 2020/21.  The 2019/20 raw sugar TRQ shortfall is increased by 22,046 STRV to 83,046.  FTA sugar for 2019/20 is increased by 6,931 STRV but reduced by the same amount for 2020/21 because sugar allocated to Canada for the 2020 calendar year entered the United States earlier in 2019/20 than forecast last month.  On the basis of pace, high-tier tariff imports for 2019/20 are increased by 30,000 STRV but imports from Mexico are reduced by 12,766 STRV.  For 2020/21, imports from Mexico are projected at 888,150 STRV, a decrease of 190,625 from last month and high-tier tariff imports are unchanged at 50,000 STRV.Deliveries for human consumption for 2019/20 are increased by 100,000 STRV to 12,150 million as the pattern of deliveries to end users has stabilized.  Deliveries for 2020/21 correspondingly are increased by 25,000 STRV to 12,150 million.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are estimated at 1.745 million for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.2 percent.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 1.659 STRV for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Mexico sugar supply and use for 2019/20 has small changes for imports of sugar for consumption, a small decrease for exports, and increased deliveries for the IMMEX program.  These changes are made on the basis of the pace to date.  The net result is to increase ending stocks by 4,926 metric tons (MT).  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) deliveries for 2019/20 are reduced by 60,000 MT, dry weight, to 1.410 million on pace.  For 2019/20, raw sugar exports to the United States are estimated at 758,113 MT and refinada exports are estimated at 424,765 MT.  For 2020/21 total exports are increased to match the increase in beginning stocks.  Exports to the United States are reduced to 760,110 MT on calculated U.S. Needs as set out in the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements.  Exports to third-country destinations are residually increased to 742,053 MT.  Projected deliveries of HFCS are unchanged at 1.470 million MT, dry weight.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2020 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower pork and broiler production more than offsets higher beef and turkey production.  Beef production is raised from the previous month on higher second-half cattle slaughter. The pork production forecast is reduced on the current pace of slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  Broiler production is reduced on recent hatchery data while turkey production is raised slightly.  The 2020 egg production forecast is raised on increased lay rates.  For 2021, the total red meat and poultry forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower expected beef, pork, and broiler production.  Beef production is reduced from last month on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  Pork production is reduced on lighter expected carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is reduced on slower expected growth as the industry adjusts to higher feed costs.  The turkey production forecast is unchanged. The 2020 beef import forecast is raised on continued firm import demand for processing grade beef, while the beef export forecast is unchanged.  No change is made to the 2021 beef trade forecasts.  The 2020 and 2021 pork export forecasts are unchanged as continued demand strength from China offsets weaker demand in other key markets.  The 2020 and 2021 broiler, turkey, and egg export forecasts are unchanged from last month. The cattle price forecast for 2020 is unchanged from last month while the 2021 cattle price forecast is raised on lower production.  Hog price forecasts are raised for 2020 on recent price strength but are unchanged for 2021.  The 2020 broiler, turkey, and egg price forecasts are raised on recent price strength.  For 2021, broiler price forecasts are raised on lower forecast production while no changes are made to the turkey and egg price forecasts.The milk production forecast for 2020 is raised from last month on higher expected growth in milk per cow.  For 2020, the fat basis import forecast is lowered, primarily on recent trade data and the expectation of slower butterfat imports.  The fat basis export forecast is raised on stronger global import demand for cheese, butter, and whey products.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged from the previous month, while the export forecast is raised on expectations of robust exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM) and whey products.  Cheese, butter, and whey price forecasts are reduced from last month, but the forecast for NDM is unchanged.  The Class III price forecast is reduced on lower cheese and whey price forecasts, while the Class IV price forecast is reduced on the lower butter price forecast.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $17.75 per cwt. For 2021, the milk production forecast is raised on stronger anticipated growth in milk per cow.  The fat basis import forecast is reduced from the previous month primarily on lower expected imports of cheese and other dairy products, while the fat basis export forecast is raised on anticipated firm global demand for U.S. butter.  The skim-solids basis import forecast is raised slightly, but the export forecast is raised on continued strong international demand for skim milk powder and whey products.  Price forecasts for cheese, butter, and whey are lowered while the nonfat dry milk forecast is unchanged.  The Class III price forecast is reduced on lower cheese and whey price forecasts.  The Class IV price forecast is reduced on the lower butter price forecast.  The all milk price forecast is lowered to $17.00 per cwt for 2021.COTTON:  The 2020/21 U.S. cotton estimates include slightly higher beginning stocks relative to last month but lower production, mill use, exports, and ending stocks.  Production is lowered 1.0 million bales to 17.1 million, with a lower projection for every region.  Mill use is projected 200,000 bales lower this month, but compared with its revised 2019/20 level is still expected to rise 16 percent.  Exports and ending stocks are 400,000 bales lower, reflecting reduced U.S. supply and stronger foreign competition.  Ending stocks in 2020/21 are projected at 7.2 million bales, equivalent to 42 percent of use.  The season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 59 cents per pound, unchanged from the previous month.The 2020/21 world cotton projections include lower beginning stocks, production, consumption, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Beginning stocks are lowered in India, more than offsetting increases for China and Brazil.  Production is higher in China, India, and Australia, but lower in the United States, Pakistan, and Turkey.  Consumption is lower in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil.  World trade is slightly higher, with increases for Australia, Brazil, and India offsetting lower U.S. exports.  Imports are forecast higher for Pakistan and Turkey, but lower for Vietnam.  World ending stocks of cotton in 2020/21 are projected at 103.8 million bales, 1.1 million lower than in August, and 4.4 million higher than in 2019/20. ",
    "September_2021": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean supply and use changes for 2021/22 include higher beginning stocks, production, exports, ending stocks, and lower crush.  Higher beginning stocks reflect a lower crush forecast for 2020/21.  Soybean production is projected at 4.4 billion bushels, up 35 million with lower harvested area more than offset by a higher yield forecast of 50.6 bushels per acre.  Harvested area is down 0.3 million from the August forecast.  Soybean crush is reduced 25 million bushels reflecting a lower forecast for domestic soybean meal disappearance.  The soybean export forecast is raised 35 million bushels on increased supplies and lower prices.  Ending stocks are projected at 185 million bushels, up 30 million from last month.  Other changes this month include lower peanut and higher cottonseed production.Soybean and soybean meal prices for 2021/22 are reduced from the previous forecasts.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $12.90 per bushel, down 80 cents.  The soybean meal price is forecast at $360 per short ton, down 25 dollars.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 65 cents per pound.The 2021/22 foreign oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher beginning stocks and lower production, exports, and crush.  Foreign oilseed production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 499.8 million mainly on lower canola production for Canada and the EU.  Partly offsetting is higher canola output for Australia and higher peanut production for India.  Canada\u2019s canola crop is lowered 2.0 million tons to 14 million, reflecting recent government reports. Lower canola supplies for Canada leads to lower exports of the oilseed and products to the EU, China, and the United States.  Lower global rapeseed supply is offset by increased soybean beginning stocks, mainly driven by higher-than-expected 2020/21 imports for China.  Higher beginning stocks for China and higher U.S. ending stocks account for most of the global 2021/22 soybean ending stocks increase, which are raised 2.7 million tons to 98.9 million.  Another notable oilseed change includes higher soybean meal imports for India as the government allows shipments of soybean meal made from genetically modified soybeans through October 31.  SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2021/22 is increased by 123,841 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5,201,683.  NASS sugarbeet yield and area harvested forecasts in the September Crop Production report imply national sugarbeet production of 34.612 million tons, an increase of 2.7 percent relative to last month.  Assuming average recovery, shrink, and recovery from desugared molasses, 2021/22 crop year production is forecast at 5,112,075 STRV, up from 4,988,235 last month.  Adjustments made for expected August-September production in 2021 and 2022 plus sugar from imported sugarbeets from Canada yields the fiscal year 2021/22 production projection.  Cane sugar production in Florida is decreased by 10,000 STRV to 2,005,000 on processor reporting.  There are no changes to production in Louisiana as neither NASS nor the processors made any adjustments related to Hurricane Ida\u2019s impact as damage assessments are still underway. Monthly high-tier tariff sugar imports covering the period July 2020 through May 2021 have now been revised by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the changes are incorporated into USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data (SMD).  Implied sugar WASDE changes from last month are for an increase in 2019/20 sugar imports of 22,379 STRV to 4,165,219 and an increase of that same amount for deliveries for human consumption to 12,246,183 STRV.Monthly high-tier tariff sugar imports covering the period July 2020 through May 2021 have now been revised by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the changes are incorporated into USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data (SMD).  Implied sugar WASDE changes from last month are for an increase in 2019/20 sugar imports of 22,379 STRV to 4,165,219 and an increase of that same amount for deliveries for human consumption to 12,246,183 STRV.On August 24, 2021, the USDA increased the 2020/21 raw sugar TRQ by 90,100 metric tons, raw value (MTRV) and also extended the TRQ entry period through October 31, 2021.  With the increase, the overall 2020/21 raw sugar TRQ is 1,207,295 MTRV.  On August 26, 2021, USTR provided notice of country allocations of the raw sugar TRQ increase.  The USDA estimates that 245,160 MTRV of the total raw sugar TRQ will not enter in September but 177,160 MTRV of that amount will enter in October.  This implies a raw sugar TRQ shortfall of 68,000 MTRV or 74,957 STRV. On August 26, 2021, the Commerce Department at the request of USDA increased the Mexico 2020/21 Export Limit by 17,527 STRV of Additional U.S. Needs Sugar of a polarity of less than 99.5 degrees.  This sugar is meant to be entered on or before September 30.  The USDA increased re-export imports for 2020/21 by 70,000 STRV to 315,000 on the pace to date.  Total imports for 2020/21 are now estimated at 3,169,134 STRV, just down slightly from last month.  On September 13, 2021, the USDA is to announce in the Federal Register the 2021/22 raw sugar TRQ at 1,117,195 MTRV and the refined sugar TRQ at 222,000 MTRV. Imports for 2021/22 are projected at 3,211,813 STRV, an increase of 75,872 over last month.  Changes include an increase in sugar TRQ entries of 415,747 STRV as detailed above and in high-tier tariff imports of 25,000, now totaling 75,000.  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 364,875 STRV to 1,083,900.  The raw sugar shortfall for 2021/22 is unchanged at 99,208 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption for 2020/21 are increased by 75,000 STRV to 12,200,000 on the strong pace of Direct Consumption Imports (that is, imports by entities that do not report to SMD).  This estimate is carried over to the deliveries\u2019 projection for 2021/22.  Ending stocks for 2021/22 are projected at 1,665,593 STRV, which is marginally lower than last month, and the implied ending stocks-to-use ratio is at 13.5 percent.  LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2021 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month as lower expected steer and heifer slaughter and lighter carcass weights more than offset higher cow slaughter.  The pork production forecast is reduced on lower expected second-half hog slaughter.  The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery and slaughter data while the turkey production forecast is reduced.  The egg production forecast is raised slightly.  For 2022, the total red meat and poultry forecast is reduced from the previous month.  The beef production forecast is reduced from last month on lower expected fed cattle slaughter and lighter carcass weights.  Pork production is unchanged.  Broiler and turkey production forecasts are raised on higher expected prices and lower expected feed costs.  The 2022 egg production forecast is reduced.For 2021, the beef import forecast is raised reflecting recent trade data; the export forecast is also raised on strong global demand from key trading partners; no changes are made to the 2022 forecasts.  The pork export forecast for 2021 is reduced on recent trade data and expected slower demand growth from Asia; no change is made to the 2022 forecast.  Broiler export forecasts are reduced slightly for both 2021 and 2022.  The 2021 turkey export forecast is reduced slightly from last month.   Fed cattle prices are raised for 2021 on current price strength and firm demand.  The 2022 price forecast is also raised.  The 2021 hog price forecast is raised on lower expected production.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are raised for 2021 and 2022 on demand strength.Milk production forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are reduced from last month on smaller dairy cow numbers and lower milk per cow.  For 2021, the fat basis import forecast is unchanged from the previous month, while the fat basis export forecast is raised on strong sales of cheese and butter and milk fat.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2021 is unchanged from last month, but the export forecast is raised on firm global demand for skim milk powder (SMP), cheese, and whey.  For 2022, the fat basis imports are raised on strong demand for imported cheese, while the fat basis export forecast is raised as U.S. butter is expected to be remain competitive in international markets.  No change is made to the 2022 skim-solids basis import forecast; however, skim-solids basis exports are raised from last month on continued strong global demand for SMP and whey. For 2021 and 2022, butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts are raised on improving demand and lower production.  The whey price forecast is unchanged for both years.  The 2021 and 2022 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from last month on higher dairy product prices.  The 2021 all milk price is forecast higher at $18.15 per cwt.  The all milk price forecast for 2022 is $18.40 per cwt. COTTON:  Beginning stocks are slightly lower than last month in the 2021/22 U.S. cotton estimates, but a much larger increase in production means that both exports and ending stocks are higher than estimated in August.  U.S. cotton production is forecast at 18.5 million bales, up 1.2 million bales despite a 4 percent decline in harvested area, largely due to increased projected yields in Texas.  With both world trade and U.S. supplies higher this month, U.S. exports are 500,000 bales higher and ending stocks are 700,000 bales higher.  A higher season-average farm price for upland cotton is also expected, up 4 cents per pound from last month to 84 cents.World 2021/22 cotton ending stocks are 540,000 bales lower this month as a 1.4-million-bale world consumption increase spread over 2021/22 and the year before more than offsets a 750,000-bale increase in 2021/22 world production.  Consumption is projected higher in both years for Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, and several smaller countries.  Turkey\u2019s consumption was also increased 100,000 bales for 2021/22, and Vietnam\u2019s lowered by the same amount due to recent problems with COVID-19.  World 2021/22 production is higher this month as increases for the United States, Australia, and Argentina offset declines in India, Greece, and several countries in West Africa\u2019s Franc Zone.  World trade in 2021/22 is still projected down from the previous year\u2019s record 48.5 million bales, but is projected 500,000 bales higher than in August, at 46.8 million bales.",
    "July_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 115.1 million tons, up 1.0 million tons mainly on higher soybean production.  Soybean production is projected at 3,885 million bushels, up 35 million due to increased harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at 84.4 million acres in the Acreage report, is 0.7 million above the June forecast.  The soybean yield is projected at 46.0 bushels per acre, unchanged from last month.  Despite increased production, soybean supplies are reduced 40 million bushels on account of lower beginning stocks.  Soybean crush is projected at 1,840 million bushels, up 10 million reflecting increased domestic soybean meal disappearance in line with adjustments for 2014/15.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 425 million bushels, down 50 million.U.S. soybean crush for 2014/15 is raised 15 million bushels to 1,830 million on increased domestic soybean meal use.  Soybean exports are projected at 1,825 million bushels, up 15 million reflecting shipments and outstanding sales through early July.  Seed and residual use are each raised based on indications from the Acreage and Grain Stocks reports, respectively.  Soybean ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 255 million bushels, down 75 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2015/16 is projected at $8.50 to $10.00 per bushel, up 25 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $315 to $355 per short ton, up 10 dollars on both ends.  The soybean oil price projection is unchanged at 30.5 to 33.5 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 531.8 million tons, down fractionally from last month.  Global soybean production is projected at 318.9 million tons, up 1.3 million mostly due to higher production in the United States and Bolivia.  U.S. peanut production is raised 0.2 million tons on higher harvested area as reported in the Acreage report.  Rapeseed production is reduced for Canada with lower yields more than offsetting increased planted area reported by Statistics Canada.  Rapeseed and sunflowerseed production are also reduced for EU on lower yields resulting from dry weather and above average temperatures that persisted through early July.  Other changes include reduced rapeseed production for China and Russia, and reduced soybean production for Turkey.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 102.2 million tons, down 2.4 million mostly reflecting lower soybean stocks in the United States and reduced rapeseed stocks in Australia, Canada, and EU.  South America soybean stock changes are mostly offsetting.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar beginning stocks for 2015/16 are decreased by 77,955 short tons, raw value (STRV) due to changes made in the 2014/15 supply and use balances of less sugar imported from Mexico (100,000) but more specialty sugar imported (22,046) due to an increase in the  refined sugar tariff rate quota (TRQ) on June 15.  Changes made to 2014/15 beet sugar production and cane sugar production offset each other.  Total 2015/16 sugar production is projected at 8.765 million STRV, an increase of 45,000 over last month.  Cane sugar production is increased by 105,000 STRV to 3.785 million and beet sugar production is decreased by 60,000 to 4.980 million.  Both changes stem from changes in area harvested based on forecasts published in NASS\u2019s Acreage report of June 30.Imports are forecast at 3.364 million STRV, an increase of 148,698.  The Secretary of Agriculture established the raw and refined sugar TRQs last month on June 15.  As expected, the raw sugar TRQ was established at the World Trade Organization (WTO) minimum access level and there was no change from last month in the forecast shortfall of 99,208 STRV.  In addition to the refined sugar TRQ minimum access of 24,251, the Secretary announced additional refined sugar access of 121,254 STRV for specialty sugar.  Imports from Mexico are forecast at 1.549 million STRV, 27,444 STRV higher than last month.  Ending stocks are forecast at 1.648 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Mexico 2014/15 production is estimated 45,000 metric tons (MT) higher than last month at 5.985 million as the sugarcane harvest is nearly complete.  Total exports for 2014/15 are reduced by 135,583 MT based on pace-to-date.  Exports to the United States are estimated at 1.220 million MT (85,583 less) and exports to other countries are estimated at 150,000 MT (50,000 less).  For 2015/16, exports to the United States are forecast at 1.325 million MT, an increase based on the changes made in the July sugar WASDE for the United States as per the CVD Suspension Agreement.Mexico 2014/15 production is estimated 45,000 metric tons (MT) higher than last month at 5.985 million as the sugarcane harvest is nearly complete.  Total exports for 2014/15 are reduced by 135,583 MT based on pace-to-date.  Exports to the United States are estimated at 1.220 million MT (85,583 less) and exports to other countries are estimated at 150,000 MT (50,000 less).  For 2015/16, exports to the United States are forecast at 1.325 million MT, an increase based on the changes made in the July sugar WASDE for the United States as per the CVD Suspension Agreement.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecasts for total meat production for 2015 and 2016 are raised from last month.  Beef production for 2015 is lowered as fed cattle slaughter in the second quarter is reduced.  In addition, relatively good forage conditions and higher feed prices are expected to slow the pace of placements until later in 2015, reducing available supplies of fed cattle for slaughter in late 2015.  However, these large placements will lead to higher marketings and slaughter in 2016 and the beef production forecast is raised.  The pork production forecast for 2015 is raised.  Pig crop data in the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report supported a higher third-quarter 2015 slaughter forecast.  The 2016 forecast is raised slightly.  Broiler production for 2015 and 2016 is raised based on hatchery data and continued increases in bird weights.  Turkey production is reduced for 2015 based on hatchery data.  Egg production for 2015 is reduced slightly as lower table egg production more than offsets an expected increase in hatching egg production.Forecasts for beef imports for 2015 and 2016 are raised as demand for processing grade beef remains strong; the export forecast is reduced slightly on trade data to date.  Pork imports for 2015 and 2016 are reduced and the export forecasts are raised.  Broiler exports for 2015 are raised on improved demand and large supplies; no change is made to 2016.  Turkey exports are reduced for 2015 as supplies are tight; no change is made to 2016.   Cattle prices for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month on weaker demand and larger supplies of competing meats.  Hog prices are higher for 2015 and 2016 as both export and domestic demand has improved.  Broiler prices are slightly lower for 2015 on weaker June prices but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.  Turkey prices for 2015 and 2016 are raised on tighter supplies.  Egg prices for 2015 are raised on tight supplies and prices to date but the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.The milk production forecast for 2015 is raised on a slightly more rapid increase in cow numbers and milk per cow.  However, higher expected feed prices and weaker milk prices during late 2015 and 2016 are expected to temper the rate of growth in production and the 2016 production forecast is lowered.  Fat basis exports are reduced as competition in world markets is expected to be strong in both 2015 and 2016 and domestic butter demand is expected to absorb much of the available supply.  Skim-solids exports are raised from last month as weaker nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices allow the United States to remain competitive in export markets.  Fat basis and skim-solids imports are raised for both 2015 and 2016 on expectations of abundant global supplies of dairy products and continued strength in U.S. domestic demand for butter and cheese. Cheese and butter prices for 2015 are raised from last month on continued domestic demand strength, but NDM and whey prices are forecast lower as the supplies of those products are abundant and prices decline to maintain competitiveness in export markets.  For 2016, the cheese price is unchanged, but the butter price is raised on expectations of robust domestic demand.  NDM and whey prices are reduced as lower prices are expected to maintain export competitiveness. For 2015 and 2016 Class III prices are reduced on lower whey prices.  Class IV prices for both years are reduced on lower NDM prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.05 to $17.35 per cwt for 2015 and $17.00 to $18.00 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton projections for 2015/16 show marginally lower beginning and ending stocks. The production forecast of 14.5 million bales is unchanged from last month, as lower expected abandonment and slightly higher yields offset the reduced planted area indicated in the Acreage report.  Domestic mill use and exports are both revised slightly, based on changes made in the 2014/15 balance sheet, which reflect recent activity.  The 2015/16 projected ending stocks are 4.2 million bales, down 200,000 from last month and unchanged from the beginning level.  The projected range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 54 to 70 cents per pound is raised 4 cents on the lower end, with a midpoint of 62 cents.This month\u2019s world cotton supply and demand estimates indicate lower consumption and higher ending stocks for both 2014/15 and 2015/16 relative to last month.  China\u2019s consumption is reduced sharply in both years due to continued strong competition from both polyester and imported cotton products.  At the same time, 2015/16\u2019s projected growth in world cotton consumption remains above 3 percent, as this month\u2019s reductions in consumption by China, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are partially offset by increases for India and Vietnam.  World production is about unchanged, but world trade is raised, as lower imports by China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are more than offset by an increase for Vietnam.  Projected 2015/16 world ending stocks are raised by more than 2.0 million bales; however, with the expected China carryover 2.5 million bales above last month, stocks outside of China are projected lower.",
    "June_2015": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2015/16 include lower beginning stocks, slightly higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Lower beginning stocks reflect higher crush and export projections for 2014/15.  Soybean crush for 2014/15 is raised 10 million bushels to 1,815 million reflecting an increase in projected soybean meal domestic disappearance which is partly offset by reduced exports of soybean meal.  Higher soybean meal domestic disappearance reflects stronger-than-expected use for the marketing year to date.  Soybean exports are projected at 1,810 million bushels, up 10 million reflecting outstanding sales and shipments through May.  Soybean ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 330 million bushels, down 20 million from last month.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are reduced 25 million bushels to 475 million.The 2015/16 season-average price for soybeans is projected at $8.25 to $9.75 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal prices are also unchanged at $305 to $345 per short ton.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 30.5 to 33.5 cents per pound, up 1 cent at the midpoint.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 531.9 million tons, up 0.7 million from last month.  Soybean production for Russia is raised on higher area projections based on reported planting progress to date.  Rapeseed production for EU is raised 0.5 million tons to 22.1 million on improved yield prospects.  Other changes include increased soybean production for EU and reduced rapeseed production for Ukraine.  Argentina soybean production for 2014/15 is raised 1 million tons to 59.5 million mainly on increased harvested area.Global soybean supply and use changes include increased crush and lower stocks for both 2014/15 and 2015/16.  Brazil\u2019s soybean crush, meal production, and domestic disappearance for 2014/15 are raised based on recently released official data.  With the lower stocks in Brazil only partly offset by higher stocks in Argentina, global soybean stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 93.2 million tons, down 3.0 million from last month.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar beginning stocks for 2015/16 are increased by 200,523 short tons, raw value (STRV) due to changes made in the 2014/15 supply and use balances of greater early beet sugar production (33,480) from the 2015/16 sugarbeet crop, reduced tariff-rate quota shortfall (58,103), and reduced deliveries for human consumption (108,940).  U.S. beet sugar production for 2015/16 is forecast at 5.040 million STRV, an increase of 269,569 and based on analysis of early planting and favorable weather, and also consistent with beet processors\u2019 forecasts published in USDA\u2019s Sweetener Market Data.  There is no change to cane sugar production for 2015/16.  Imports for 2015/16 are forecast at 3.215 million STRV, a reduction of 595,053.  This reduction results from lower expected 2015/16 sugar exports from Mexico to the United States based on the implied Target Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs defined in the CVD Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014, assuming a 2015/16 specialty sugar quota equal to the quota for 2014/15.  All other 2015/16 import projections (including the tariff-rate quota shortfall) are unchanged. For 2015/16, U.S. deliveries for human consumption are lowered 110,098 STRV to 11.875 million.  The same year-over-year percentage increase from last month (1.06 percent) is applied to the updated 2014/15 deliveries estimate of 11.750 million to arrive at the updated projection for June.  Ending stocks are forecast as the difference between total supply and use.  The forecast is 1.533 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 12.6 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2015 is lower than last month, but higher for 2016.  Beef production for 2015 is lowered as fed cattle slaughter in the second quarter is reduced and cow and bull slaughter is expected lower during the year.  However, placements of cattle in late 2015 are expected to be higher as forage supplies in much of the country have improved and the slaughter of these cattle in 2016 supports an increase in the 2016 production forecast.  Pork production for 2015 is raised due to higher-than-expected second-quarter slaughter.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on June 26 and provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of 2015.  Broiler production for 2015 and 2016 is raised from last month based on hatchery data.  Turkey production is reduced for both 2015 and 2016 as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has significantly affected supplies of turkeys and the expected pace of flock recovery results in a reduced 2016 production forecast.  Egg production for 2015 and 2016 is also lowered as HPAI has impacted the laying flock, and the forecast into 2016 reflects the expected speed at which the flock can be rebuilt.Forecasts for 2015 and 2016 beef imports are raised as demand for processing grade beef remains strong; no change is made to the export forecast.  Pork imports for 2015 are reduced, but exports are higher based on the pace of trade to date.  No change is made to 2016 pork trade.  Broiler exports for 2015 are lowered as demand has been below expectations; no change is made to 2016.  Turkey exports are reduced for both 2015 and 2016 as supplies are tightened by HPAI.   Cattle prices for 2015 are reduced from last month on prices to date and the forecast for 2016 is reduced on expected larger supplies of fed cattle.  Hog prices are higher in 2015 but unchanged for 2016.  Broiler prices are unchanged as continued strong domestic demand is expected to absorb increased supplies of broiler meat.  Turkey and egg prices for 2015 and 2016 are raised from last month on tighter supplies.   Milk production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are raised from last month on gains in output per cow.  The fat basis export forecast for 2015 is raised on higher cheese exports.  Skim solids exports for both 2015 and 2016 are raised on larger exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM).  Fat basis imports are raised for both 2015 and 2016 on expectations of strong demand for imported cheese. Butter, NDM, and whey prices for 2015 are forecast lower on relatively abundant supplies of those products.  The cheese price forecast is raised on strong demand.  NDM and whey prices are reduced for 2016.  The 2016 butter price range is narrowed.  The Class III price forecast is raised for 2015 on stronger cheese prices but reduced for 2016 on lower whey prices.  Class IV prices for 2015 and 2016 are lowered on weaker product prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $17.15 to $17.55 per cwt for 2015 and $17.45 to $18.45 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The 2015/16 U.S. cotton supply and demand projections are unchanged from last month.  The 2014/15 U.S. balance sheet is also unchanged, except that the estimated marketing year average price received by producers is raised 0.5 cents to 60.5 cents per pound.The 2015/16 world cotton supply and demand projections reflect very slight revisions, mainly marginal decreases in beginning and ending stocks.  The lower stocks result from changes made in 2014/15, including a combination of lower production in India, which is based on arrivals at gins, and slightly higher India exports.  Reduced stocks in India are partially offset by higher estimated stocks in China, owing to a 300,000-bale increase in estimated imports to 8.0 million bales.  Minor historical revisions are made to the balance sheets for Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
    "November_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 128.7 million metric tons, up 2.5 million from last month on increased soybean and cottonseed production.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,361 million bushels, up 92 million on higher yields.  The soybean yield is projected at a record 52.5 bushels per acre, up 1.1 bushels mainly on production gains for Minnesota, North Dakota, and Kansas.  Despite increased supplies, soybean crush is reduced 20 million bushels to 1,930 million mostly due to reduced soybean meal export prospects.  Sales are lagging year-earlier levels to several markets including Mexico, Canada, Thailand, and the EU.  Domestic soybean meal consumption is reduced slightly, in line with changes in the 2015/16 balance sheet.  Soybean exports are projected at 2,050 million bushels, up 25 million with increased supplies.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 480 million bushels, up 85 million from the previous forecast. Soybean and product price forecasts for 2016/17 are raised this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range is projected at $8.45 to $9.95 per bushel, up 15 cents on both ends of the range reflecting reported early-season producer prices.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $305 to $345 per short ton, up $5.00 on both ends.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 32.5 to 35.5 cents per pound, up 2 cents on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 551.2 million tons, up 3.1 million from last month led by higher soybean production.  Global soybean production is projected at 336.1 million tons, up 2.9 million with larger crops in the United States, Russia, and Mexico.  Smaller global production increases in cottonseed, peanuts, and rapeseed are partly offset by a reduction in sunflowerseed.  Global cottonseed production is raised 0.3 million tons to 39.1 million with increased production in India partly offset by a reduction for Argentina.  Global rapeseed and peanut production are raised to 67.8 and 41.8 million tons, respectively, on increased production projected for China.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced 0.3 million tons to 43.7 million on lower forecasts for Bolivia and the EU.  Global oilseed trade for 2016/17 is projected at 159.7 million tons, up 0.5 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports from the United States, Russia, and Ukraine and increased rapeseed exports from the EU account for most of the increase.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 92.9 million tons, up 4.7 million from last month.  Soybean stocks account for most of the change with increases for the United States, China, and Argentina.SUGAR:  The projection of beet sugar production from the 2016 sugarbeet crop is decreased slightly as reductions of area harvested and recovery offset an increase in sugarbeet yield.  Fiscal year 2016/17 beet sugar production is further decreased by 94,649 short tons, raw value (STRV) because of earlier-than-forecast harvesting taking place in September, consequently increasing the 2015/16 beet sugar production total by that same amount.  Cane sugar production for 2016/17 is increased by 1,121 STRV as an increase in Florida is almost offset by a reduction in Louisiana.  Cane sugar production for 2015/16 decreased by 13,136 STRV based on the complete fiscal year Sweetener Market Data (SMD).Imports for 2015/16 are reduced by 23,330 STRV.  Imports from Mexico as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau accounted for 22,807 STRV of the decrease.  However, USDA assesses that imports from Mexico totaling 12,476 STRV did enter under the 2015/16 Mexico Export Limit but were recorded by Census in the first week of October.  Therefore, this amount is reflected as an addition to projected imports from Mexico for 2016/17.Deliveries for human consumption for 2015/16 are reduced by 45,296 STRV to 11.905 million.  Almost all of the decrease is attributable to revisions to beet sugar deliveries data previously submitted for the 11 months prior to September.  Deliveries for human consumption in 2016/17 are reduced by 50,000 STRV to 12.000 million in line with the downward adjustment for 2015/16.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 reported in SMD are 2.055 million STRV and ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.897 million STRV, implying ending stocks-to-use ratios of 17.0 percent for 2015/16 and 15.6 percent for 2016/17.The 2015/16 Mexico sugar supply and use balance is revised with final year data reported by CONADESUCA, except for exports to the United States that are set to equal U.S. reporting of sugar imports from Mexico.  Projected Mexico sweetener consumption for 2016/17 assumes high fructose corn syrup consumption at 1.482 million metric tons (MT), the same as 2015/16, and sugar deliveries for human consumption at 4.454 million.  Exports to the United States for 2016/17 are increased by 10,677 MT corresponding to the October entry of the 2015/16 Export Limit amount.  The ending stock total for 2016/17 is forecast at 1.238 million MT, an amount projected to meet sugar supply requirements of domestic consumption and exports to the U.S. market for the first three months of the following marketing year.  Exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 454,111 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The 2016 forecast of total red meat and poultry production is increased from last month as higher fourth quarter beef and pork production forecasts more than offset reductions in broiler and turkey production.  Beef production is increased on the pace of slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Pork production for 2016 is raised based on the current rate of slaughter.  Broiler production is lowered based on September slaughter data.  Turkey production is reduced based on the pace of slaughter.  For 2017, higher forecast beef production more than offsets lower pork and broiler production.  Turkey production is unchanged.  The increase in beef production reflects slaughter of cattle placed in late-2016 and early-2017 as well as slightly higher carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered on slower expected gains in carcass weights.  Broiler production for 2017 is lowered from last month on slower second-half growth.  Table egg production is slightly reduced for both 2016 and 2017.The beef import forecast in 2016 is lowered due to expected tightness in supplies from Oceania.  Beef exports are expected to decline modestly in 2016 based on recent trade data. Beef imports and exports are unchanged for 2017. U.S. pork imports for 2016 and 2017 were lowered as increases in domestic pork production and lower prices are expected to limit demand for imports.  Pork exports in 2016 are lowered from last month on recent trade data.  Exports are raised in 2017 on lower hog prices which are expected to make U.S. product more competitive.  Broiler exports are raised for 2016 and 2017 on strong demand in a number of countries.  Cattle prices are forecast lower for the remainder of 2016 and for 2017.  Large supplies of fed cattle are currently weighing on prices and are expected to carry into next year.  Hog prices are lowered for 2016 and early 2017 on supply pressure.  However late-2017 prices are expected to reflect demand from new slaughter facilities.  Broiler prices are lowered for 2016 and 2017 as supplies of broilers and competing meats pressure the markets.Milk production forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are lowered from last month as recent data indicated that the U.S. cow inventory increased less rapidly than previously expected.  However, output per cow is raised from last month.  The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2016 is lowered, reflecting recent trade data, but the 2017 fat and skim-solid basis forecasts are unchanged.  Fat basis exports are lowered for 2016 and 2017 on slower sales of cheese and whole milk powder.  On a skim-solids basis, exports for 2016 are forecast lower on weaker sales of milk protein concentrates and whey, but are unchanged for 2017.Cheese and whey price forecasts for 2016 are raised on current price strength.  The forecasts for butter and nonfat dry milk (NDM) are lowered as supplies remain large.  For 2017, large supplies of butter are expected to continue to pressure prices, but prices of cheese, whey and NDM are expected to strengthen.  The Class III price forecast is raised for both 2016 and 2017 on higher cheese and whey prices.  However, lower butter prices are expected to more than offset higher NDM prices and Class IV prices for both years are lowered from last month.  All milk prices are forecast higher at $16.00 to $16.10 per cwt for 2016 and $16.30 to $17.20 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2016/17 U.S. cotton estimates include slightly higher production and ending stocks, as a larger Texas crop is partially offset by decreases for the Southeast.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  U.S. ending stocks are now estimated at 4.5 million bales, equivalent to 29 percent of total disappearance.  The forecast range for the marketing year average price received by producers of 63.0 to 71.0 cents per pound is raised on both ends.  The midpoint of 67 cents per pound- 6 cents above the revised 2015/16 average price of 61.2 cents- reflects activity to date.The world 2016/17 cotton estimates show larger production and ending stocks, due mainly to a 500,000-bale increase for the India crop.  Forecast world consumption is virtually unchanged.  World trade is raised slightly on a higher India export forecast.  World stocks are now projected at 88.3 million bales.  ",
    "September_2019": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2019/20 is projected at 110.2 million tons, down 1.3 million from last month with lower soybean and cottonseed production partly offset by a higher peanut forecast.  Soybean production is projected at 3.6 billion bushels, down 47 million on a lower yield forecast of 47.9 bushels per acre.  Soybean supplies are reduced 2 percent on lower production and beginning stocks.  With soybean crush and exports unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 640 million bushels, down 115 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2019/20 is forecast at $8.50 per bushel, up 10 cents.  The soybean meal price is projected at $305 per short ton, up $5.00.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound.Changes for 2018/19 include higher U.S. soybean exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Exports are increased 45 million bushels based on official trade data through July and indications from August export inspections, which were record high for the month.  With crush raised 20 million bushels, ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 1.0 billion bushels, down 65 million.This month\u2019s 2019/20 global oilseed outlook includes lower production, increased trade, and reduced stocks relative to last month.  Global rapeseed production is at a 3-year low, mainly reflecting lower production for the EU on both area and yield.  Australia\u2019s production is also lowered this month due to dry weather conditions in New South Wales and Queensland.  Soybean production is down slightly this month as lower U.S. production is mostly offset by higher output for India, Canada, and China.  Major global oilseed export changes for 2019/20 include higher rapeseed and soybean exports for Canada.  For 2018/19, soybean exports for Brazil are lowered based on lower-than-expected shipments during the past few months.  However, higher-than-expected exports by Argentina and the United States, particularly to China, are offsetting.  Global soybean ending stocks for 2019/20 are lower as reduced stocks for Argentina and the United States are partly offset by higher stocks for Brazil, Iran, and India.SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.005 million short tons, raw value (STRV), down 174,315 on reductions in NASS sugarbeet yield forecasts in Crop Production.  The national sugarbeet yield is down 3.5 percent from August with reductions in all major producing regions.  Beet sugar production for 2018/19 is decreased by 51,144 STRV to 4.957 million on processors\u2019 preliminary final crop year reporting that lowered estimated crop year sucrose recovery from sliced beets and lowered production from desugared molasses. Raw sugar TRQ imports for the 2018/19 quota year eligible for entry until October 15 are forecast lower by 27,558 STRV, implying an increased shortfall estimate of 55,116 STRV.  The reduction is expected to lower TRQ imports entering before September 30 by 22,046 STRV and imports in October by 5,512 STRV.  Re-export imports for 2018/19 are estimated 20,000 STRV higher based on pace to date, largely offsetting the TRQ reduction.  For 2019/20, imports from Mexico are projected at 1.118 million STRV, an increase of 149,375.Deliveries for human consumption for 2018/19 are decreased by 25,000 STRV to 12.175 million based on a slower-than-expected pace.  Corresponding deliveries for 2019/20 are decreased in line by the same amount.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are estimated at 1.747 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 14.16 percent.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected at 1.666 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.50 percent.Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.200 million metric tons, actual weight (MT), a reduction of 48,000 based on reports of drought in several producing areas.  With no changes to imports, deliveries, or ending stocks, the change in exports for 2019/20 match the 48,000 MT decrease in production.  Exports to the United States are projected at 956,738 MT, equal to the expected level of U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations are projected residually at 537,091 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2019 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as reduced beef, pork, and turkey production forecasts more than offset higher broiler production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month primarily on slower expected pace of fed cattle slaughter and lighter carcass weights in the fourth quarter.  The pork production forecast is reduced on the current rate of slaughter in the third quarter and slightly lighter carcass weights.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on September 27 and provide information on producer farrowing intentions into early 2020. The turkey forecast is reduced on lower expected third- and fourth-quarter production.  The broiler production forecast is raised on recent production data and continued growth in average bird weights for the remainder of the year.  The 2019 egg production forecast is raised slightly on hatchery flock data. For 2020, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month on higher expected beef and broiler production.  Beef production is raised from last month as higher expected first-half 2020 marketings support higher fed cattle slaughter in 2020.  First-half carcass weights are also expected to support increased beef production.  The broiler production forecast is raised from the previous month on expectations of a higher proportion of heavy bird weights.  Pork, turkey, and egg production forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. Beef import and export forecasts for 2019 are reduced, reflecting recent trade data; however, no changes are made to the forecasts for 2020.  The 2019 and 2020 pork export forecasts are raised from the previous month on recent trade data and expectations of continued strong global demand for U.S. pork products.  The 2019 broiler export forecast is adjusted higher reflecting recent trade data, but no change is made to the 2020 export forecast.  No changes are made to the 2019 and 2020 turkey trade forecasts.         The cattle price forecast for 2019 is lowered on current prices and expectations of continued price weakness; the 2020 forecast is also reduced.  Hog price forecasts are reduced slightly for 2019 and first-half 2020.  The 2019 broiler price forecast is raised on recent price strength, but no change is made to 2020 price forecasts.  Turkey price forecasts are unchanged for both 2019 and 2020.  The 2019 and 2020 egg price forecasts are raised from last month on strong demand that is expected to carry into the next year.The milk production forecast for 2019 is raised as stronger growth in milk per cow more than offsets forecast lower cow numbers.  For 2020, the milk production forecast is reduced from the previous month on slower expected growth in dairy cow numbers; however this is partly offset by slightly higher forecast milk per cow. The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are lowered on recent trade data and expectations of slower butterfat imports.  Fat basis export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are reduced from last month on weaker expected global demand for U.S. butterfat products.  The 2019 skim-solids basis import forecast is raised from the previous month on higher-than-expected imports of milk protein concentrates and a number of other dairy products.  This strength is expected to carry over into 2020 and the 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is raised.  The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2019 is reduced from last month on weakness in a number of dairy products, but the 2020 skim-solids basis export forecast is raised primarily on expected strong global demand for lactose. For 2019 and 2020, cheese, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey prices are raised from the previous month, but the price forecast for butter is reduced.  The 2019 and 2020 the Class III price forecasts are raised from last month on higher cheese and whey prices.  The 2019 and 2020 Class IV price forecasts are lowered from the previous month as lower forecast butter prices more than offset higher NDM prices.  The 2019 all milk price is forecast raised to $18.35 per cwt, and the all milk price forecast for 2020 is raised to $18.85 per cwt.COTTON:  The 2019/20 U.S. cotton estimates include lower beginning stocks, production, exports, and consumption, while ending stocks are unchanged.  Beginning stocks are reduced 400,000 bales this month, reflecting 2018/19 reported ending stocks data from the Farm Service Agency and the NASS Cotton System Consumption and Stocks report.  Production is lowered 654,000 bales to 21.9 million, largely due to a decline for the Southwest, while consumption is lowered 100,000 bales reflecting recent activity. Exports are projected 700,000 bales lower due to reduced U.S. production and a lower projected U.S. share of world trade.  The 2019/20 season-average price for upland cotton is forecast at 58 cents per pound, down 2 cents from last month.In both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 U.S. cotton balance sheets, the estimate for unaccounted cotton is revised downwards and exports are revised upwards.  The unaccounted element of the U.S. cotton balance sheet has been growing in recent years, indicating an imbalance in the sum of the other components.  The estimates for production, consumption, and stocks have maintained their consistency over this time, but a growing difference has occurred between the sources available for estimating U.S. exports.  For 2017/18, exports are raised 432,000 bales, and unaccounted is reduced 332,000 bales.  For 2018/19, exports are raised 546,000 bales, and unaccounted is 546,000 bales lower than the result based on the methodology used in past years.  In each marketing year, revised exports are estimated as the average of the export levels reported by the Bureau of the Census and USDA\u2019s Export Sales Reporting System.  See the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s Cotton: World Markets and Trade for more details on the export change and the Economic Research Service\u2019s Cotton and Wool Outlook for a detailed explanation of the stocks calculation.The 2019/20 world estimates this month show higher beginning stocks, but lower production, consumption, and world trade.  Production is forecast 709,000 bales lower as reductions for the United States and Australia offset an increase for India.  Consumption is forecast 1.3 million bales lower than in August, with lower estimates for China, India, Brazil, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States offsetting an increase for Turkey.  World trade is lower as lower imports are forecast for China, Vietnam, and Thailand.  World ending stocks for 2019/20 are forecast 1.3 million bales higher this month, at 83.7 million bales, 2.9 million bales above the revised 2018/19 estimate.",
    "September_2018": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2018/19 is projected at 138.4 million tons, up 2.9 million from last month with higher soybean and cottonseed production forecasts partly offset by a lower peanut forecast.  Soybean production is projected at a record 4,693 million bushels, up 107 million on a record yield forecast of 52.8 bushels per acre.  Soybean supplies are raised with higher production only partly offset by lower beginning stocks.  With soybean crush up 10 million bushels and exports unchanged, ending stocks are projected at 845 million bushels, up 60 million from last month.The 2018/19 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $7.35 to $9.85 per bushel, down $0.30 at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are lowered $5.00 at the midpoint to $290 to $330 per short ton.  Soybean oil prices are unchanged at 28.0 to 32.0 cents per pound.Changes for 2017/18 include higher exports, higher crush, and lower ending stocks.  Exports are increased 20 million bushels to 2,130 million based on official trade data through July and indications from August export inspections.  With crush raised 15 million bushels, ending stocks are projected at 395 million bushels, down 35 million from last month.The 2018/19 global oilseed outlook includes higher production, reduced trade, and increased stocks compared to last month.  Higher production of soybeans and cottonseed more than offsets lower forecasts for peanuts, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed.  Soybean production is increased 2.2 million tons, with larger crops for the United States and China that are partly offset by lower projections for Canada, India, and Uruguay.      Global soybean exports for 2018/19 are reduced 1.1 million tons to 156.9 million, with lower shipments for Canada and Uruguay.  China\u2019s 2018/19 soybean imports are reduced 1 million tons to 94 million as slower growth in protein meal demand and lower crush in 2017/18 continues into the next marketing year.  Partly offsetting this change are higher imports for Egypt and Iran.  Other notable oilseed trade changes include lower palm oil imports for India in 2017/18, with export reductions for Malaysia and Indonesia.  Global 2018/19 soybean ending stocks are projected 2.3 million tons higher, with increased stocks for the United States and Argentina that are partly offset by reduced stocks for Brazil.SUGAR:  U.S. beet sugar production for 2018/19 is projected up 235,923 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 5.343 million.  The increase is based on sugarbeet area and yield forecasts made by NASS in Crop Production, on improved sugar extraction based on processor-reported field conditions heading into the harvest campaign, and on a lower projected beet pile shrink.  Based on NASS sugarcane yield and area harvested and processors\u2019 forecast area for seed, 2018/19 cane sugar production in Louisiana is increased by 4,021 STRV to 1.785 million.  Projected imports from Mexico are reduced to 842,150 STRV and projected high-tier tariff imports are increased to 45,000 STRV.  There are no changes to 2018/19 sugar use.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected at 1.687 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent. Mexico ending stocks estimated for 2017/18 are increased by 21,140 metric tons (MT) to 1.268 million.  The 2017/18 stocks estimate represents sufficient supplies to cover domestic consumption in 2018/19 before the start of the campaign and 264,000 MT of unsold sugar that is expected to be converted into export certificates by the Fideicomiso Maestro para la Exportaci\u00f3n de Excedentes de los Ingenios (FIMAE) and that will be required to be exported in 2018/19 before December 31.  For 2018/19, exports are decreased by 431,857 MT to 994,892.  This change reflects lower exports to the United States based on a forecast reduction in U.S. Needs as defined in the amended Suspension Agreements that are offset by increased exports to other destinations for sugar under FIMAE.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are projected residually at 1.461 million MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2018 is reduced from last month on decreases in commercial pork and turkey production. The annual beef production forecast is unchanged as increases in second-half cattle slaughter are offset by lighter expected carcass weights.  The 2018 pork production forecast is reduced on the current pace of slaughter and slightly lighter expected carcass weights in the third quarter. USDA will release the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report on September 27, providing an indication of producer farrowing intentions into early 2019.  The second-quarter broiler production estimate is raised slightly, reflecting revised hatchery data but no change is made to outlying forecasts.  Second-half turkey production is lowered on recent production data.  For 2019, beef, pork, broiler, and egg production forecasts are unchanged; only a small increase is made to turkey production. Beef import forecasts are unchanged for 2018 and 2019, while export forecasts are raised on expectations of continued strong demand to a number of key trading partners.  Pork imports for 2018 and 2019 are lowered from last month.  Pork export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised from the previous month as U.S. pork is expected to remain competitively priced in international markets.  Broiler, turkey, and egg export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged. The third-quarter fed steer price forecast is raised from last month on current price strength, but the fourth-quarter forecast is reduced as the pace of marketings is raised.  Hog price forecasts for 2018 are lowered on current prices and pressure from expected abundant meat supplies.  For 2019, the first-quarter hog price forecast is reduced slightly, but the annual price forecast range is unchanged.  Broiler prices are reduced from last month for 2018 and 2019 on strong competition with other meats.  The annual turkey price forecast is reduced for 2018 as slightly higher third-quarter turkey prices are more than offset by expected lower prices in the fourth quarter; the 2019 forecast is reduced.  The third-quarter egg price forecast for 2018 is reduced on recent prices, but no change is made to the outlying forecasts. The milk production forecast for 2018 is lowered from the previous month on slightly lower milk cow numbers and a slower rate of growth in milk per cow in the third quarter.  However, for 2019, the milk production forecast is raised from the previous month on slightly higher cow inventories.  For 2018 and 2019, fat basis export forecasts are reduced from the previous month on slowing shipments of whey products and a number of other dairy products, while fat basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised on higher purchases of imported butterfat products and cheese.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are lowered on weaker whey products sales to China.  Skim-solids basis import forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are raised on continued strong purchases of cheese and other miscellaneous dairy products.  CCC donations reflect the recent pre-solicitation notice for the Trade Mitigation Food Purchase and Distribution Program.Cheese, NDM, and whey prices are forecast higher for 2018 while butter prices are lowered from the previous month.  The 2018 Class III price forecast is raised on higher forecast cheese and whey prices.  The Class IV price is raised as higher forecast NDM prices more than offset lower butter prices.  For 2019, NDM and whey prices are raised while the butter price forecast is reduced from last month.  The 2019 cheese price forecast is unchanged.  The all-milk price is raised to $16.30 to $16.50 per cwt for 2018 and $16.75 to $17.75 per cwt for 2019.COTTON:  The 2018/19 U.S. cotton estimates include larger production, exports, and ending stocks relative to last month.  Production is raised 447,000 bales, with increases in the Southwest, Delta, and Southeast.  Beginning stocks are revised 100,000 bales lower based on indicated stocks as of July 31, 2018, while domestic mill use is reduced slightly in 2017/18 based on recent activity.  The 2018/19 export forecast is raised 200,000 bales.  Ending stocks are now projected higher at 4.7 million bales, or 25 percent of total use.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average farm price is unchanged at 70 to 80 cents per pound.Larger 2018/19 world cotton production mostly offsets lower beginning stocks, and world ending stocks are only slightly higher this month.  Beginning stocks are reduced for India and the United States due to revisions in 2017/18 estimates.  Production is raised for China, Brazil, and the United States but is lowered for Australia.  Global consumption is increased 300,000 bales due to higher expected use in India, and trade is unchanged.  World ending stocks are projected about 400,000 bales higher this month, at 77.5 million bales, equivalent to 61 percent of world consumption.  If realized, this stocks/use ratio would be its lowest in 8 years, but higher than in virtually every other year before 2010/11.",
    "November_2017": "OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 132.1 million tons, down 0.1 million from last month due to lower soybean and peanut production.  Soybean production is forecast at 4,425 million bushels, down 5 million due to a fractionally lower yield.  With use unchanged, soybean ending stocks are projected at 425 million bushels.Prices for soybeans and soybean meal are raised this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $9.30 per bushel, up 10 cents at the midpoint.  The soybean meal price is projected at $295 to $335 per short ton, up 5 dollars on both ends of the range.  The soybean oil price projection is unchanged at 32.5 to 36.5 cents per pound.The foreign oilseed supply and demand forecasts for 2017/18 include higher production, exports, and stocks compared to last month.  Foreign production is forecast at 446.7 million tons, up 2.0 million with higher soybean, peanut, cottonseed, and rapeseed partly offset by lower sunflowerseed.  Soybean production for Brazil is increased 1 million tons to 108 million on higher reported area for Parana and Rio Grande do Sul.  Peanut production is increased for India on higher yields for the state of Gujarat.  Sunflowerseed production is lower for Ukraine, Argentina, and South Africa.  Major foreign soybean trade changes for 2017/18 include higher exports for Brazil and Paraguay, with increased soybean imports for China.  Foreign soybean ending stocks for 2017/18 are up from last month, mostly reflecting increases for China, Argentina, and Brazil.SUGAR:  Changes in supply and use for 2016/17 in both the United States and Mexico are made on the basis of full fiscal year data published by USDA in Sweetener Market Data and by CONADESUCA in their September National Balance Report.  U.S. beet sugar production is estimated at 5.101 million short tons, raw value (STRV) after record production in the month of September.  U.S. deliveries for human consumption are reported at 12.130 million STRV, a reduction of 70,411 from last month\u2019s estimate, likely due to stronger-than-expected hurricane-related operational and shipping disruptions in the final months of 2016/17.  U.S. ending stocks are estimated at 1.834 million STRV, up 102,294 over last month for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 14.8 percent.  In Mexico, deliveries for human consumption are estimated at 4.515 million metric tons (MT).  Along with an increase of deliveries of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to 1.531 million MT, dry weight, per capita domestic sweetener consumption in Mexico is estimated at 48.5 kilograms, up from the previously estimated 47.8.  Mexico ending stocks are estimated at 1.002 million MT, a reduction of 43,749 from last month.For 2017/18 imports in Mexico are increased by 20,000 MT, in line with reported 2016/17 import estimates.  Deliveries for human consumption are increased by 48,555 MT to 4.582 million MT on the basis of unchanged per capita sweetener consumption and projected total HFCS consumption equal to the previous year estimate.  The combination of reduced supply and increased use implies sugar available for export to the U.S. market at 1.450 million MT, a reduction of 81,044 from last month.  This amount allows Mexico to maintain an ending stocks-to-consumption bound of 18.0 percent for anticipated use in 2018/19.For 2017/18, the increase in U.S. beginning stocks are more than offset by slightly lower beet sugar production, reduction in imports from Mexico, and fewer expected 2016/17 raw sugar tariff-rate quota imports entering after September 30.  Total supply is reduced by 44,741 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are reduced by 123,000 STRV to 12.400 million.  Ending stocks are projected up 78,259 STRV to 1.775 million for an implied stocks-to-use ratio of 14.1 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2017 total red meat and poultry production is lowered from last month as lower beef, pork, and turkey production more than offsets higher broiler production.  Beef production is reduced from the previous month on a slower expected marketing pace for fed cattle in the fourth quarter and lighter carcass weights.  The pork production forecast is reduced as lower expected fourth-quarter commercial hog slaughter more than offsets slightly heavier carcass weights.  The broiler production forecast is raised on third-quarter slaughter data, but no change is made to the fourth-quarter forecast.  The turkey forecast is reduced slightly on lower than expected third-quarter slaughter data; no change is made to the fourth quarter forecast. The 2017 egg production forecast is lowered from last month as lower table egg production more than offset higher hatching egg production. For 2018, the total red meat and poultry forecast is raised from the previous month as higher expected beef and pork production more than offsets lower turkey production.  Beef production is raised from last month as higher expected placements in the latter part of 2017 and first-half 2018 are expected to support higher marketings and fed cattle slaughter in 2018.  However, carcass weights are expected to be slightly lower.  Pork production is raised from last month on higher expected first-quarter slaughter and slightly heavier carcass weights; no changes are made to outlying quarters.  The 2018 broiler production forecast is unchanged from the previous month.  Turkey production forecasts are lowered on weakness in prices which will dampen expansion in 2018.  The 2018 egg production forecast is raised from last month.   The beef import forecast for 2017 is raised from the previous month, but no changes are made to the 2018 beef import forecasts.  Beef export forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are raised from the previous month on expected strong global demand for U.S. beef.  For 2017, the pork import forecast was reduced fractionally on recent third-quarter trade data, but no change is made to the outlying pork import forecasts.  The 2017 and 2018 pork export forecasts are lowered from the previous month on slower-than-expected export demand in the third quarter which will carry forward into 2018.  Both 2017 and 2018 broiler export forecasts are reduced from the previous month on an expected slower pace in global demand.  The annual turkey import forecast is reduced for 2017, while the export forecast is raised.  No changes are made to 2018 turkey trade forecasts.         Cattle prices are raised for 2017 and first-half 2018.  The hog price forecast is unchanged for 2017, but the first-quarter 2018 hog price forecast is reduced on larger slaughter hog availability.  However, the annual hog price forecast remains unchanged.  The 2017 and 2018 broiler price forecasts remain unchanged from the previous month.  Turkey price forecasts are lowered for both 2017 and 2018 reflecting current price weakness. The 2017 egg price forecast is raised on strong fourth-quarter demand.  The first-quarter 2018 egg price forecast is raised. The milk production forecast for 2017 and 2018 is lowered from the previous month on an expected slower pace of growth in milk per cow and slightly lower cow numbers.  For 2017, the fat basis import forecast is lowered on recent trade data and the expectation of slower cheese imports in the fourth quarter; the forecast is raised for 2018 on higher expected shipments of whole milk powder and butter.  The 2017 skim-solids basis import forecast is reduced on lower-than-expected imports of milk protein concentrates and a number of other dairy products.  This weakness is expected to carry over into 2018, supporting a lower import forecast.  Fat basis exports are reduced for both 2017 and 2018 on lower butter and cheese exports. Skim-solids basis export forecasts are also reduced for both 2017 and 2018 on lower expected shipments of skim milk powder and whey products.    For 2017, butter, nonfat dry milk (NDM), and whey prices are lowered from the previous month, but the price forecast for cheese is raised.  For 2018, all dairy product prices are lowered on large supplies and global competition.  The 2017 Class III price is unchanged from last month as the decline in whey is offset by the higher cheese price.  The Class IV price forecast is reduced from the previous month on lower forecast butter and NDM prices.  For 2018 both the Class III and Class IV prices are lowered due to lower forecast product prices.  The 2017 all milk price forecast is reduced to $17.65 to $17.75 per cwt and the 2018 price is lowered to $16.90 to $17.80 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s 2017/18 U.S. cotton estimates include higher production and ending stocks, as a smaller crop in the West is more than offset by gains in the Southwest and other regions.  While the U.S. production forecast is raised 1 percent, to 21.4 million bales, domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  U.S. ending stocks are now estimated 300,000 bales higher at 6.1 million bales and, at 34 percent, are forecast at their highest share of use since 2008/09.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is forecast at 63 cents per pound, 3 cents above the October estimate, reflecting prices to date.The 2017/18, world cotton forecasts include lower beginning stocks, higher consumption, and lower ending stocks.  World production is raised 596,000 bales, as larger expected crops in China and the United States offset a 200,000-bale decline in the forecast for Australia.  But world 2017/18 ending stocks are forecast 1.5 million bales lower this month\u2014a 1.6-percent decline\u2014as revised historical data results in a 900,000-bale decline in estimated beginning stocks.  Argentina\u2019s 740,000-bale decline in beginning stocks is accompanied by smaller declines in the estimates for Australia and Uzbekistan.  World 2017/18 consumption is forecast 1.2 million bales higher than last month, with increases of 300,000-550,000 bales in the forecasts for Uzbekistan, China, and Bangladesh.  World trade is forecast 180,000 bales lower as a 400,000-bale decline in expected exports by Uzbekistan is only partly offset by a 100,000-bale increase for Brazil and smaller increases elsewhere.This month, new government data resulted in upward revisions to consumption going back as much as 10 years in Argentina, Uzbekistan, and Bangladesh.  With these historical revisions, world consumption over the past 3 years was raised more than 400,000 bales each year, so a large portion of this month\u2019s increase in expected 2017/18 consumption reflects an upward shift in the historical data.  Historical estimates of world trade were also reduced over the past 4 years, largely due to lower estimated Uzbek exports.  Details are provided in the November 2017 issue of Cotton: World Markets and Trade https:/apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/cotton.pdf",
    "June_2014": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2014/15 include a small reduction in beginning and ending stocks.  Lower beginning stocks reflect a higher crush projection for 2013/14.  Soybean crush for 2013/14 is raised 5 million bushels to 1,700 million reflecting an increase in projected soybean meal exports.  Soybean meal exports are projected at 11.5 million short tons, up 0.4 million from last month reflecting stronger-than-expected shipments this spring.  Soybean ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 125 million bushels, down 5 million from last month.  Ending stocks for 2014/15 are also reduced 5 million bushels to 325 million.The 2014/15 season-average price for soybeans is projected at $9.75 to $11.75 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  Soybean meal and soybean oil prices are projected at $355 to $395 per short ton, and 37 to 41 cents per pound, respectively.  Product price projections are also unchanged from last month.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 516.0 million tons, up 0.8 million from last month.  Rapeseed production for the European Union is raised 0.5 million tons to 22.0 million on improved yield prospects, mainly for the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, and Romania.  Other changes include increased soybean production for the European Union and increased cottonseed production for the United States.  Cottonseed production is also raised for India for 2013/14.SUGAR:  The Mexico 2013/14 forecast for sugar production is lowered from last month by 250,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.10 million MT as output continues to lag well behind last year\u2019s pace.  Given lower supplies and sharply higher domestic prices, total exports are reduced by 121,000 MT to 2.278 million.  However, exports to the United States are raised based on the pace to date, and exports to the rest of the world are forecast lower.  Ending stocks fall by 129,000 MT to 818,000 MT, or 19.0 percent of consumption.  For 2014/15, beginning stocks and exports are forecast lower.  However, relatively higher prices in the U.S. sugar market provide the incentive for increased 2014/15 exports to the United States.Total 2013/14 U.S. supply is forecast to rise by 261,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) with a 10,000 STRV increase in sugar from sugarcane production in Texas and a 251,000 STRV increase in imports.  Imports under the re-export program are raised 100,000 STRV, based on industry estimates, and imports from Mexico are increased 151,000 STRV.  With total use unchanged, ending stocks are forecast to rise to 15.0 percent of use, compared with 12.9 percent in May.  Total 2014/15 U.S. supply is projected up 811,000 STRV, with increases in beginning stocks and imports more than offsetting reduced production.  Beginning stocks, at 1.857 million STRV, are up 261,000 STRV.  Total sugar production is lowered 140,000 STRV, due to lower sugarcane production in Florida and Louisiana based on processors\u2019 first projections for 2014/15.  Total imports are forecast 690,000 STRV above May due to increased shipments from Mexico.  With no changes in total use, ending stocks are forecast to rise to 15.8 percent of 2014/15 use from 9.1 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2014 is lowered from last month as lower beef and broiler production more than offsets increased pork and turkey production.  Beef production is lowered as the pace of steer and heifer slaughter in the second quarter is reduced.  However, carcass weights are forecast slightly higher as feed prices have moderated.  Pork production is forecast higher due to a combination of larger second-quarter slaughter and higher carcass weights for the year.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on June 27 and provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of the year.  Broiler production is lowered from last month as the pace of expansion remains slow.  Turkey production is raised on higher second-quarter production.  Egg production is raised as strong table egg prices are expected to support increased production.  For 2015, no change is made to red meat or turkey forecasts, but the forecast for broiler production is reduced for early 2015.Forecasts for 2014 beef imports are raised as demand for processing grade beef remains strong; no change is made to the export forecast.  Pork imports and exports are raised based on April trade data.  Broiler exports are reduced as production forecasts are lowered from last month.  The slower pace of exports is expected to carry into 2015.  Turkey exports are unchanged from last month.   Cattle, hog, and turkey price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged from last month.  Broiler prices are raised for 2014 as supplies are forecast smaller, but 2015 prices are unchanged from last month.  Egg prices for 2014 are raised from last month as demand remains strong; prices for 2015 are unchanged.    Milk production forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged from last month.  Export forecasts are raised on a fat basis for 2014 and 2015 with higher cheese exports.  However, growth in 2014 exports is constrained by weaker butter sales as higher domestic prices have made U.S. butter less competitive on world markets.  Skim-solids exports reflect strength in cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) exports.  Imports for 2014 and 2015 are raised on higher imports of food ingredients.  Cheese and butter prices for 2014 are forecast higher on strong demand for cheese and tight supplies of butter.  The NDM price is lowered, but the whey price forecast is unchanged.  Strength in butter prices is expected to carry into early 2015 resulting in an increase in the 2015 price, but the prices of cheese, NDM, and whey are unchanged from last month.  Class III and Class IV prices for 2014 and 2015 are raised on stronger butterfat values.  The all milk price is forecast at $22.90 to $23.30 per cwt for 2014 and $19.75 to $20.75 per cwt for 2015.COTTON:  The 2014/15 U.S. cotton projections show higher production and ending stocks compared to last month.  Projected abandonment in the Southwest has been reduced due to recent favorable rainfall, resulting in a production increase of 500,000 bales to 15.0 million.  Overall U.S. abandonment is now projected at 21 percent, below the preceding 2 years, but above the long-run average, due to current subsoil moisture deficits in the Southwest.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged from last month, resulting in ending stocks of 4.3 million bales.  The forecast stocks-to-use ratio of 32 percent would be the highest in 6 years.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is projected to range from 60 to 80 cents per pound, down 3 cents on both ends of the range.  At the midpoint of 70 cents, prices would fall 10 percent from 2013/14.This month\u2019s 2014/15 world projections include higher beginning and ending stocks, equivalent increases in production and consumption, and a decline in world trade.  Beginning stocks are raised due mainly to a higher China import forecast for 2013/14 and higher 2013/14 production for India.  For 2014/15, production is raised for the United States, while consumption is raised for India and Vietnam, but is lowered for Pakistan.  World trade is reduced, as imports are lower for China and Pakistan, but higher for Vietnam.  World stocks are raised nearly 1.1 million bales from last month.",
    "July_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 113.1 million tons, up 5.0 million tons with higher soybean production accounting for most of the change.  Soybean production is projected at a record 3,800 million bushels, up 165 million due to increased harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at 84.1 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is 3.6 million above the June forecast.  The soybean yield is projected at 45.2 bushels per acre, unchanged from last month.  Soybean supplies are 180 million bushels above last month\u2019s forecast due to higher beginning stocks and production.  Soybean crush is projected at 1,755 million bushels, up 40 million reflecting increased domestic soybean meal disappearance in line with adjustments for 2013/14 and higher U.S. soybean meal exports that offset lower projected exports for India.  Soybean exports for 2014/15 are raised 50 million bushels to 1,675 million reflecting record U.S. supplies and lower prices.  U.S. soybean ending stocks are projected at 415 million bushels, up 90 million.  If realized, projected stocks would be the highest since 2006/07.Prices for soybeans and products for 2014/15 are all reduced.  The U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $9.50 to $11.50 per bushel, down 25 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $350 to $390 per short ton, down 5 dollars on both ends.  The soybean oil price range is projected at 36 to 40 cents per pound, down 1 cent on both ends.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 521.9 million tons, up 5.8 million from last month with soybeans and rapeseed accounting for most of the change.  Global soybean production is projected at 304.8 million tons, up 4.8 million mostly due to higher production in the United States.  Higher soybean production is also projected for Russia and Ukraine, both reflecting higher harvested area.  Lower soybean production for India resulting from reduced harvested area partly offsets these gains.  Harvested area is reduced based on planting delays resulting from the slow development of the monsoon in the main soybean producing states.  Rapeseed production is raised for Canada based on higher planted area reported by Statistics Canada.  Rapeseed production is also raised for Australia on higher area and yield.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 99.7 million tons, up 3.6 million mostly reflecting a sharp increase in U.S. soybean stocks.U.S. soybean crush for 2013/14 is raised 25 million bushels to 1,725 million on both increased soybean meal exports and domestic soybean meal use.  Soybean exports for 2013/14 are projected at 1,620 million bushels, up 20 million reflecting record shipments through early July.  Seed use is raised and residual is reduced based on indications from the June 30 Acreage and Grain Stocks reports, respectively.  Soybean ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected at 140 million bushels, up 15 million.SUGAR:  The Mexico 2013/14 estimate for sugar production is reduced by 75,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.025 million, based on very close to end-of-harvest reporting from Mexican authorities.  The 2013/14 estimate of exports is increased by 80,000 MT based on industry reporting of increased exports to non-U.S. destinations.  No other changes were made, implying ending stocks at 663,000 MT, for a low stocks-to-consumption ratio of 15.4 percent.  The Mexico 2014/15 forecast of production is lowered to 6.140 million MT based on expected reduced harvested area, and average sugar yields.  Imports are forecast to increase 224,000 MT to cover domestic consumption in that period before the harvest begins in late November.  Because consumption and ending stocks forecasts are unchanged, exports are forecast 291,000 MT lower at 1.616 million.  The U.S. 2013/14 beet sugar production is lowered by 50,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 4.750 million, based on an expected slow start of 2014/15 harvesting in September.  Imports are increased by 89,000 STRV due to the reallocation of the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) by USTR.  Total deliveries are increased by 90,000 STRV based on pace.  These events imply lower ending stocks, estimated at 1.808 million STRV with stocks-to-use at 14.5 percent.  The U.S. 2014/15 sugar production is forecast 130,000 STRV lower due to revised cane sugar processors\u2019 forecasts.  Total production is forecast at 8.225 million STRV.  Imports from Mexico are reduced to 1.877 million STRV, down 234,000 STRV.  Deliveries for human consumption are increased by 50,000 STRV, based on modest growth from the previous year.  Ending stocks are forecast at 1.447 million STRV for a stocks-to-use ratio of 11.9 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2014 is raised from last month.  Beef production is raised on higher steer and heifer and cow slaughter and slightly higher carcass weights.  Pork production is lowered as USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated a slower-than-expected expansion in farrowings during the second quarter.  This implies lower than previously forecast hog slaughter later in the year, but strong hog prices and lower feed costs are expected to provide incentives to feed hogs to heavier weights.  No change was made to broiler production as the production expansion remains muted.  Turkey production is raised on higher second-quarter production. Egg production is raised on strong table egg prices and lower feed costs.  For 2015, beef and broiler production is forecast higher, but pork production is forecast lower.  Cattle slaughter is forecast higher in early 2015 based on 2014 placements.  Pork production is reduced as supplies of market hogs will remain relatively tight.  Broiler production is forecast higher as lower expected feed costs support a more rapid increase in production.Forecasts for 2014 and 2015 beef imports are raised as demand for processing grade beef remains strong.  Exports for 2014 are raised on recent data.  Pork imports for 2014 are reduced slightly.  Despite high prices, pork exports remain robust and forecasts for both 2014 and 2015 are raised.  Broiler and turkey exports are raised for 2014 based on May data, but forecasts for 2015 are unchanged from last month. Cattle and hog price forecasts for 2014 are raised from last month on the strength of demand.  Broiler price forecasts for both 2014 and 2015 are unchanged from last month.  The turkey price forecast for 2014 is raised based on June price data, but the egg price is reduced.  The hog price forecast is raised for 2015 on expectations of tighter supplies and continued strong demand.  Prices for cattle, broilers, turkey, and eggs are unchanged at the midpoint for 2015.   The milk production forecast for 2014 is lowered from last month as slower growth in output per cow more than offsets a more rapid expansion in cow numbers.  The forecast for 2015 is raised as higher milk prices and lower feed costs are expected to support more rapid growth in cow numbers and output per cow.  Export forecasts for 2014 are lowered on a fat basis but raised on a skim-solids basis.  High domestic butter prices are expected to limit export opportunities, but nonfat dry milk/skim milk powder (NDM/SMP) exports are expected to remain strong.  For 2015, no change is forecast to fat-basis exports, but strength in NDM/SMP sales will help support higher skim-solids exports.  Product prices are forecast higher for 2014 with strength in butter prices expected to carry into 2015.  Despite increased production, robust domestic demand and stronger NDM/SMP exports will support prices.  Class III and Class IV prices for 2014 are raised on stronger component product prices and the Class IV price forecast for 2015 is raised reflecting strength in butter prices.  The all milk price is forecast at $23.25 to $23.55 per cwt for 2014, and $19.75 to $20.75 per cwt for 2015.COTTON:  The 2014/15 U.S. cotton forecasts show sharply higher production and ending stocks relative to last month.  Expected production is raised 1.5 million bales to 16.5 million due to larger planted area indicated in the June 30 Acreage report and lower expected abandonment based on favorable precipitation and improved crop conditions.  Domestic mill use is raised 100,000 bales due to expanding domestic mill capacity, while exports are raised 500,000 bales due to the larger available supply.  Despite the higher disappearance, ending stocks are raised to 5.2 million bales which, if realized, would be the largest since 2008/09.  The forecast range for the marketing-year average price received by producers is 60 to 76 cents per pound, with a midpoint of 68 cents, a 5-year low.A combination of higher estimated beginning stocks, higher production, and lower consumption raise projected 2014/15 global ending stocks by 3.0 million bales this month.  World beginning stocks are raised nearly 1.6 million bales due mainly to higher estimated 2013/14 production for Brazil and lower consumption for China and Pakistan.  China\u2019s consumption is reduced 1.0 million bales for 2013/14 and 500,000 bales for 2014/15, as high domestic price levels and uncertainty about future policies have discouraged cotton use in textiles in favor of polyester.  However, China\u2019s consumption is expected to grow nearly 6 percent in 2014/15 as a result of the announced elimination of government price supports.  For 2014/15, world production is raised 500,000 bales, as the forecast increase for the United States is partially offset by lower production for India, Australia, and Brazil.  Aggregate world trade is about unchanged from last month, but exports are raised for the United States, Australia, and Brazil and reduced for several other exporting countries.  World stocks for 2014/15 are now projected at 105.7 million bales.",
    "July_2016": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 115.4 million tons, up 2.5 million tons mainly on higher soybean production.  Soybean production is projected at 3,880 million bushels, up 80 million due to increased harvested area.  Harvested area, forecast at a record 83.0 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is 1.6 million above the June forecast.  The soybean yield is projected at 46.7 bushels per acre, unchanged from last month.  Soybean supplies are raised 60 million bushels with lower beginning stocks partly offsetting production gains.  With increased supplies, soybean crush and exports are raised 10 and 20 million bushels respectively.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 290 million bushels, up 30 million from last month.Soybean exports for 2015/16 are projected at 1,795 million bushels, up 35 million reflecting shipments and outstanding sales through early July.  Residual use is reduced based on indications from the June 30 Grain Stocks report.  Soybean ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 350 million bushels, down 20 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price for 2016/17 is projected at $8.75 to $10.25 per bushel, unchanged from last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at $325 to $365 per short ton, up 5 dollars on both ends.  The soybean oil price is projected at 29.5 to 32.5 cents per pound, down 1 cent on both ends of the range.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 536.4 million tons, up 2.6 million from last month with U.S. soybean production accounting for most of the change.  Foreign oilseed production is projected at 421.1 million tons, up 0.1 million with higher rapeseed and sunflowerseed production mostly offset with lower forecasts for cottonseed and copra.  Rapeseed production is raised for Canada mainly on increased planted area reported by Statistics Canada.  Rapeseed production is reduced for the EU on lower harvested area and yields.  Lower yields reflect excessive June rainfall, mainly in France.  Other changes include increased soybean production for Canada and increased peanut production for the United States.  Cottonseed production is reduced for India and Pakistan with partly offsetting increases for the United States and Australia.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 76.1 million tons, up 1.0 million with higher soybean, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed stocks only partly offset with lower peanut stocks.  Global vegetable oil stocks are raised mainly reflecting historical revisions for Indonesia.SUGAR:  Sugar production for the fiscal year (FY) 2016/17 is increased 250,896 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 8.961 million resulting from increases made by NASS in the June 30 Acreage report.  Sugarbeet planted area is forecast at 1.166 million tons, up slightly from last year and 0.6 percent above Prospective Plantings.  Sugarbeet harvested area is projected at 1.149 million acres, an increase of 2.2 percent over the level used for projecting production in the June 2016 WASDE.  Projected 2016/17 beet sugar production for the August/July crop year is increased 115,000 STRV to 5.333 million.  With 11.5 percent of the crop expected to be harvested prior to the start of the fiscal year, production for FY 2016/17 is increased 101,774 STRV to 5.192 million.  NASS projects sugarcane harvested area at 918,200 acres, up 3.5 percent from last year.  That increase, along with sugar yield in Texas returning to historical levels, implies an increase in 2016/17 cane sugar production of 149,000 STRV to 3.769 million.

That increase, along with sugar yield in Texas returning to historical levels, implies an increase in 2016/17 cane sugar production of 149,000 STRV to 3.769 million. Imports for 2016/17 are reduced by 408,090 STRV to 3.068 million. Reduced imports from Mexico totaling 387,109 STRV account for most of the decrease.  Beginning stocks for 2016/17 are reduced by 53,308 STRV due to lowered beet sugar production for 2015/16 and fewer imports under tariff-rate quotas for raw sugar and certain free trade agreements for 2015/16.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.654 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 13.5 percent.Beginning stocks for 2016/17 in Mexico are reduced 165,107 metric tons (MT) due to less 2015/16 production than projected last month and increased sugar for domestic consumption.  Deliveries for consumption in 2016/17 are expected to increase in line with the 2015/16 increase by 100,508 MT.  Exports to the United States are projected to decrease 331,302 MT to 1.173 million, based on changes made in this month\u2019s July 2016 WASDE for the United States as per the Countervailing Duty (CVD) Suspension Agreement of December 19, 2014 (\u201cTarget Quantity of U.S. Sugar Needs\u201d).  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.275 million MT, up 65,687 as lower beginning stocks and increased domestic deliveries partially offset the reduction in exports.Beginning stocks for 2016/17 in Mexico are reduced 165,107 metric tons (MT) due to less 2015/16 production than projected last month and increased sugar for domestic consumption.

Ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected residually at 1.275 million MT, up 65,687 as lower beginning stocks and increased domestic deliveries partially offset the reduction in exports.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total red meat and poultry production for 2016 is raised from last month.  Beef production is forecast higher largely on the pace of slaughter in the second quarter, but also as feedlot marketings during the second half of the year are expected to remain relatively high.  Pork production for 2016 is also raised, based on second quarter slaughter and larger expected slaughter in the fourth quarter.  Broiler production for 2016 is raised on year-to-date production and hatchery data.  The turkey production forecast is raised on second quarter production data.  For 2017, pork production is reduced.  In the June 24 Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, producers indicated intentions to have fewer sows farrow in the second half of 2016 compared to 2015.  No change is made to the 2017 production forecasts for beef or poultry.  Table egg production is raised for both 2016 and 2017 on improved returns. Only small changes are made to the beef and pork trade forecasts for 2016 and no change is made to the 2017 forecast.  Both beef imports and exports are raised based on May trade data.  Pork imports are lowered, but exports are raised.  Broiler exports are raised slightly for 2016 and 2017, based on the recent reopening of South Korea to U.S. fresh and frozen poultry meat.  No change is made to turkey exports.Cattle price forecasts for second-half 2016 are unchanged from last month as is the 2017 forecast.  Hog prices are raised for both years on current prices and lower expected supplies of hogs in 2017.  Broiler prices are unchanged for both 2016 and 2017.  Turkey prices are raised for the second-half of 2016, but are unchanged for 2017.  Egg prices are raised for 2016 as demand has begun to recover; the forecast for 2017 is unchanged.The milk production forecast for 2016 is lowered from last month as the pace of cow herd expansion has slowed.  However, the production forecast for 2017 is raised as higher forecast milk prices and lower feed costs in late 2016 and early 2017 are expected to lead to higher 2017 cow numbers.  Fat basis exports are lowered for 2016 as slowing sales of butterfat products more than offset higher whole milk powder (WMP) exports.  The forecast for 2017 is unchanged.  On a skim-solids basis, the export forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised on higher WMP sales.  For 2016 and 2017, imports are unchanged on a fat basis, but are raised on a skim-solids basis.  Fat basis stocks are forecast higher as stocks of butter remain high, but on a skim-solids basis, stocks are reduced.Cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and whey prices for 2016 and 2017 are forecast higher as demand remains robust.  Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised for both 2016 and 2017 as the component product prices forecasts are raised.  The all milk prices are forecast higher at $15.55 to $15.85 per cwt for 2016 and $15.70 to $16.70 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  The U.S. 2016/17 cotton projections show higher production offset by higher exports, with beginning and ending stocks revised down from last month.  The 1.0-million-bale increase in the crop projection is attributable mainly to higher planted area as indicated in the June 30 Acreage report, combined with slightly more favorable assumptions about abandonment and yield based on current conditions.  Domestic mill use is unchanged, but exports are projected sharply higher due to the larger U.S. supply and an expectation of continued tight foreign stocks.  The projected range of 52 to 66 cents per pound for the marketing year average price received by producers is raised 5 cents on the lower end and reduced 1 cent on the upper end; the midpoint of 59 cents is raised 2 cents from last month.A combination of modestly lower production and significantly higher consumption is reducing this month\u2019s global cotton stock forecasts for both 2015/16 and 2016/17.  The world carryin for 2016/17 is decreased 1.8 million bales owing to a sharp increase of 1.5 million bales in estimated 2015/16 China consumption.  Recent strong demand for the government\u2019s reserve sales indicates that mills are consuming more cotton than previously estimated.  A parallel increase is made in projected China consumption for 2016/17.  World 2016/17 production is reduced about 600,000 bales, despite the higher expected U.S. crop, mainly on reduced area expectations for Pakistan and India.  Production is also raised for Australia, but is lowered for Greece and Uzbekistan.  Smaller foreign crops are raising imports and reducing exports, especially for Pakistan.  World 2016/17 ending stocks are now projected at 91.3 million bales, a reduction of 9.0 million from the beginning level.",
    "June_2016": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2016/17 include lower beginning stocks, higher exports, and lower ending stocks.  Lower beginning stocks in 2016/17 reflect higher crush and export projections for 2015/16.  Soybean crush for 2015/16 is raised 10 million bushels to 1,890 million reflecting an increase in projected soybean meal exports.  Soybean meal exports are raised in part on commitments through early June.  Soybean exports for 2015/16 are projected at 1,760 million bushels, up 20 million with reduced soybean production and exports for Brazil and Uruguay.  Soybean ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 370 million bushels, down 30 million from last month.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are reduced 45 million bushels to 260 million on lower beginning stocks and increased exports.  Exports are raised with reductions for Brazil and Ukraine.The 2016/17 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.75 to $10.25 per bushel, up 40 cents at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $320 to $360 per short ton, up $20 at the midpoint.  Soybean oil prices are unchanged at 30.5 to 33.5 cents per pound.Global oilseed production for 2016/17 is projected at 533.9 million tons, up fractionally from last month.  Sunflowerseed production is raised for Ukraine on higher planted area based on reported planting progress to date.  The increase for sunflowerseed is mostly offset with reduced soybean and cottonseed production for Ukraine and China, respectively.  Changes for 2015/16 include reduced soybean production for Brazil, Uruguay, and China.  The Brazil soybean crop is reduced 2.0 million tons to 97.0 million reflecting the latest crop production report from the Government of Brazil.  Hot, dry conditions in parts of the Center-West and northeast resulted in reduced yields.With a lower soybean production estimate, Brazil October-September year exports and stocks are reduced for both 2015/16 and 2016/17.  Higher projected U.S. exports in 2015/16 and 2016/17 partly offset the decline to Brazil trade and reduce U.S. ending stocks.  Other trade changes in 2015/16 include reduced exports for Uruguay and imports for Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  Ukraine 2016/17 soybean exports are also cut with a lower forecast crop.  With lower global soybean beginning stocks and production, and a negligible change to crush, global stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 66.3 million tons, down 1.9 million from last month.SUGAR:  U.S. sugar imports for 2015/16 are increased by 182,558 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month.  Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the increase of the raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) by 140,000 STRV on May 17, 2016, it is estimated that 122,558 of that amount will enter, implying an increase in the total raw sugar TRQ shortfall of 17,442 to 45,000.  Following the Department of Commerce\u2019s approval of USDA\u2019s request for an additional 60,000 STRV of raw sugar imports from Mexico based on an additional need for \u201cOther Sugar\u201d of polarity of less than 99.2 and consistent with the CVD Suspension Agreement, sugar imports from Mexico are increased by that amount.  U.S. sugar production is increased by 7,874 STRV based on end-of-season reporting in Florida and Texas.  Based on pace to date, exports for 2015/16 are reduced by 35,000 STRV to 65,000 and deliveries for re-export products are increased by 30,000 to 130,000.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are calculated residually at 1.939 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 15.85 percent. Total U.S. sugar supply for 2016/17 is increased by 192,176 STRV based on the increase in beginning stocks less a small reduction in expected refined sugar TRQ imports.  No change in imports from Mexico for 2016/17 is made at this time as the Department of Commerce will announce the first 2016/17 Export Limit in July.  Total U.S. sugar use for 2016/17 is decreased by 15,000 STRV as a 25,000 STRV decrease in exports is partially offset by a 10,000 STRV increase in deliveries for re-export products.Mexico sugar exports for 2015/16 are increased by 91,350 metric tons (MT) with exports to the United States increased by 51,350 and exports to third-country destinations increased by 40,000.  With no other changes made to the Mexico sugar balance either for 2015/16 or for 2016/17, the reported changes reduce expected ending stocks in both years by the same 91,350 MT.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total red meat and poultry production in 2016 and 2017 is lowered from last month, largely as higher feed prices dampen the rate of production growth.  Beef production for 2016 is reduced mostly on lower carcass weights, but the pace of second-quarter slaughter is slightly slower than previously expected.  Production in 2017 is reduced on slightly lower carcass weights as higher feed prices are expected to encourage cattle feeders to minimize the amount of time cattle are on feed.  Pork production for 2016 and 2017 is lowered as higher feed prices are expected to impact weights through early 2017.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released on June 24 and provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of 2016.  Broiler and turkey production for late-2016 and early-2017 is lowered as higher feed prices slow the expected rate of expansion.  Turkey production in the second quarter 2016 is reduced on the current pace of slaughter.  Egg production for 2016 is also reduced on expected weaker returns.Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 beef imports are unchanged from last month; the export forecast is reduced slightly on the pace of trade to date.  No change is made to pork imports or exports for 2016 or 2017.  Broiler and turkey export forecasts are unchanged as well.  Cattle prices for 2016 are raised from last month on prices to date, but the forecast for 2017 is unchanged.  Likewise, hog prices are higher in 2016 but unchanged for 2017.  Broiler prices are raised for both 2016 and 2017 as domestic demand has strengthened and the rate of production growth has slowed.  Turkey prices are raised for 2016, but unchanged for 2017.  Although the rate of production growth is slowed, the recovery in demand has been weaker than expected.  Egg prices are reduced from last month on continued weakness in demand.Milk production forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are raised from last month as recently reported cow numbers indicate the herd continues to expand.  No change is made to output per cow.  Fat and skim -solids basis export forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are lowered as international supplies of dairy products remain abundant and U.S. prices remain high relative to those of competitors.  Fat and skim-solids basis stocks are forecast higher as stocks of butter and cheese are expected to remain relatively high.  Fat basis imports are reduced for both 2016 and 2017 on expectations of slower imports of butterfat products, and to a lesser extent, cheese.Cheese and butter prices for 2016 are forecast higher based on recent price data and lower forecast imports, despite relatively large stocks.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is raised based on recent price strength.  The whey price forecast is unchanged at the midpoint.  Cheese prices are forecast lower for 2017 as relatively high stocks pressure the market, but the prices of butter, NDM, and whey are unchanged from last month.  Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised for 2016 on component product prices.  For 2017, the Class III price is lowered on lower cheese prices, but the Class IV price is unchanged.  The all milk price is forecast higher at $14.95 to $15.35 per cwt for 2016, but is unchanged at $15.25 to $16.25 per cwt for 2017.COTTON:  A marginal reduction of 50,000 bales in 2015/16 domestic mill use is the sole revision in this month\u2019s U.S. cotton supply and demand estimates.  U.S. ending stocks are now forecast at 4.1 million bales for 2015/16 and 4.8 million bales for 2016/17.  The forecasts for the marketing year average price received by producers are unchanged for both seasons.The world 2016/17 cotton projections include lower beginning and ending stocks, due mainly to reductions in expected production by China.  The China crop estimates are reduced 1.3 million bales for 2015/16 and 1.0 million bales for 2016/17, based on reports from Chinese sources indicating that 2015-crop production in eastern China was lower than previously estimated.  Projected 2016/17 production is also reduced for Egypt and the African Franc Zone, with Egypt\u2019s production pegged at its lowest level since the mid-1800\u2019s.  Slightly lower world consumption includes a reduction for India, partially offset by an increase for Turkey.  Projected global stocks of 94.7 million bales are 1.7 million bales below last month, reflecting a 2.0-million-bale decrease in China ending stocks.",
    "November_2015": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2015/16 is forecast at 117.7 million tons, up 2.5 million from the previous estimate on increased soybean production.  Soybean production is forecast at a record 3,981 million bushels, up 93.6 million on higher yields.  The soybean yield is forecast at 48.3 bushels per acre, up 1.1 bushels mainly on gains for Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota.  Soybean supplies are projected up 2 percent from the October forecast.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,890 million on higher meal exports.  Soybean exports are also raised with additional supplies.  Ending stocks are raised 40 million bushels to 465 million.  If realized, ending stocks would be the highest since 2006/07.Soybean oil balance sheet changes for 2015/16 include increased beginning stocks and production, reduced imports and domestic disappearance, and increased exports and ending stocks.  Higher beginning stocks reflect final soybean oil stocks for 2014/15 as reported in the November 2015 NASS Oilseed Crushings report.  Domestic disappearance for 2015/16 is reduced in line with lower domestic use estimated for 2014/15.  Soybean oil ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 2,295 million pounds, up 265 million from last month\u2019s forecast.Soybean and soybean meal prices for 2015/16 are reduced this month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range is projected at $8.15 to $9.65 per bushel, down 25 cents on both ends of the range.  Soybean meal prices are projected at $300 to $340 per short ton, down $10.00 on both ends.  Soybean oil prices are projected at and 27.5 to 30.5 cents per pound, unchanged from last month.Global oilseed production for 2015/16 is projected at 531.0 million tons, down slightly from last month.  Lower sunflowerseed, and cottonseed production account for most of the change with nearly offsetting increases projected for soybeans and rapeseed.  Global soybean production is projected at 321.0 million tons, up 0.5 million, with the larger U.S. crop only partly offset by reductions for India, South Africa, and Uruguay.  The India soybean crop is reduced 1.5 million tons to 9.5 million on lower projected yields.  Inconsistent rainfall during the growing season and late-season heat results in below-average yields for the third consecutive year.  Global rapeseed production is raised to 67.1 million tons.  Increased production projected for Canada is only partly offset by reductions for Australia, Pakistan, and Russia.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced 0.8 million tons to 39.7 million on lower forecasts for Argentina, Pakistan, and EU.  Other changes include reduced cottonseed production for several countries including Pakistan, China, and EU.Global oilseed trade for 2015/16 is projected at 147.0 million tons, up 2.6 million from last month.  With higher soybean imports projected for China, exports are raised for the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.  Canada rapeseed exports are also raised with increased China imports.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected at 94.1 million tons, down 2.2 million from last month.  Soybean stocks account for most of the change with reductions for Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, and Canada only partly offset by an increase for the United States.SUGAR:  U.S. 2015/16 total sugar supply is increased 119,127 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month to 13.975 million.  Beginning stocks are increased by 69,127 STRV.  Louisiana 2015/16 cane sugar production is increased 50,000 STRV, due to improved sugarcane yield as indicated in NASS\u2019s November 2015 Crop Production.  There are no changes to other sources of supply or to total use.  Ending stocks for 2015/16 are projected at 1.855 million STRV, implying an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 15.3 percent.  For 2014/15, complete-year Sweetener Market Data (SMD) indicates increased total production of 60,798 STRV; increased exports of 4,875; and increased deliveries of 12,219.  Imports for 2014/15 are increased 25,423 STRV, based on USDA and U.S. Census Bureau estimates.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are estimated at 1.767 million STRV, and the 2013/14 stock-to-use ratio is 14.4 percent.Mexico 2015/16 total sugar supply is increased 104,933 metric tons (MT) with a beginning stocks increase of 48,908 combined with an increase in production of 56,025.  These changes were made after a review and adoption of new sweetener supply projections made by Mexico\u2019s Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (Conadesuca).  Conadesuca estimates beginning stocks at 810,709 MT and projects production at 6.056 million MT based on mill surveys.  Conadesuca projects 2015/16 sweetener deliveries for human consumption at 5.885 million MT.  Sugar deliveries are projected at 4.388 million MT (20,221 less than their 2014/15 estimate of 4.408 million) and high fructose corn syrup deliveries are projected at 1.497 million MT, dry weight (up 53,231 over their 2014/15 estimate of 1.444 million).  These use projections are adopted, but export projections for 2015/16 are unchanged.  The 2015/16 ending stocks are projected at 981,975 MT, implying an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 22.4 percent.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The total meat production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are little changed from last month due to largely offsetting changes in red meat and poultry.  Beef production for 2015 and 2016 is lowered on slower expected marketings from feedlots into early 2016.  However, the slower pace of slaughter is partly offset by higher expected carcass weights. Pork production is lowered for 2015 on a slower expected pace of slaughter and slightly lighter carcass weights during the fourth quarter.  The forecast for 2016 is unchanged.  However, broiler production is forecast higher for both 2015 and 2016.  September production was higher than expected, and hatchery data points to higher production into early 2016.  Turkey production in September was also higher than expected, which boosted 2015 production, although no change was made to the forecast quarters.  Egg production for 2015 is adjusted based on lower September hatching egg production, but production forecasts into 2016 are unchanged.Beef imports for 2015 are reduced to reflect the pace of trade to date; the forecast for 2016 is unchanged.  Beef exports for 2015 are lowered as demand remains relatively weak; no change is made to 2016.  Pork import and export forecasts are unchanged, but small adjustments are made to third-quarter 2015 to reflect September trade data.  Broiler exports for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month as the pace of export recovery has been slower than expected.  Cattle and hog prices for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged from last month.  Broiler prices are lowered for both 2015 and 2016 as large broiler meat supplies are expected to continue to pressure markets.  Turkey prices are unchanged for 2015 on current price strength, but the forecast for 2016 is reduced slightly.  Egg prices are lowered into first-half 2016, reflecting recent price movements.The milk production forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are reduced from last month as the dairy herd is expected to decline more rapidly from its second-quarter peak and growth in milk per cow in 2015 remains slower than expected.  Imports are reduced on both a fat and skim-solids basis for both years as imports of milk protein concentrates and casein are expected to be lower.  Exports are reduced for 2015 on weaker butter, cheese and whey sales.  Largely uncompetitive prices are likely to limit growth in export sales of butter and to a lesser extent, cheese in 2016, and fat-based exports are reduced.Strong domestic demand for butter is expected to support relatively high butter prices during the remainder of 2015, but supplies are expected to be large, and the price forecast for 2016 is lowered.  Cheese prices are lowered for 2015 and 2016 as supplies remain large.  The nonfat dry milk (NDM) price is reduced for 2015 and 2016 as prices move closer to international levels.  Whey prices are unchanged from last month.  Class III prices are lowered for 2015 and 2016 reflecting the lower 2015 cheese price forecasts.  Class IV prices are raised for 2015 due to the stronger forecast butter price which more than offsets the lower NDM price.  However, the 2016 price is lowered as cheese and NDM forecasts are reduced. The all milk price is raised to $17.00 to $17.10 per cwt for 2015 and lowered to $15.95 to $16.85 per cwt for 2016.COTTON:  The 2015/16 U.S. cotton balance sheet shows marginally lower production relative to last month, with ending stocks unchanged.  Production is reduced 57,000 bales, as decreases for the Southeast and Delta are mostly offset by an increase for the Southwest.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged.  The forecast range of 55 to 63 cents per pound for the marketing year average price received by producers is narrowed 1 cent on both ends, with the mid-point unchanged from last month at 59 cents. This month\u2019s 2015/16 world supply and demand estimates include lower production, consumption, and ending stocks.  Forecast production is reduced for India, Pakistan, China, Greece, Mali, and Mexico, based on current indications of northern hemisphere harvest results.  With consumption reduced mainly for China and Pakistan, total world consumption is now projected to grow a modest 1.1 percent this season.  World ending stocks are projected at 106.1 million bales, nearly 6 million bales below the beginning level.",
    "November_2014": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at 117.2 million tons, up 0.9 million from last month on increased soybean, peanut, and cottonseed production.  Soybean production is forecast at 3,958 million bushels, up 31 million on higher yields.  The soybean yield is projected at a record 47.5 bushels per acre, up 0.4 bushels mainly on gains for Iowa and South Dakota.  Soybean supplies for 2014/15 are projected 1 percent above the October forecast.U.S. soybean exports for 2014/15 are raised 20 million bushels to 1,720 million reflecting the record pace of export sales through late October.  Soybean crush is raised 10 million bushels to 1,780 million mostly due to increased soybean meal exports.  Domestic soybean meal consumption is reduced slightly in line with changes in the 2013/14 balance sheet.  Soybean ending stocks are projected at 450 million bushels, unchanged from the previous forecast.Soybean and soybean product prices for 2014/15 are unchanged from last month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range is projected at $9.00 to $11.00 per bushel.  Soybean meal and soybean oil prices are projected at $330 to $370 per short ton and 34 to 38 cents per pound, respectively.Global oilseed production for 2014/15 is projected at a record 528.9 million tons, up 0.5 million from last month.  Higher soybean and rapeseed production are only partly offset by a lower sunflowerseed forecast.  Global soybean production is projected at a record 312.1 million tons reflecting the increase for the United States.   Global rapeseed production is raised to 70.7 million tons on a record EU harvest.  Gains for EU are partly offset by a reduction for Australia where dry conditions in the southeast have reduced yield prospects.  Global sunflowerseed production is reduced 0.4 million tons to 39.8 million on lower forecasts for Russia and Kazakhstan which are partly offset by gains for EU and Serbia.  Other changes include reduced cottonseed production for China and Australia.Global oilseed trade for 2014/15 is projected at 134.6 million tons, up 0.6 million from last month.  Increased soybean exports from the United States and Ukraine and increased rapeseed exports from Canada account for most of the change.  Global oilseed crush is projected higher mainly on gains for soybeans in the United States, China, Ukraine, and South Korea.  Partly offsetting is a reduction in soybean crush for Argentina.  Rapeseed crush is raised for EU and China.  Global oilseed ending stocks are projected lower at 103.0 million tons on reduced rapeseed stocks in Canada and Australia.SUGAR:  U.S. 2014/15 total sugar supply is increased 40,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) from last month to 13.729 million.  Imports are increased by 135,000 STRV due to a reduction in the 2014/15 raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) shortfall projection by 101,000 and an expected increase of 34,000 from Mexico.  Partially offsetting the import increase are decreases in expected 2014/15 sugar production (down 80,000 to 8.462 million based on changes in processors\u2019 forecasts and National Agricultural Statistics Service sugar crop forecasts) and lower beginning stocks (down 14,000).  Deliveries for food consumption are increased by 109,000 STRV to 11.859 million.  With no other changes, 2014/15 ending stocks are projected 69,000 STRV lower at 1.485 million for a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.1 percent.  For 2013/14, complete-year Sweetener Market Data (SMD) implies increased total use of 59,000 STRV offsetting increases in total supply of 45,000 STRV.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are estimated at 1.796 million STRV and the 2013/14 stock-to-use is 14.3 percent.Mexico 2014/15 total sugar supply is decreased 37,000 metric tons (MT) with increased beginning stocks (146,000 MT) more than offset by lower expected imports for consumption (183,000 MT).  Deliveries for human consumption are decreased by 54,000 MT based on a continuation of reduced sweeteners consumption observed in 2013/14.  The ending stocks are forecast at 924,000 MT, 22.0 percent of consumption.  Exports for 2014/15 are calculated residually at 1.679 million MT.  The 29,000 MT increase in exports is forecast to go to the U.S. market for a new total of 1.354 million MT.  For 2013/14, adjustments are made based on complete-year Comit\u00e9 Nacional Para El Desarrollo Sustentable de la Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar (Conadesuca) data.  The largest change is a reduction of 52,000 MT in Mexico sugar consumption to 4.098 million MT.  All other Conadesuca revisions are minor.  An adjustment of -95,000 MT is included to account for the differences in trade reporting by U.S. and Mexican trade authorities.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production in 2014 is raised from last month, but the forecast for 2015 is lowered.  Beef production is higher in 2014 but lowered for 2015.  Cattle feeders are expected to raise animals to heavier weights in 2014 and 2015, but this is more than offset by a slower pace of marketings in the second half of 2015.  Pork production is forecast lower in both 2014 and 2015 as hog weights are expected to reflect a more rapid movement of animals through finishing barns.  Broiler production is raised for 2014 and 2015 as producers have expanded at a more rapid rate.  Turkey production for 2014 is raised, reflecting September slaughter data, but the forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Egg production is raised for 2014 based on September data and the forecast for 2015 is raised as favorable returns are expected to stimulate a more rapid expansion.The 2014 beef import forecast is raised on the pace to date.  The forecast for 2015 is unchanged from last month.  Beef exports for 2014 are updated to reflect September data; the 2015 forecast is unchanged.  Pork imports are raised for 2014, but are unchanged for 2015.  Pork exports for 2014 are lowered to reflect September data, but the forecast for 2015 is unchanged.  Broiler exports are raised for 2014 and 2015 on strength of demand. The turkey export forecast for 2014 is lowered based on September data.   Cattle price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are raised from last month on continued demand strength.  The hog price forecasts for 2014 are lowered on weaker demand, but 2015 prices are unchanged.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are unchanged.  Egg price forecasts for 2015 are reduced on higher production.  The milk production forecast for 2014 is increased from last month as growth in milk per cow has increased.  However, for 2015, the production forecast is lowered as the expansion in cow numbers and growth in milk per cow are expected to be more moderate.  Export forecasts for 2014 and 2015 are lowered as U.S. dairy products, especially on a skim solids basis, remain less competitive in world markets.  Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are raised for 2014, reflecting current price movements, but the price forecasts for 2015 are lowered as domestic supplies are expected to be relatively large.  Butter prices are reduced for both 2014 and 2015 based on prices to date and weaker expected exports.  Whey prices are unchanged from last month.  The Class III price for 2014 is raised on stronger cheese prices, but weaker cheese prices in 2015 result in a lower expected Class III price.  The Class IV price is lowered for 2014 as lower butter prices more than offset a higher NDM price.  For 2015 both butter and NDM prices will be weaker, resulting in a lower Class IV price forecast.  The all milk price is raised to $24.15 to $24.25 per cwt for 2014, but is lowered for 2015 to $18.85 to $19.75 per cwt.COTTON:  This month\u2019s U.S. cotton 2014/15 estimates include higher production and ending stocks.  Production is raised to 16.4 million bales, as increases for the Southwest and Southeast more than offset a reduction for the Delta.  Domestic mill use and exports are unchanged, resulting in ending stocks of 5.1 million bales.  The marketing-year average price received by producers is forecast to fall between 56.0 and 64.0 cents per pound, with the expected midpoint of 60 cents the same as last month.The global cotton 2014/15 forecasts also show only minor revisions this month, leaving ending stocks marginally higher.  Production is raised slightly as increases for Burma, the African Franc Zone, and the United States are mostly offset by reductions for China, Australia, and Uzbekistan.  Estimates for Burma\u2019s supply and demand are revised beginning in 2000/01 based on review of data sources for production and trade.  World consumption is raised marginally, owing to increases for Burma, which are mostly offset by a decrease for China.   ",
    "June_2017": "OILSEEDS:  This month\u2019s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2017/18 are little changed from last month.  Higher beginning stocks reflect a lower crush projection for 2016/17.  Soybean crush for 2016/17 is reduced 15 million bushels to 1,910 million mainly reflecting reduced domestic soybean meal disappearance.  Soybean ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 450 million bushels, up 15 million from last month.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are also raised 15 million bushels to 495 million.Price forecasts for 2017/18 are unchanged this month.  The 2017/18 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.30 to $10.30 per bushel; soybean meal and oil prices are projected at $295 to $335 per short ton and 30 to 34 cents per pound, respectively.The 2017/18 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production and stocks compared to last month.  Higher cottonseed and sunflowerseed production is partly offset by lower rapeseed.  Sunflowerseed production is raised for Ukraine on higher planted area based on reported planting progress to date.  EU rapeseed production is down mainly on lower projected yields in Germany where crops experienced dry and sub-freezing conditions through key flowering stages.  Global oilseed production changes for 2016/17 include higher soybean production in Brazil and Argentina and higher peanut production in India.  Global soybean production is raised 3.3 million tons to 351.3 million.  The Brazil soybean crop is projected up 2.4 million tons to 114.0 million reflecting increased yields in more recently harvested areas, particularly Rio Grande do Sul.  With higher global production in 2016/17, the beginning stocks for 2017/18 are raised 3.1 million tons to 93.2 million.  The larger beginning stocks combined with a 0.5-million-ton reduction to Argentina soybean exports in 2017/18 results in a 3.4-million-ton increase to 92.2 million to global soybean stocks at the end of the 2017/18 marketing year. SUGAR:  Beet sugar production for fiscal year 2016/17 is forecast at 4.988 million short tons, raw value (STRV), an increase of 56,000 over last month based on additional sugarbeets expected to be processed in August and September 2017 from the 2017/18 crop.  Texas cane sugar production for 2016/17 is increased 2,775 STRV to 138,300 based on final processor reporting.  Ending stocks are increased by the sum of the supply adjustments to 1.536 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.3 percent.Beet sugar production for 2017/18 is increased 38,000 STRV to 4.988 million based on analysis of this spring\u2019s planting pace and current crop conditions, and on the proportion of the 2017/18 sugarbeet crop expected to be processed before October 1.  Imports from Mexico are reduced by 526,396 STRV from last month to 1.774 million.  Ending stocks are decreased by the sum of the supply adjustments to 1.104 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 8.8 percent.Mexico 2016/17 sugar production is decreased by 201,245 metric tons (MT) to 5.985 million based on the production pace as the harvest season approaches its end.  Exports to other countries are increased by 40,000 MT to 150,000 based on the pace of exports to non-U.S. destinations and exports made to the U.S. re-export import program.  Ending stocks for 2016/17 are therefore reduced by 241,245 MT to 1.101 million.Mexico 2017/18 production is reduced 125,000 MT to 6.100 million based on area for harvest at 790,000 hectares, sugarcane production of 54.465 million MT, and recovery of 11.2 percent.  Imports, domestic deliveries for consumption and IMMEX, and exports to non-U.S. destinations are the same as last month.  Exports to the United States are reduced by 450,508 MT to 1.519 million.  Exports to the United States are based on the lower of the following: (1) U.S. Needs of 1.886 million MT as defined in the Suspension Agreements but assuming additionally that U.S. specialty sugar imports will be set at the same level as initially established for 2016/17; or (2) the export level that yields an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 18.0 percent.  The 18-percent stocks-to-consumption is an assumed lower bound necessary for use until mid-December 2018 when the new Mexico sugarcane harvest is well underway.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for total meat production is lowered from last month per 2017 but is raised for 2018. Beef production for 2017 is lowered primarily on lighter carcass weights which more than offsets higher expected slaughter in the later part of 2017.  Higher expected placements support a higher 2018 beef forecast.  Pork production for 2017 is lowered on the current pace of second-quarter slaughter and lighter carcass weights. No changes are made to the 2018 production forecast.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report will be released June 29 and will provide an indication of producer farrowing intentions for the remainder of 2017.  Broiler production for 2017 is lowered on the pace of second-quarter slaughter.  No changes are made to outlying quarters or the 2018 forecast.  Turkey production in the second quarter of 2017 is reduced on the current pace of slaughter, and third-quarter production is lowered as weak demand is expected to limit the rate of expansion.  No changes are made to the 2018 turkey forecast.  Egg production for 2017 is raised on recent hatchery data. Beef trade forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged from last month.  The pork export forecast for 2017 is unchanged from last month, but the import forecast is raised.  No changes are made to the 2018 pork trade forecasts.  The second-quarter broiler import forecast is lowered on recent trade data but no changes are made to outlying quarters.  No changes were made to the 2017 broiler export forecast, but the turkey export forecast was lowered on continued demand weakness.  Poultry trade forecasts are unchanged for 2018.Cattle and hog prices for 2017 are raised from last month on price strength to date and continued price strength in the third quarter.  Cattle prices are unchanged for 2018, while hog prices are raised on expected strong packer demand next year.  Broiler prices are raised for 2017 and first quarter 2018 on expectations of continued strong demand.  Turkey prices are reduced for 2017 and 2018 on weaker-than-expected demand.  Egg prices for 2017 are lowered fractionally, but the 2018 egg price forecast is unchanged.  Milk production forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are lowered from last month as lower expected growth in milk per cow more than offsets expected gains in cow numbers.  For 2017 and 2018, fat basis exports are reduced on the expectation that current high prices will temper export demand, but skim-solid basis exports are raised for both years on expected strength in nonfat dry milk/ skim milk powder demand.  The 2017 fat basis import forecast is raised on stronger imports of cheese and butterfat.  For 2018, lower expected imports of some processed dairy products more than offsets higher expected imports of cheese and butterfat, and the forecast for fat basis imports is lowered.  The skim-solid basis import forecasts are unchanged. Cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk (NDM) price forecasts are raised for both 2017 and 2018 on strong domestic and international demand and a reduced production forecast.  However, whey prices are reduced from last month for 2017, but raised for 2018.  For 2017, the Class III price is raised as the cheese price increase more than offsets the lower whey price, and the Class IV price forecasts reflects higher butter and NDM prices.  For 2018, Class prices are raised on higher component product prices.  The all milk price is forecast higher at $17.80 to $18.20 per cwt for 2017 and is increased to $18.10 to $19.10 per cwt for 2018.COTTON:  The U.S. cotton projections for 2017/18 show a reduction of 500,000 bales in exports from last month to 13.5 million, as higher anticipated foreign production is expected to reduce global import demand.  Beginning stocks, production and domestic mill use are unchanged.  Accordingly, ending stocks are now projected at 5.5 million bales which, if realized, would be a 9-year high.  The projected range for the 2017/18 marketing year average farm price of 54.0 to 74.0 cents per pound is unchanged from last month, while the price estimate for 2016/17 is reduced marginally to 68.5 cents.The 2017/18 world cotton projections include increases in global production, consumption, and ending stocks, while trade is reduced 2 percent.  Production is raised for Pakistan, China, and Mexico based on higher estimated planted area.  Higher global consumption reflects increases for China, India, and Pakistan which are largely due to higher domestic supplies.  China\u2019s consumption is raised in both 2016/17 and 2017/18, as sales from the national reserve and steady imports suggest that consumption there is stronger than previously estimated.  A reduction of nearly 800,000 bales in world imports results primarily from lower expected demand by Pakistan and Mexico.  Exports are lowered for the United States, India, Brazil and others.  World ending stocks are now projected at 87.7 million bales, the lowest since 2011/12.",
    "July_2017": "OILSEEDS:  U.S. oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 127.0 million tons, up 0.2 million from last month, with increases for soybeans, canola, and peanuts only partly offset with a lower forecast for sunflowerseed and cottonseed.  Soybean production is projected at 4,260 million bushels, up 5 million on increased harvested area.  Harvested area, estimated at 88.7 million acres in the June 30 Acreage report, is up 0.1 million from last month.  The soybean yield forecast is unchanged at 48.0 bushels per acre.  Despite slightly higher production, 2017/18 soybean supplies are reduced 35 million bushels on lower beginning stocks.  With projections for exports and crush unchanged, 2017/18 soybean ending stocks are reduced 35 million bushels to 465 million.Soybean exports for 2016/17 are projected at 2,100 million bushels, up 50 million, reflecting shipments and outstanding sales through early July.  Soybean crush is reduced 10 million bushels to 1,900 million on lower projected soybean meal exports and domestic use.  Soybean ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at 410 million bushels, down 40 million from last month.The U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $8.40 to $10.40 per bushel, up $0.10 at the midpoint.  Soybean meal prices are forecast at $300 to $340 per short ton, up $5.00 at the midpoint.  The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 30 to 34 cents per pound.The 2017/18 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include higher production, exports, and stocks compared to last month.  Global oilseed production for 2017/18 is projected at 573.9 million tons, up 0.9 million mostly on higher forecasts for Ukraine sunflowerseed, India cottonseed, U.S. peanuts, and China soybeans.  Partly offsetting is lower rapeseed production for Australia.  Ukraine sunflowerseed harvested area is raised in line with revisions for 2016/17, resulting in a higher production forecast.  Soybean production is raised for China due to increased harvested area. Global oilseed exports for 2017/18 are projected at 172.9 million tons, up 0.6 million mainly reflecting increased soybean exports for Brazil and Ukraine.  Soybean exports are also raised for 2016/17 as higher exports for the United States and Paraguay are partly offset by lower exports for Brazil and Argentina.  Global soybean imports are forecast higher principally for China where imports are projected up 2 million tons to 91 million in 2016/17 and 1 million tons to 94 million in 2017/18.  Global oilseed ending stocks for 2017/18 are up 1.0 million tons to 104.5 million mostly on higher soybean stocks in China and South America. SUGAR:  U.S. deliveries for human consumption for 2016/17 are increased by 100,000 short tons, raw value (STRV) to 12.300 million based on pace-to-date through the end of May.  Florida sugar production for 2016/17 is increased by 3,795 STRV to 2.055 million based on end-of-season processor reporting to the USDA.  Ending stocks are decreased by the sum of these adjustments to 1.440 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 11.4 percent.Imports for 2017/18 are increased by 225,445 STRV to 3.557 million.  The increase is comprised of 176,370 STRV of additional specialty sugar that enters under the 2017/18 refined sugar tariff-rate quota and an additional 49,075 STRV from Mexico.  Deliveries for human consumption are projected to increase one-percent over the estimate for 2016/17 to 12.423 million STRV.  Ending stocks for 2017/18 are projected at 1.132 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 9.0 percent.Mexico 2016/17 sugar imports intended for the IMMEX product re-export program are increased by 10,000 metric tons (MT) to 60,000 based on the pace to date.  Sugar exports for 2016/17 to non-U.S. destinations are increased by 15,000 MT to 165,000 based on the pace to date.  Exports to non-U.S. destinations for 2017/18 are decreased 15,000 MT to 10,000 based on expected higher-valued export alternatives to the U.S. market.  Deliveries for the IMMEX program for 2017/18 are reduced 60,000 MT to 330,000.  For 2017/18, exports to the United States are projected at 1.561 million MT.  These exports are projected as the lower of the following: (1) anticipated U.S. Needs of 2.048 million MT as defined in the Suspension Agreements; or (2) the export level that yields an ending stocks-to-consumption ratio of 18.0 percent.  The 18-percent stocks-to-consumption ratio is an assumed lower bound necessary for use until the new Mexico sugarcane harvest is well underway.LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  The forecast for 2017 red meat and poultry production is raised from last month as higher forecast beef and broiler production more than offset declines in pork and turkey production.  The beef production forecast is raised on both higher cattle slaughter and heavier carcass weights.  Forecast pork production is reduced as lower slaughter in mid-2017 more than offsets higher fourth-quarter slaughter.  Second-half carcass weights are reduced.  Broiler production is raised slightly on recent production data. Turkey production is lowered on recent production data and a slow recovery in demand during the second half of the year.  Egg production is unchanged.  For 2018, red meat and poultry production forecasts are reduced.  Forecast beef production is reduced from the previous month on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter in the first part of the year.  The pork production forecast is reduced.  USDA\u2019s Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report indicated that producers intend to farrow slightly more hogs over the next two quarters and growth in pigs per litter is expected to remain modest.  Forecast turkey production is reduced from last month as current price weakness is expected to slow the pace of growth.  Broiler and egg production forecasts are unchanged.The beef import forecast is raised for 2017 on recent trade data.  The beef export forecast is raised as global demand is expected to strengthen during the second half of the year.  For 2018, both beef import and export forecasts are raised.  Pork, poultry, and egg trade forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged from the previous month.  Cattle price forecasts for 2017 are lowered from last month as prices have weakened and fed cattle supplies will remain ample.  Forecast 2018 cattle prices are unchanged.  Hog price forecasts are raised for 2017 on strong domestic and export demand.  Demand strength is expected to carry over into 2018, and forecast hog prices are raised.  Broiler prices are raised for 2017 on current price strength, while turkey prices are lowered on weak demand. No changes are made for 2018 broiler and turkey price forecasts.  Egg prices are raised slightly for 2017 on recent data but no changes are made to 2018 forecasts. The 2017 and 2018 milk production forecasts are lowered from last month.  Growth in milk per cow has been slower than expected, and the forecast growth rate is reduced.Fat basis import forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged from the previous month.  Fat-basis export forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are raised on continued robust exports of cheese.  On a skim-solids basis, imports for 2017 were reduced from the previous month on lower expected purchases of milk protein concentrates (MPC), but the 2018 import forecast remains unchanged.  The 2018 skim solids import forecast remains unchanged.  Skim-solid exports for 2017 and 2018 are raised as nonfat dry milk (NDM) and cheese shipments are expected to remain strong.  For 2017, cheese and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month, while butter prices are forecast higher.  The NDM price forecast is unchanged but the range is narrowed.  Cheese prices for 2018 are reduced while butter prices are raised on continued strong demand.  NDM and whey price forecasts for 2018 are unchanged from last month.  The 2017 and 2018 Class III price forecasts are lowered from last month in line with lower component product prices.  The Class IV price forecasts are increased for 2017 and 2018 reflecting higher butter prices.  The 2017 all milk price is forecast at $17.65 to $17.95 and the price for 2018 is $18.00 to $19.00 per cwt.COTTON:  The U.S. 2017/18 cotton projections show production is 200,000 bales lower than last month.  With no change in domestic use or exports, ending stocks are also revised down 200,000 bales.  The decrease in the crop projection is attributed mainly to lower planted area as indicated in the June 30 Acreage report, combined with slightly less favorable assumptions about abandonment based on current conditions.  The projected range of 54 to 68 cents per pound for the marketing year average price received by producers is unchanged on the lower end and reduced 6 cents on the upper end; the midpoint of 61 cents is reduced 3 cents from last month.Higher production is increasing this month\u2019s global cotton stocks forecasts for both 2016/17 and 2017/18.  The world carryin for 2017/18 is increased 934,000 bales owing in large part to an upward revision of 500,000 bales for India\u2019s estimated 2016/17 crop.  World 2017/18 production is increased 636,000 bales, despite the lower expected U.S. crop, mainly on increased area expectations for India.  Production is also raised for Turkey, but is lowered for Pakistan and Mexico.  World consumption is also forecast higher in both 2016/17\u2014up nearly 200,000 bales\u2014and 2017/18\u2014up more than 500,000 bales.  World 2017/18 ending stocks are now projected at 88.7 million bales, an increase of 1.0 million from the June forecast."
