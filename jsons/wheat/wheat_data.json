    "November_2019": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. wheat this month is for smaller supplies, reduced domestic use, and lower stocks.  Wheat supplies are decreased 42 million bushels, based on updated production estimates for the States resurveyed following the NASS Small Grains Summary, issued September 30.  Adjustments to production in these States, where significant acreage remained unharvested in early September, lowers production estimates for Hard Red Spring wheat, White wheat, and Durum with most reductions occurring in North Dakota and Montana.  Estimated seed use is reduced 7 million bushels to 61 million, reflecting a projected 2020/21 all wheat planted acreage of 45.0 million.  Food use is lowered 5 million bushels to 955 million, primarily based on the NASS Flour Milling Products report, issued November 1.  Projected 2019/20 wheat stocks are reduced 30 million bushels to 1,014 million.  The season-average farm price is reduced $0.10 per bushel to $4.60, based on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for cash and futures prices the remainder of the 2019/20 marketing year.The global outlook for wheat this month is for higher supplies, increased exports, fractionally greater consumption, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are raised with increased production forecasts for the EU, Russia, and Ukraine more than offsetting reductions for Argentina and Australia.  EU and Russia production forecasts are raised to 153.0 and 74.0 million tons, respectively, on updated harvest results.  Australia\u2019s production is lowered to 17.2 million tons on further damage from the continent\u2019s severe drought and is now forecast lower than last year\u2019s drought-affected crop.  Argentina\u2019s production is reduced to 20.0 million tons on dry conditions but remains record large.  World exports are raised by 1.0 million tons to 180.7 million on increases for the EU, Russia, and Ukraine more than offsetting reductions for Argentina and Australia.  Global consumption is nearly unchanged at 755.2 million tons, which is 3 percent greater than last year.  With global supplies rising more than consumption, 2019/20 ending stocks are raised to a record 288.3 million tons with China comprising 51 percent of the total.",
    "September_2016": "WHEAT:  The U.S. 2016/17 wheat supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month. The marketing year average price received by producers is lowered $0.10 per bushel at the midpoint to a range of $3.30 to $3.90.  The reduction is due to lower than expected prices to date.  Global wheat supplies for 2016/17 are raised 0.4 million tons on a 1.4-million-ton production increase that is partially offset by decreased beginning stocks.  Production increases for India, Kazakhstan, Australia, Brazil, and Canada are partially offset by reductions for the EU and China.  Most changes are attributable to harvest reports and government data.  The Australia increase is based on continued excellent growing conditions thus far in the growing season, with yields projected to be nearly record high.  Brazil is also experiencing favorable growing conditions with yields projected record high.  Global exports are raised 2.1 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Australia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Kazakhstan, both on larger crops.  Export gains are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton decrease in EU exports on the continued decline in supplies.  Total global use is up 4.2 million tons with increases in both food and feed use.  With total use rising faster than supplies, world ending stocks are lowered 3.8 million tons but remain record large.  ",
    "September_2017": "WHEAT:  The U.S. 2017/18 wheat supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month.  The season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per bushel at the midpoint to a range of $4.30 to $4.90.  The reduction is due to NASS prices to date and expectations of future cash prices.  Global wheat supplies for 2017/18 are lowered as a 1.7-million-ton production increase is offset by a 2.7-million-ton decrease in beginning stocks.  The primary production increase is for Russia, which is raised 3.5 million tons to a record 81.0 million tons; this change is based on excellent growing conditions and updated harvest results.  Australia production for 2017/18 is lowered 1.0 million tons on dry conditions, and the EU is lowered 0.7 million tons.  In addition, historical production changes for Australia led to lower global ending stocks.  The 2015/16 Australia production change is on updated Australia Bureau of Statistics data which lowered harvested area 1.5 million hectares.  Australia\u2019s 2016/17 harvested area is lowered 0.5 million hectares.  Global trade for 2017/18 is essentially unchanged.  However, exports are increased 1.0 million tons for Russia on the larger crop, 0.5 million tons for Ukraine, and 0.3 million tons for Turkey.  These are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for EU exports and a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Australia.  Total global use is up 0.5 million tons.  With total supplies declining and use increasing, global ending stocks are lowered 1.6 million tons.  ",
    "November_2018": "WHEAT:  Supplies for the 2018/19 U.S. wheat crop are unchanged this month, and total use is raised 7 million bushels on higher seed use that reflects increased projected 2019/20 wheat planted area.  Small offsetting by-class changes are made for wheat imports and exports.  Food use is unchanged based on the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report, issued November 1.  Projected ending stocks are lowered 7 million bushels to 949 million.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at the midpoint of $5.10 per bushel and the range is narrowed to $4.90 to $5.30.  Global 2018/19 wheat supplies are raised 6.7 million tons on both increased production and beginning stocks.  The vast majority of this change stems from the updated production data released by China\u2019s NBS, which made significant production changes from 2007/08 through 2017/18.  In addition, China\u2019s 2018/19 production forecast is raised with both higher harvested area and yield, based on the NBS revisions.  Total 2018/19 global production is raised 2.6 million tons, but is down 1.9 million tons excluding the China revision.  Australia\u2019s crop is lowered 1.0 million tons to 17.5 million on continued drought.  Morocco, Pakistan, and Ukraine are lowered 0.9, 0.8, and 0.5 million tons, respectively.  A 0.9-million-ton production increase for Algeria is partly offsetting.  Global exports are lowered 1.6 million tons with almost all of that from Australia reflecting the smaller crop.  Australia exports are lowered 1.5 million tons to 11.5 million, the lowest total since 2007/08.  Global use is raised 0.2 million tons, but includes a 1.0-million-ton increase for China reflecting higher feed and residual use and larger supplies.  With supplies rising more than use, global ending stocks are raised 6.5 million tons to 266.7 million.  However, stocks outside of China are down 0.9 million tons.",
    "July_2019": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. wheat this month is for lower supplies, higher domestic use, larger exports, and reduced stocks.  Supplies are reduced as a smaller carry-in is not completely offset by higher production.  Forecast 2019/20 U.S. wheat production is raised 18 million bushels to 1,921 million.  The all wheat yield is forecast 1.3 bushels per acre higher at 50.0 bushels.  Winter wheat production is raised to 1,291 million bushels with increases in all winter wheat classes this month.  The first 2019/20 survey-based production forecasts for other spring wheat and Durum are both lower than last year, mainly on reduced harvested area at 572 and 58 million bushels, respectively.  Domestic use is higher this month on increased feed and residual use as wheat is expected to be more competitively priced with feedgrains in 2019/20.  Exports are projected at 950 million bushels, up 14 million from the revised 2018/19 exports.  Exportable supplies for several major exporters are significantly reduced on lower 2019/20 production forecasts.  As a result, the United States is expected to improve its export competitiveness, especially in the latter stages of the 2019/20 marketing year.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are projected 72 million bushels lower than last month at 1,000 million.  The projected season-average farm price is $5.20 per bushel, up $0.10 from last month on reduced stocks.  Foreign 2019/20 wheat supplies are decreased 10.5 million tons primarily on lower production in several major exporting countries.  The production declines are led by a 3.8-million-ton reduction for Russia due to extremely high temperatures and below-average precipitation in June during winter wheat grain fill.  Russia\u2019s production of 74.2 million tons is still the second largest on record.  Both the EU and Ukraine are also lowered on hot and dry conditions during June, which are expected to reduce yields although production in both countries remains well above last year.  Australia and Canada are lowered as well, mainly on reduced area, based on recent government reports.  Global 2019/20 exports are lowered 2.3 million tons on decreased supplies.  Russia\u2019s exports are reduced 2.5 million tons and Australia and Ukraine are lowered 1.0 million and 0.5 million, respectively.  These export reductions are partially offset by a 0.5 million ton increase for the EU and a 1.4 million increase for the United States.  World consumption is lowered 2.9 million tons, primarily on reduced feed and residual use.  With global supplies declining more than projected use, world ending stocks are reduced 7.9 million tons to 286.5 million but remain record large.",
    "June_2019": "WHEAT:  U.S. 2019/20 wheat supplies are down with lower beginning stocks partly offset by slightly higher production.  Beginning stocks are down 25 million bushels on increased 2018/19 exports.  Winter wheat production is forecast up 6 million bushels to 1,274 million with an increase to Hard Red Winter more than offsetting decreases for Soft Red Winter and White Winter.  Total wheat production is now forecast at 1,903 million bushels, up 5.8 million bushels from the May forecast.  Exports for 2019/20 are unchanged at 900 million bushels but feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels to 140 million on reduced projected corn supplies.  Ending stocks are lowered 69 million bushels to 1,072 million, and the season-average farm price is raised $0.40 per bushel to $5.10.  The price increase reflects sharply higher wheat futures prices and reduced 2019/20 corn supplies.  World 2019/20 wheat supplies are raised 4.9 million tons on a 1.6-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 3.3-million-ton increase in global production.  India\u2019s wheat crop is raised 1.2 million tons on updated government data.  Production in Russia and Ukraine are each raised 1.0 million tons reflecting favorable weather to date.  Projected 2019/20 global trade is expanded 0.8 million tons with a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine, both due to larger crops.  Russian exports are now projected at 37.0 million tons and Ukraine exports are projected at a record 19.5 million.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton decrease for EU exports with greater competition from Black Sea origins.  Projected 2019/20 world consumption is raised 3.6 million tons on both higher food and feed and residual use.  With supplies rising more than use, ending stocks are projected up 1.3 million tons to a record 294.3 million.  ",
    "September_2015": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. exports for 2015/16 are lowered 25 million bushels to 900 million on increased foreign supplies.  Ending stocks are increased by the same amount to 875 million bushels, which are the largest since the 2009/10 crop year.  The season-average farm price is lowered 20 cents on the high end to $4.65 to $5.35 per bushel.  The reduction reflects increased competition for U.S. wheat and growing domestic stocks.  Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 6.7 million tons, primarily on increased production in the EU and FSU.  Partly offsetting are reductions in Canada and India.  EU yields are significantly better than expected and the 2015 crop is now only 2.3 million tons below last year\u2019s record.  Partly offsetting are reductions in Canada and India.  These production changes reflect harvest reports and updated government estimates to date.  The global wheat crop is now projected at 731.6 million tons and the third consecutive record.  World beginning stocks are up 1.6 million tons, led by a large increase for Canada as reported by Statistics Canada.  World exports are higher with by far the biggest increase for the EU, which is raised 1.5 million tons on the much larger crop.  Ukraine was raised 0.5 million tons also on a larger crop.  Partially offsetting is a 0.7-million-ton reduction for the United States due to increased foreign competition.  Global imports are up, with the biggest increases being 0.5 million tons for Brazil and 0.3 million tons for Philippines.  EU imports are reduced 0.5 million tons and Indonesia is reduced 0.3 million tons.  Global use is up 1.6 million tons on increased feed use, especially in the EU and Russia and the Philippines.  Reductions in food use are partially offsetting.  With supplies growing much faster than use, global ending stocks are raised 5.1 million tons to a record 226.6 million tons.",
    "September_2014": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 10 million bushels with higher expected imports of Hard Red Spring (HRS) from Canada.  This reflects higher stocks in Canada as well as the strong shipment pace to date.  Domestic use is unchanged, but exports are lowered 25 million bushels with larger global wheat supplies and increased competition.  Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat exports are lowered 15 million bushels due to the slow pace of sales and shipments to date.  HRS wheat exports are lowered 10 million bushels with increased competition expected from Canada.  A 5-million-bushel increase in Soft Red Winter wheat exports is offset by a 5-million-bushel reduction for White wheat.  Projected all wheat ending stocks are raised 35 million bushels.  The projected range for the 2014/15 season-average farm price is lowered 40 cents at the midpoint to $5.50 to $6.30 per bushel.  Global 2014/15 wheat supplies are raised 6.6 million tons with increases in both beginning stocks and production.  Beginning stocks are up 2.8 million tons led by a 2-million-ton increase for China.  The China increase reflects a 2013/14 reduction in wheat feeding; however, wheat feeding is raised for 2014/15.  Both changes are made to better reflect relative prices for wheat and corn in China since summer 2013.  Canada beginning stocks are up 0.8 million tons reflecting the latest stocks estimate from Statistics Canada.  World production is raised 3.9 million tons to a record 720.0 million.  The largest production increases are for EU and Ukraine, up 3.1 million tons and 2.0 million tons, respectively.  Both changes reflect updated government data.  Australia production is down 0.5 million tons reflecting persistent dryness in the northeastern growing areas and developing dryness in the more important western and southeastern growing regions.  Other major production changes include a 0.4-million-ton increase for Morocco and a 1-million-ton reduction for Algeria.Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is raised 3.2 million tons mostly reflecting the higher feed use expected for China.  Wheat feeding is also raised 0.5 million tons for Iran.  Global wheat trade is raised with the largest import increases for Algeria, Pakistan, and Iran.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons each for Canada, EU, and Ukraine all due to larger supplies.  Exports are raised 0.5 million tons each for Brazil and Kazakhstan also because of large supplies.  Despite record projected consumption, global wheat supplies rise faster than use, boosting ending stocks 3.4 million tons to 196.4 million.",
    "June_2018": "WHEAT:  U.S. 2018/19 wheat supplies are increased slightly this month on higher beginning stocks and production.  Winter wheat is forecast up 6 million bushels to 1,198 million with modest increases in all winter wheat classes and total wheat production is now at 1,827 million.  U.S. exports are raised 25 million bushels to 950 million on tightening Russian exportable supplies.  Projected 2018/19 ending stocks are lowered 9 million bushels to 946 million, down 12 percent from last year.  The projected season-average farm price is up $0.10 per bushel with the midpoint at $5.10, compared to the revised 2017/18 price of $4.75. World 2018/19 wheat supplies decreased this month by 1.2 million tons on production declines in Russia, the EU, and Mexico not completely offset by higher projected production from India and the United States.  Russia\u2019s production is lowered by 3.5 million tons to 68.5 million on drier-than-normal conditions this spring in winter wheat areas and excessive wetness in spring wheat regions lowering plantings.  Russia\u2019s wheat production is projected down 19 percent from last year\u2019s record 85.0 million tons.  EU wheat production is reduced 1.0 million tons to 149.4 million on dry conditions this spring for winter wheat in Germany and Poland.  India\u2019s wheat production is raised 2.0 million tons to 97.0 million, based on record yields and supported by reports of higher procurement for the 2018/19 crop compared to last year.  Projected global 2018/19 trade is lower, mainly on reduced Russian exportable supplies with a smaller crop.  Russia\u2019s exports are reduced 1.5 million tons to 35.0 million, but Russia still remains the world\u2019s leading wheat exporter.  Global imports are lowered, mainly on reduced imports for India as the government recently raised its wheat import tariff.  Projected 2018/19 world consumption is 3.0 million tons lower, primarily on reduced feed usage for Russia and the EU.   Global ending stocks are raised 1.8 million tons this month to 266.2 million but are still below last year\u2019s record 272.4 million.   ",

Forecast 2018/19 U.S. wheat production is raised 54 million bushels to 1,881 million.  The NASS July Crop Production report provides survey-based production forecasts for all wheat classes for the first time in the 2018/19 crop year.  The production forecast for durum and other spring wheat are up from last year\u2019s low level due to improved yields and higher spring wheat area.  Winter wheat production is down slightly from the June forecast.  Ending stocks for 2018/19 are raised 39 million bushels this month but are 11 percent below last year\u2019s revised stocks.  The 2018/19 season-average farm price is lowered $0.10 per bushel at the midpoint to a projected range of $4.50 to $5.50.  Foreign 2018/19 wheat supplies are decreased 9.3 million tons primarily on lower production, which is the smallest in three years.  The production declines are led by a 4.4-million-ton reduction for the EU reflecting continued dryness especially in the north.  Australia, Russia, and Ukraine are lowered 2.0 million, 1.5 million, and 1.0 million tons, respectively, and also reflect continued dryness.  China production is reduced 1.0 million tons on lower harvested area as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture.  Global 2018/19 exports are lowered 1.9 million tons on decreased supplies.  EU exports are reduced 1.5 million tons and Australia and Russia are both lowered 1.0 million tons.  These export reductions are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Canada and a 0.7-million-ton increase for the United States.  Total foreign consumption for 2018/19 is lowered 2.3 million tons on both lower food and feed and residual use.  With global supplies declining more than projected use, world ending stocks are reduced 5.3 million tons to 260.9 million.  ",
    "July_2020": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. wheat this month is for larger supplies, lower domestic use, unchanged exports, and increased stocks.  Supplies are raised as larger beginning stocks more than offset lower production.  Beginning stocks are increased on the NASS Grain Stocks report, issued June 30, which indicated higher 2019/20 ending stocks than previously estimated.  This also resulted in lowering 2019/20 feed and residual use by 61 million bushels to 74 million.  Wheat production for 2020/21 is reduced 53 million bushels to 1,824 million.  Winter wheat production is lowered 48 million bushels to 1,218 million with reductions in Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter.  The initial 2020/21 survey-based production forecasts for other spring and Durum were issued this month by NASS.  Other spring wheat is less than last year at 550 million bushels on lower forecast yields while Durum is higher at 56 million on increased harvested area.  Domestic use is 10 million bushels lower this month, all on reduced feed and residual use as 2020/21 U.S. corn supplies are still projected significantly larger than last year.  Projected 2020/21 exports are unchanged at 950 million bushels but there were several offsetting by-class changes this month.  Ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected 17 million bushels higher than last month at 942 million.  The projected season-average farm price (SAFP) is unchanged at $4.60 per bushel, compared to the revised 2019/20 SAFP of $4.58. The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for smaller supplies, reduced consumption, lower exports, and decreased stocks.  Supplies are reduced 2.9 million tons to 1,066 million as larger beginning stocks are more than offset by reduced production, primarily in the EU, United States, Morocco, and Russia.  EU production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 139.5 million, mainly on reductions for France and Spain.  If realized, this would be the smallest EU wheat production since 2012/13.  Morocco is lowered 800,000 tons to 2.7 million, the smallest output since 2007/08, primarily on updated government estimates.  Russia is reduced 500,000 tons to 76.5 million as lower winter wheat production is partially offset by increased spring wheat output.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is reduced 0.8 million tons to 188.0 million as lower EU exports are only partially offset by higher Australian exports.  World consumption is lowered 1.6 million tons to 751.6 million, primarily on reduced feed and residual use in the EU, the United States, and Morocco.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 1.3 million tons to 314.8 million but remain record-large with China and India accounting for 51 and 10 percent of the total, respectively.  ",

India production is raised 4.2 million tons, and Australia is up 2.0 million, both on updated government statistics.  India\u2019s crop is projected to be record-large, and Australia\u2019s crop is expected to rebound on improved conditions following two consecutive years of drought.  Turkey and China are both increased by 1.0 million tons.  Partly offsetting these changes are crop reductions of 2.0 million tons for the EU and 1.5 million for Ukraine, both reflecting dry conditions during key parts of the growing season.  Projected 2020/21 global exports are raised 0.9 million tons to 188.9 million, led by a 2.0-million-ton increase for Australia on larger supplies, and a 1.0-million increase for Russia on reduced export competition from Ukraine.  Exports are lowered 1.5 million tons for Ukraine and 0.5 million for the EU, both on smaller crops.

Supplies are projected up 1.3 million tons to 1,059.0 million based on increases in beginning stocks and production.  World production is raised 1.0 million tons to 782.7 million as larger production in Australia, Kazakhstan, and the UK more than offsets declines in Argentina and the EU.  Production in Australia is raised 1.5 million tons to 34.5 million as above average rain over the past month supported crop development and boosted yields, following widespread favorable conditions earlier in the growing season.  Argentina production is lowered as continued widespread dry conditions through most of October further eroded yield potential, especially in northern areas.  Feed and residual use is raised 0.9 million tons as increases in the EU, South Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam more than offset a decline in India.  However, FSI consumption is lowered 1.5 million tons primarily on decreases for Bangladesh and Indonesia.  The global forecast for trade is increased 0.3 million tons to a record 208.7 million, primarily on higher exports from Australia, Kazakhstan, and the UK that more than offset a reduction in exports by Argentina.

The all wheat yield is 50.7 bushels per acre, up 0.7 bushels from last month.  Beginning stocks declined due to higher 2020/21 exports, which were raised 20 million bushels to 985 million, primarily on larger recent monthly exports.  Feed and residual use is raised 10 million bushels to 180 million on the higher supplies as wheat is expected to be priced competitively with corn in the summer months.

Partially offsetting this decrease is higher winter wheat production, both on increased harvested acreage and a higher yield.  Imports are raised 20 million bushels to 145 million.  Beginning stocks are reduced on the latest NASS Grain Stocks report, which indicated lower 2020/2021 ending stocks than previously estimated.  Projected exports and feed and residual usage are lowered to 875 and 170 million bushels, respectively, on the reduction in durum and other spring wheat supplies.  These would be the smallest U.S. wheat exports since the 2015/16 marketing year.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are reduced 105 million bushels to 665 million and are the lowest since 2013/14.  The projected 2021/22 season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per bushel to $6.60.  The global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for reduced supplies, fractionally lower consumption, increased trade, and lower ending stocks.  Supplies are projected to decline 5.3 million tons to 1,082.6 million on reduced beginning stocks in several countries and lower U.S. production not offsetting higher foreign production.  Global production is lowered 2.0 million tons to 792.4 million but still remains at a record.  Australia\u2019s production is raised 1.5 million tons to 28.5 million, based on continued widespread precipitation benefiting emergence and crop establishment.  Russia\u2019s production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 85.0 million.  Winter wheat production is reduced 0.5 million tons to 64.0 million on decreased harvested area from a damaging early spring freeze more than offsetting higher yields on continued favorable conditions across Western Russia.  Spring wheat is also lowered 0.5 million tons to 21.0 million on reduced yields with hot and dry conditions affecting the spring wheat region of Central Russia.  Kazakhstan is lowered 1.0 million tons to 13.0 million on similar unfavorable conditions.  The EU and United Kingdom are increased a combined 1.4 million tons to 138.2 and 14.8 million, respectively on continued favorable conditions across Northern and Central Europe. Projected 2021/22 world consumption is fractionally lower at 790.9 million on lower feed and residual use in Russia, the United States, and Kazakhstan mostly being offset by higher food, seed, and industrial use in several countries.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is raised 0.8 million tons to a record 204.0 million, on increased exports by the EU, Ukraine, and Australia offsetting reductions in Canada, Kazakhstan, and the United States.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are lowered 5.1 million tons to 291.7 million but remain above last year.   ",
    "November_2020": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2020/21 U.S. wheat this month is for stable supplies, higher domestic use, unchanged exports, and reduced ending stocks.  Domestic use is raised, primarily on higher food use, which is increased 5 million bushels to 965 million, up from 962 million for 2019/20.  This increase is based mainly on the NASS Flour Milling Products report, which indicated higher food use for the early part of the marketing year than previously estimated.  All wheat exports and imports are unchanged this month but there were offsetting by-class changes for both exports and imports.  Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are reduced 6 million bushels to 877 million, down 15 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $4.70 per bushel.  The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for larger supplies, increased consumption, higher exports, and reduced stocks.  Supplies are raised 0.7 million tons to 1,073.1 million as higher beginning stocks offset lower global production, which remains at a record.  Most of this month\u2019s production decrease is for Argentina, where production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 18.0 million.  The lingering impacts of drought and local freeze damage have caused Argentina\u2019s forecast yield to be the lowest in eight years.  World consumption is increased 1.7 million tons to 752.7 million, mainly on higher feed and residual use for China and the EU.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 0.9 million tons to 190.8 million on higher exports for Russia and the EU more than offsetting lower Argentina exports.  Increases in imports are led by China, Pakistan, and Turkey.  China\u2019s import pace continues to be robust and at 8.0 million tons, imports would be the largest since 1995/96.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 1.0 million tons to 320.5 million but remain record high. ",
    "September_2013": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2013/14 are raised 10 million bushels with higher expected imports from a larger wheat crop in Canada.  U.S. trade and food use changes by class largely reflect higher projected exports by Canada.  Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat imports are raised 10 million bushels and Durum imports are raised 5 million bushels.  Partly offsetting is a 5-million-bushel reduction in projected Soft Red Winter wheat imports.  Food use is raised 10 million bushels for HRS wheat and lowered 10 million bushels for Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat.  HRS wheat exports are lowered 10 million bushels reflecting increased competition from Canadian spring wheat.  HRW wheat exports are raised an offsetting 10 million bushels on the strong pace of sales and shipments in recent weeks.  Projected all wheat ending stocks are raised 10 million bushels.  The projected range for the 2013/14 season-average farm price is narrowed 10 cents on each end of the range to $6.50 to $7.50 per bushel, well below the 2012/13 record of $7.77 per bushel.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are raised 3.0 million tons with increased production more than offsetting lower beginning stocks.  World wheat production is projected at a record 708.9 million tons, up 3.5 million this month.  Higher production in Canada, the European Union (EU), and the FSU-12 more than offsets reductions for Iran and Paraguay.  Production is raised 2.0 million tons for Canada as cool July weather supported flowering and reproduction, and abundant soil moisture and favorably warm, dry weather in August aided grain fill and maturity across the Prairie Provinces. EU production is raised 1.5 million tons as harvest results confirm increases from the United Kingdom and Germany in the west to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in the east.  Small increases are also made this month for Poland and the Czech Republic, both in the EU, and for non-member Serbia.  FSU-12 production is raised 1.0 million tons as harvest results boost production 0.5 million tons for Ukraine and smaller increases are reported for Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.  Production is lowered 1.0 million tons for Iran and 0.4 million tons for Paraguay.Global wheat consumption for 2013/14 is lowered slightly as reduced wheat feed use for Australia, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia is partly offset by higher feeding in Canada and Brazil and higher food use in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Indonesia.  Global wheat trade is raised with higher imports expected for Egypt, Iran, and Brazil.  Import reductions for South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam limit the global import increase.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons for the EU and 0.5 million tons for Canada, both with larger crops.  Partly offsetting these increases are export reductions of 0.4 million tons for the UAE and 0.3 million tons each for Paraguay and Uzbekistan.  With global consumption down slightly, higher production boosts projected global ending stocks 3.3 million tons.  World wheat stocks are now expected to increase during 2013/14.",
    "November_2021": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. wheat this month is for lower supplies, higher domestic use, reduced exports, and slightly higher ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced on lower anticipated imports, down 10 million bushels to 115 million on a continued weak import pace.  Higher anticipated seed use for the 2022/23 crop more than offsets lower expected food use driven by a slower-than-expected pace of flour milling as reported in the quarterly NASS Flour Milling Products report.  As a result, total domestic use is projected 2 million bushels higher at 1,163 million.  Exports are lowered 15 million bushels to 860 million, on lower anticipated exports of Hard Red Spring and White wheat based on high domestic prices and muted export sales.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are raised slightly to 583 million bushels, up 3 million from last month\u2019s forecast but still the lowest U.S. ending stocks since 2007/08.  The projected 2021/22 season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per bushel to $6.90 on reported NASS prices to date and expectations on cash and futures prices for the remainder of the marketing year. The global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for reduced supplies, slightly higher consumption, increased trade, and lower ending stocks.  Supplies are projected down by 1.0 million tons to 1,063.2 million based on decreases in beginning stocks and production.  World production is lowered 0.6 million tons to 775.3 million as decreases in the EU, the UK, and Uzbekistan more than offset an increase for Russia.  EU production is lowered primarily due to downward revisions in France and Germany that are only partially offset by an increase in production in Romania.  Russian wheat production is estimated 2.0 million tons higher to 74.5 million based on Ministry of Agriculture harvest results that lowered harvested area but increased yields for both winter and spring wheat.  World consumption is raised 0.4 million tons to 787.2 million, primarily on feed and residual changes as increases for Russia, Iran, and Turkey more than offset reductions for the EU, the UK, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.  The global forecast for trade is increased 3.5 million tons to a record 203.2 million, primarily on higher exports from the EU, India, Russia, and Ukraine.

NASS raised winter wheat production to 1,182 million bushels as increases for Soft Red Winter and White Winter more than offset a reduction for Hard Red Winter.  The all wheat yield is 46.9 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels from last month.  Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are raised 8 million bushels to 627 million, still down 4 percent from 2021/22.  The projected 2022/23 season-average farm price is unchanged at $10.75 per bushel, compared to $7.70 for 2021/22.The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 is for lower supplies, reduced consumption, fractionally lower trade, and slightly lower ending stocks.  Supplies are decreased by 1.7 million tons to 1,052.8 million as lower India production more than offsets an increase for Russia.  India\u2019s production is lowered 2.5 million tons to 106.0 million as extreme temperatures in March and April reduced yields during grain fill.  Russia\u2019s production is raised 1.0 million tons to 81.0 million with all of the increase in winter wheat on generally favorable weather conditions to date.  Projected 2022/23 world consumption is reduced 1.5 million tons to 786.0 million mainly on lower feed and residual use for India and less food, seed, and industrial use for Sri Lanka and Argentina. Projected 2022/23 global trade is decreased 0.3 million tons to 204.6 million as lower exports from India are not completely offset by higher exports from Russia and Uzbekistan.  India\u2019s exports are reduced 2.0 million tons to 6.5 million as the government intends to restrict exports to some destinations to ensure sufficient domestic supplies.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised 1.0 million tons to 40.0 million, which would be the second largest on record.  Russia\u2019s supplies are projected higher for 2022/23 and its export prices are more competitive than most other exporters.

Supplies are raised on increased production, which is up 44 million bushels to 1,781 million, on an increase in harvested area and higher yields.  The first 2022 survey-based production forecast for other spring and Durum indicated a large increase from last year\u2019s drought-reduced output at 503 million and 77 million bushels, respectively.  Winter wheat production is also forecast higher at 1,201 million bushels on an increase in harvested area.  The 2022/23 export forecast is raised 25 million bushels to 800 million as the recent decline in U.S. prices makes exports more competitive in international markets.  The projected season-average farm price (SAFP) is lowered $0.25 per bushel to $10.50 on declines in futures and cash prices.The 2022/23 global wheat outlook is for fewer supplies, reduced consumption, higher exports, and increased stocks.  Supplies are reduced 1.1 million tons to 1,051.7 million as less production is partially offset by larger beginning stocks.  Production is revised lower for the EU, Ukraine, and Argentina, which is only partially offset by upward revisions for Canada, the United States, and Russia.  EU production is lowered 2.0 million tons to 134.1 million, as ongoing dry weather lowered yield prospects primarily in Spain, Italy, and Germany.  Ukraine production is lowered 2.0 million tons to 19.5 million on a reduction in harvested area, as indicated by government statistics.  Production in Canada is increased 1.0 million tons to 34.0 million on the Statistics Canada Principal Field Crop Areas survey showing higher planted area than intentions.  Projected 2022/23 global trade is raised 0.9 million tons to 205.5 million as higher exports from Canada and the United States are only partially offset by lower exports from Argentina and the EU.  World consumption is lowered 1.8 million tons to 784.2 million, primarily on reduced feed and residual use in the EU and Ukraine.

The season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per bushel to $7.15 based on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for prices in the remainder of the marketing year. The 2021/22 global wheat outlook is for stable supplies, decreased consumption, reduced exports, and increased stocks.  Production increases in Argentina and the EU are offset by decreased production in Brazil and Paraguay and lower beginning stocks for Russia.  Argentina\u2019s production is increased 0.5 million tons to a record 20.5 million on updated harvest results.  Russian beginning stocks are lowered 0.6 million tons on larger end-of-season exports in 2020/21.  World 2021/22 consumption is lowered 1.9 million tons to 787.5 million, primarily due to lower feed and residual use for the United States, the EU, and Ukraine.  Relatively higher wheat prices compared to feed grains are expected to reduce global feed use.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is lowered 1.1 million tons to 204.4 million as reductions in exports for Russia and the United States are only partially offset by higher exports from the EU.  Russia recently announced a wheat export quota of 8.0 million tons from mid-February until the end of June, which is expected to constrain their exports in the latter half of the marketing year.

The projected season-average farm price is $4.70 per bushel, down from last year\u2019s estimated $5.20 on the expectation of greater export competition and lower U.S. corn prices.  The initial outlook for 2019/20 international wheat is for larger supplies, increased trade, greater consumption, and higher ending stocks.  Foreign supplies are projected to increase 38.5 million tons to 966.4 million as all of the major wheat exporters (Argentina, Australia, Canada, EU, Russia, and Ukraine) are expected to have higher production for 2019/20.  The EU is projected to have the largest increase to 153.8 million tons, as it recovers from last year\u2019s drought.

Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are raised 25 million bushels to 678 million but are still 20 percent lower than last year.  The projected season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised $0.10 per bushel to $7.60 on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for cash and futures prices for the remainder of 2021/22.  This would be the highest SAFP since 2012/13.The global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for slightly higher supplies, increased consumption, lower trade, and reduced ending stocks.  Supplies are increased by 0.7 million tons to 1,069.5 million on a combination of higher beginning stocks for Pakistan, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia and higher production for Pakistan and Argentina more than offsetting lower EU production.  Projected 2021/22 world consumption is raised 3.8 million tons to 791.1 million primarily on higher food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use for India.  Based on greater offtake from government stocks to food distribution programs, India\u2019s FSI is raised 4.4 million tons to a record 100.9 million.   Projected 2021/22 global trade is lowered 3.0 million tons to 200.1 million as lower exports by the EU, Ukraine, the United States, and Kazakhstan are not completely offset by higher exports by Russia, Brazil, and Argentina.  EU exports are reduced 3.5 million tons to 34.0 million on a lower-than-expected pace.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised 1.0 million tons to 33.0 million as it continues to export at competitive prices.  Ukraine\u2019s exports are lowered 1.0 million tons to 19.0 million as its Black Sea ports remain closed since the invasion by Russia in February.  The majority of Ukraine\u2019s exports have already been shipped with limited additional amounts expected for the remainder of 2021/22.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are lowered 3.1 million tons to 278.4 million with India accounting for most of the reduction that is only partially offset by higher EU stocks.  Global stocks are projected at a   5-year low.   ",
    "October_2022": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. wheat this month is for lower supplies, domestic use, exports, and stocks.  Supplies are reduced on lower 2022/23 production based on the NASS Small Grains Summary that indicated reductions in both harvested area and yield.  This lowered production by 133 million bushels to 1,650 million, leaving production only minimally higher than last year.  Partially offsetting the production decline are higher projected imports, raised 10 million bushels to 120 million, all for Hard Red Spring.  Annual feed and residual use is lowered 30 million bushels to 50 million, based on first quarter disappearance, as indicated in the NASS Grain Stocks report.  This is the lowest first quarter total disappearance since 1983/84.  Wheat exports are lowered 50 million bushels to 775 million on reduced supplies, slow pace of export sales, and continued uncompetitive U.S. export prices.  This would be the lowest U.S. wheat exports since 1971/72.  Projected ending stocks are lowered 34 million bushels to 576 million, which would be the lowest since 2007/08.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per bushel to $9.20 on reported NASS prices to date and expectations for futures and cash prices for the remainder of 2022/23. The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 wheat is for reduced supplies, consumption, trade, and stocks.  Supplies are lowered 1.9 million tons to 1,057.7 million on reduced production for the United States and Argentina more than offsetting higher EU production although world production remains at a record.  Argentina is lowered 1.5 million tons to 17.5 million with reductions in both area harvested and yield on continued widespread dry conditions.  EU production is raised 2.7 million tons to 134.8 million, mainly on higher government estimates from Poland and Germany.  Global consumption is reduced 0.9 million tons to 790.2 million on lower food, seed, and industrial use more than offsetting higher feed and residual use.  World trade is lowered 0.6 million tons to 208.3 million on reduced exports by the United States and Argentina more than offsetting higher EU exports.  Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are lowered 1.0 million tons to 267.5 million mostly on a reduction for the United States. ",

Supplies are reduced by 32 million bushels, on the combination of lower beginning stocks and production as indicated by the NASS Grains Stocks and Small Grains Annual Summary reports, respectively.  Partly offsetting are lower imports, with all the reduction for Durum.  Domestic use is raised 10 million bushels, all on higher feed and residual use.  The NASS Grain Stocks report indicated greater first quarter disappearance than previously estimated.  Exports remain at 975 million bushels due to offsetting by-class changes.  Projected ending stocks are reduced by 42 million bushels to 883 million, which would be the lowest ending stocks in six years.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.20 per bushel to $4.70 on reported NASS prices to date and expectations for futures and cash prices for the remainder of the marketing year. The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for larger supplies, increased consumption, greater exports, and higher stocks.  Supplies are raised 2.2 million tons to 1,072.5 million, mostly on Russia\u2019s production increasing 5.0 million tons to 83.0 million, which is the second-largest crop on record, following 2017/18.  The increased production is based on updated harvest results as reported by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, which imply record-high spring wheat yields.  Russia\u2019s increased production more than offsets reductions in Ukraine, Canada, Argentina, and the United States.  Ukraine\u2019s production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 25.5 million, based on Ukraine\u2019s State Statistics Service estimates.  Canada\u2019s production is reduced 1.0 million tons to 35.0 million, primarily on the updated Statistics Canada forecast issued September 14.  Argentina\u2019s production is lowered 0.5 million tons to 19.0 million on continued dry conditions in some regions.  World consumption is increased fractionally to 751.0 million tons, primarily on higher feed and residual usage for Russia and greater food, seed, and industrial use in Pakistan and EU more than offsetting lower feed and residual use for Ukraine and Canada.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 0.5 million tons to 189.9 million on higher exports for Russia more than offsetting reductions for Argentina and Ukraine.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised 1.5 million tons to 39.0 million, which are the second highest on record.  The largest import changes this month are for China and Pakistan, each raised 0.5 million tons.  China\u2019s imports are raised on a strong early pace and are now 7.5 million tons, making China the third largest global importer for 2020/21.  Pakistan imports are now 1.5 million tons, raising stocks which have been relatively tight recently.

Seed use is up 1 million bushels to 63 million, reflecting 2020/21 wheat planted area released today in the NASS Winter Wheat and Canola Seedings report.  Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are reduced 26 million bushels to 836 million, down 19 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.15 per bushel to $4.85 based on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for futures and cash prices for the remainder of the marketing year.The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for smaller supplies, increased consumption, higher exports, and reduced stocks.  Supplies are lowered 1.6 million tons to 1,072.7 million on reduced production in China and Argentina more than offsetting an increase for Russia.  China\u2019s production is reduced 1.8 million tons to 134.3 million on the National Bureau of Statistics estimate.  Russia\u2019s production is raised 1.3 million tons to a new record of 85.3 million, based on estimates from Russia\u2019s statistical agency Rosstat, surpassing the 2017/18 crop.  Argentina\u2019s production is reduced 0.5 million tons to 17.5 million on updated harvest results to date and this would be Argentina\u2019s smallest crop in five years.  World 2020/21 consumption is increased 1.8 million tons to 759.5 million, mostly on higher feed and residual use for China and the United States and greater food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use for Russia.  Continued high domestic corn prices in China are expected to result in further wheat feed use as projected 2020/21 wheat feed consumption is raised 1.0 million tons to 25.0 million, up 32 percent from last year.  Russia\u2019s FSI consumption is raised 500,000 tons to 23.5 million with greater supplies.Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised fractionally to 193.8 million tons on higher exports for Canada, the EU-27+UK, and India more than offsetting reductions for Russia and Argentina.  Russia\u2019s recently announced wheat export tax and grain export quota is expected to temper Russia\u2019s exports in the latter stages of the marketing year when it is imposed in mid-February.  Russia\u2019s exports are reduced 1.0 million tons to 39.0 million while EU-27+UK exports are raised 500,000 tons to 26.5 million as the EU-27+UK is expected to gain from Russia\u2019s export restraints.  Canada\u2019s exports are raised 500,000 tons to 26.5 million on a strong early export pace and the expectation of continued large shipments to China as its imports are also raised this month to 9.0 million.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 3.3 million tons to 313.2 million but remain record high with China and India holding 51 and 10 percent of the total, respectively. ",
    "April_2020": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. wheat is for lower exports, reduced domestic use, and increased ending stocks.  The NASS Grain Stocks report, issued March 31, implied less feed and residual disappearance for both the second and third quarters than previously estimated.  Total 2019/20 feed and residual use is trimmed 15 million bushels to 135 million.  Wheat exports are also cut 15 million bushels to 985 million on a slowing pace and prices that have become uncompetitive in many international import markets.  By class, Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter are reduced 10 million and 5 million bushels, respectively.  The changes result in a 30 million bushel increase in estimated all wheat ending stocks to 970 million.  Despite the larger ending stocks, the projected season-average farm price is raised $0.05 per bushel to $4.60 on updated NASS data as well as surging nearby cash and futures prices, partially resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.  The 2019/20 global outlook is for slightly higher supplies, but reduced trade and utilization.  Global production is lowered fractionally with several small mostly offsetting changes.  Global exports are lowered 0.9 million tons, led by a 1.5-million-ton reduction for Russia, which was directly offset by an equivalent increase for the EU.  The Russia change is based primarily on newly imposed government export restrictions.  The EU is raised on less competition from Russia as well as expectations of a continued strong pace of exports.  Several smaller export reductions are made; notably a 0.4-million-ton reduction for the United States and a 0.3-million-ton reduction for Pakistan.  Global imports are reduced 0.3 million tons each for Brazil, Japan, and Uzbekistan; a 0.3-million-ton increase for Morocco is partially offsetting.  Aggregate world consumption is lowered 5.1 million tons following updates to several countries.  The largest reductions are 2.0 million tons for China, 1.9 million for India, and 1.0 million for the EU.  With supplies higher and use down, projected 2019/20 global ending stocks are raised 5.6 million tons to a record high 292.8 million.  ",

Projected imports are lowered 20 million bushels to 160 million on pace to date.  Projected exports are lowered 25 million bushels to 900 million on increased competition from EU and the recent strengthening of the dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive.  Ending stocks are increased to 692 million bushels.  The season-average farm price is lowered 5 cents on the low end and 15 cents on the high end to $5.85 to $6.15 per bushel.  The reduction reflects prices received to date as well as a loss of competitiveness for U.S. wheat.  Global wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 3.3 million tons with both increased production and beginning stocks.  World wheat production remains record high and is raised 1.7 million tons led by 0.5-million-ton increases for both Argentina and Kazakhstan.  The Argentina change reflects harvest reports to date; Kazakhstan\u2019s increase is from updated government statistics.  Turkey is raised 0.3 million tons based on a multi-year review of production.  Ukraine is raised 0.3 million tons on updated government statistics.  Beginning stocks are raised 1.7 million tons mostly on back-year revisions to the Turkey production.  Global wheat trade for 2014/15 is raised with exports up 0.9 million tons on larger supplies and stronger demand.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons for EU and 0.5 million tons each for Argentina and Brazil.  The EU increase stems from a fast sales pace and competitive prices.  Argentina is raised on the larger crop, and Brazil is up on pace of shipments to date.  A 0.5-million-ton reduction for Australia is partly offsetting.  Egypt imports are raised 0.5 million tons; Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka are each raised 0.2 million tons.  Partly offsetting are 0.3-million-ton reductions each for Bangladesh, Brazil, and Turkey.  All the import changes reflect the pace of trade to date.  Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is up 1.5 million tons on both higher food and feed use. The largest increases for food use are for Egypt and Russia, up 0.5 million tons each.  Turkey feed use is up 0.4 million tons.  Partly offsetting are 0.5-million-ton and 0.3-million-ton reductions, respectively for Canada and Brazil feed use.

U.S. wheat production is raised 59 million bushels to 1,980 million on increased winter wheat and other spring wheat production as indicated by the NASS August Crop Production report.  Estimated food use for the 2018/19 market year is lowered 5 million bushels to 955 million based on the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report.  Food use for the 2019/20 market year is also lowered 5 million bushels to 960 million.  Feed and residual use is raised 20 million bushels to 170 million on greater wheat supplies and more competitive prices.  Projected 2019/20 U.S. wheat exports are raised 25 million bushels to 975 million on lower exportable supplies from key competitors, notably the EU, Kazakhstan, and Russia.  Ending stocks for 2019/20 are raised 14 million bushels to 1,014 million, down 5 percent from the previous year.  The season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per bushel to $5.00 on updated NASS prices, lower U.S. corn prices, and reduced wheat price expectations for the remainder of the market year.  Foreign 2019/20 wheat supplies are reduced 4.5 million tons, primarily on lower production in several major competing exporters.  The production declines are led by a 2.0-million-ton reduction for Turkey on both an updated harvested area estimate as well as a lower yield.  EU, Kazakhstan, and Russia are lowered 1.3 million tons, 1.0 million tons, and 1.2 million tons, respectively.  These reductions are based on harvest results confirming yield losses due to hot and dry June conditions in winter wheat regions and expanding dryness in the spring wheat areas of Russia and Kazakhstan.  Moldova production is also down 0.2 million tons.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton production increase for Argentina and a 0.2-million-ton increase for Ukraine.  Projected 2019/20 global exports are down 0.5 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for Kazakhstan and 0.5-million-ton reductions each for the EU and Russia, all on the smaller crops.  Partly offsetting is a 0.7-million-ton increase for the United States and 0.5-million-ton increases for both Argentina and Ukraine.  Projected 2019/20 world consumption is 2.0 million tons lower on both reduced feed and residual use and food and industrial consumption.

    "March_2022": "WHEAT:  The 2021/22 U.S. wheat supply and demand outlook is for lower supplies, unchanged domestic use, reduced exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lower because imports are reduced 5 million bushels, all for Hard Red Spring wheat, on a slower-than-expected pace.  Exports are reduced 10 million bushels, down to 800 million, on weaker than expected sales and shipments for Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are raised 5 million bushels to 653 million but are still 23 percent lower than last year.  The season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised $0.20 per bushel to $7.50 on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for cash and futures prices the remainder of the marketing year (MY).  Despite the recent sharp increases in futures and cash prices, a significant majority of U.S. wheat has already been marketed this MY, limiting the SAFP increase. The 2021/22 global outlook this month is for higher production, decreased trade and consumption, and larger ending stocks.  Global output is raised mainly on an increase for Australia, where an updated ABARES estimate raised production 2.3 million tons to a record 36.3 million.  World exports are lowered by 3.6 million tons to 203.1 million, as decreases for Ukraine and Russia are only partly offset by increases for Australia and India.  Exports are lowered for Ukraine by 4.0 million tons to 20.0 million, as the conflict in that country is expected to disrupt exports from the Black Sea region.  Russia exports are reduced 3.0 million tons to 32.0 million as vessel transportation is expected to be constrained by the conflict and the imposition of economic sanctions.  Partly offsetting these reductions are increases for 2021/22 Australian and Indian exports, up 2.0 and 1.5 million tons respectively to 27.5 and 8.5 million.  Increased production and competitive prices are expected to boost exports in Australia to a record level.  India\u2019s robust export pace is expected to continue because of its ample stocks and rising global prices.  Imports are lowered for many countries including Turkey, Egypt, the EU, Afghanistan, Algeria, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Yemen based on reduced Black Sea wheat export availability and higher world prices.  The 2021/22 global use forecast is lowered 0.8 million tons to 787.3 million, on slight decreases in many countries, including India, that more than offset increased feed and residual forecasts for Australia and Ukraine.  Global ending stocks are raised 3.3 million tons to 281.5 million, as increased stocks in Russia and Ukraine are only partly offset by declines in Turkey, India, and the EU.  ",

Projected exports for all wheat are unchanged, but minor adjustments are made by class with SRW wheat exports raised 5 million bushels and HRS wheat exports lowered an offsetting amount.  Projected ending stocks are raised 10 million bushels.  The 2013/14 projected season-average farm price is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $6.65 to $7.15 per bushel as near record world supplies and increased export competition reduce price prospects for U.S. wheat.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are raised 5.3 million tons to 887.3 million.  This is up 32.1 million tons from last year, but 9.0 million tons below the record supplies of 2011/12.  Global 2013/14 production is raised 5.0 million tons with most of the increase for Canada based on the latest Statistics Canada estimate which put production at a record 37.5 million tons.  This is up 4.3 million tons from last month\u2019s forecast and 5.4 million tons higher than the previous record in 1990/91 as excellent summer weather and an extended growing season boosted yields to record levels.  Production is also raised for Australia, up 1.0 million tons to 26.5 million, slightly above the recent forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences.  Production is also raised 0.4 million tons for 2012/13 reflecting recent revisions to last year\u2019s crop by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Partly offsetting this month\u2019s 2013/14 increases is a small reduction for the European Union as the latest statistical reports lower output for Denmark, but raise output slightly for the Netherlands and France.Global wheat trade for 2013/14 is raised this month with larger available supplies in key exporter countries and stronger demand expected for several importing countries.  Exports are raised 1.5 million tons for Canada, 1.0 million tons for the European Union, 0.5 million tons for Australia, and 0.2 million for Turkey.  Imports are raised for Egypt, Bangladesh, Mexico, Azerbaijan, South Korea, Syria, and Turkey.  Most of the increase in exportable supplies is from higher production in Canada and Australia; however, in the European Union higher corn imports and feeding are expected to free up wheat to support the strong ongoing pace of sales and shipments.  Wheat feeding is increased for Canada, Egypt, and South Korea.  Wheat food use is raised for Bangladesh and Syria.

Projected food use is increased by 5 million bushels to 970 million based on the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report.  This would be record food use, surpassing 2017/18, which was also revised higher.  Projected wheat exports are raised 50 million bushels to 1,025 million on substantially lower exportable supplies for the EU and limited additional export capacity of several other major competitors.

The projected season-average farm price is up $0.10 per bushel at the midpoint with the range at $4.60 to $5.60.  World 2018/19 wheat supplies are reduced this month by 7.1 million tons, primarily on lower EU production.  Continued drought conditions in several northern European countries, most notably Germany, resulted in lower production, down 7.5 million tons to 137.5 million.  This would be the lowest EU wheat production since 2012/13.  Russia\u2019s wheat production is increased 1.0 million tons to 68.0 million on continued favorable conditions for spring wheat.   Projected global 2018/19 trade is lower, mainly on reduced EU exports, which are down 4.5 million tons to 23.0 million, the lowest in six years.  Russia\u2019s exports are increased 1.0 million tons to 35.0 million; Russia is projected to remain the leading world wheat exporter for the second consecutive year.  Global imports are lowered for several countries with the largest reduction for Algeria.  Projected 2018/19 world consumption is 5.1 million tons lower, primarily on reduced feed use in the EU and Russia.

    "February_2014": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 50 million bushels lower as higher expected food use and exports more than offset an increase in projected imports.  Imports are raised 10 million bushels as railroad backlogs and other logistical problems slow Canadian wheat shipments to Pacific Coast terminals and encourage additional shipments of Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat into the U.S. market.  Projected food use is increased 10 million bushels based on the latest flour production data reported by the North American Millers\u2019 Association.  Food use increases are projected for Hard Red Winter and HRS wheat.  Exports are projected 50 million bushels higher as reduced competition from Argentina and strong sales and shipments further boost prospects for U.S. wheat in world trade.  A reduction in expected exports from Australia during the July-June world trade year also raises prospects for 2013/14 U.S. shipments.  Exports are projected higher for all classes except Durum.  The season-average farm price for all wheat is narrowed 5 cents on both ends of the projected range to $6.65 to $6.95 per bushel.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are lowered 1.1 million tons with lower beginning stocks for Argentina and Russia and a 0.8-million-ton reduction in world production.  Small reductions in 2012/13 production for Argentina and imports for Russia reduce world carryin supplies for 2013/14.  Kazakhstan production for 2013/14 is lowered 1.6 million tons based on the latest official estimates which raised harvested area, but lowered the yield sharply from indications based on earlier harvest reports.  Production for Algeria is lowered 0.3 million tons based on the latest official data.  Partly offsetting these reductions is a 0.6-million-ton increase for Brazil where better-than-expected yields in southern wheat areas more than offset earlier freeze damage farther north.  Ukraine production is also raised, up 0.3 million tons, on final government estimates.Foreign wheat exports for 2013/14 are lowered as reductions for Kazakhstan and Argentina more than offset an increase for the European Union.  Kazakhstan exports are lowered 1.5 million tons with the smaller crop.  Exports are lowered 1.0 million tons for Argentina based on the slow pace of shipments.  European Union exports are raised 1.5 million tons reflecting the rapid pace of shipments and licensing.  Wheat feeding is lowered for the European Union as increased corn imports and feeding free up wheat for export.  Wheat feed use is lowered 0.2 million tons for South Korea as increased corn imports and feeding also displace wheat in that market.  Global wheat ending stocks are projected 1.7 million tons lower with the largest declines for the United States and European Union.  Smaller reductions in ending stocks are expected for Algeria and Russia.  Partly offsetting are stocks increases for Argentina, Brazil, and Ukraine.  ",
    "April_2021": "WHEAT:  This month\u2019s supply and demand outlook for 2020/21 U.S. wheat is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use, unchanged exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered with a reduction in projected imports by 10 million bushels to 110 million on a lower than expected import pace with decreases in Durum and Hard Red Spring.  Domestic consumption is reduced primarily on less implied feed and residual use as well as a small reduction in seed use.  The NASS Grain Stocks report, issued March 31, indicated less feed and residual disappearance for both the second and third quarters.  As a result, annual 2020/21 feed and residual use is lowered 25 million bushels to 100 million.  Exports are unchanged this month, but there are offsetting by-class changes for White and Hard Red Winter exports.  Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are raised to 852 million bushels but are still 17 percent below last year.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $5.00 per bushel.The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for slightly smaller supplies, increased consumption, higher exports, and reduced stocks this month.  Supplies are lowered 0.5 million tons to 1,076.5 million but 2020/21 production remains at a record 776.5 million.  World 2020/21 consumption is increased 5.1 million tons to 781.0 million, mainly on higher feed and residual use for China.  Auction sales of China\u2019s old-crop wheat stocks continue to be large and domestic corn prices in China remain at a premium to wheat.  This is expected to further increase China\u2019s 2020/21 wheat feed and residual use, raised 5.0 million tons to a record 40.0 million. Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 1.2 million tons to a record 198.9 million, mostly on higher exports by Russia and the EU-27+UK.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised 0.5 million to 39.5 million despite the recent imposition of an export tax.  Russia\u2019s monthly exports continue to be large and its prices remain competitive internationally.

Seed use is down 1 million bushels reflecting 2020/21 wheat planted area released today in the NASS Winter Wheat and Canola Seedings report.  Ending stocks are now projected at 965 million bushels, down 9 million from the previous report.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $4.55 per bushel.  Foreign production for the 2019/20 market year is dropped 1.0 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for Russia on updated government production data, and a 0.5-million-ton decrease for Australia reflecting the severe drought conditions in parts of the country.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton increase for the European Union.  Foreign consumption is raised fractionally, and global exports are raised 1.3 million tons.  The export increase is led by a 2.0-million-ton increase for the EU on improved price competitiveness and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine on pace to date.  Partly offsetting is a 1.0-million-ton decrease for Russia reflecting lower supplies and higher relative prices.

Supplies are reduced primarily on lower production from the NASS Small Grains Summary, issued September 30.  Supplies are also lowered on reduced imports, down 10 million bushels, to 125 million on the import pace.  Annual feed and residual use is lowered 25 million bushels to 135 million despite the NASS Grain Stocks report indicating greater disappearance in the first quarter compared to last year.  Significantly reduced supplies of Hard Red Spring, Durum, and White wheat for 2021/22 are expected to curtail feed and residual use for the remainder of 2021/22 along with the continued large price premium of wheat over corn.  Exports are unchanged at 875 million bushels but there are offsetting by-class changes.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are reduced 35 million bushels to 580 million, which are the lowest U.S. ending stocks since 2007/08.  The projected 2021/22 season-average farm price is raised $0.10 per bushel to $6.70 on reported NASS prices to date and price expectations for the remainder of 2021/22.The global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for reduced supplies, lower consumption, nearly unchanged trade, and smaller ending stocks.  Supplies are projected falling by 8.6 million tons to 1,064.2 million, primarily on the combination of reduced beginning stocks for Iran and reduced production for Canada, Iran, and the United States.  Iran\u2019s 2021/22 beginning stocks are lowered 3.6 million, the result of a multi-year production revision from 2017/18 onward.  Iran\u2019s 2021/22 production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 13.5 million, based on indications of greater 2021/22 imports driven by reduced domestic supplies.  Canada\u2019s production is reduced 2.0 million tons to 21.0 million on reduced harvested area as increased abandonment is expected from the severe drought affecting the Prairie Provinces this past summer.  Projected 2021/22 world consumption is lowered 2.6 million tons to 787.1 million with the majority of the reduction for food, seed, and industrial use in India and Canada and feed and residual use for the United States.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is fractionally lower at 199.6 million tons on lower exports by Canada that are nearly offset by higher exports by Australia, the EU, and India.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are reduced 6.0 million tons to 277.2 million and are the lowest since 2016/17 with Iran, the United States, and Australia accounting for most of the reduction.

Projected imports are lowered 15 million bushels to 120 million on a slow pace to date.  The NASS Grain Stocks report raised 2018/19 ending stocks 8 million bushels and estimated first quarter 2019/20 stocks at 2,385 million bushels, down fractionally from the previous year.  These stocks imply first quarter feed and residual use is similar to last year.  Annual 2019/20 feed and residual use is lowered 30 million bushels to 140 million but remain above last year\u2019s revised 89.8 million.  Wheat exports are lowered 25 million bushels to 950 million on reduced competitiveness in international markets.  Ending stocks are projected at 1,043 million bushels, up 29 million from the previous month, and the season-average farm price is lowered $0.10 per bushel to $4.70.  Global 2019/20 wheat supplies are raised fractionally with decreased production offset by higher beginning stocks.  World production is lowered 0.3 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton cut to Australia\u2019s crop on further drought effects.  The United States is lowered 0.5 million tons, and Canada and Serbia are each reduced 0.3 million tons.  Partly offsetting are production increases of 1.0 million tons for the EU and 0.7 million tons for Turkmenistan, both on updated harvest reports.  Projected global exports for 2019/20 are lowered 1.2 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for Australia reflecting their smaller crop.  Total imports are decreased 1.1 million tons with the United States, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Kyrgyzstan accounting for most of the decline.  World wheat consumption is reduced 1.1 million tons primarily on a 0.8-million-ton reduction in U.S. feed and residual use.

Wheat feed and residual use for 2017/18 is lowered 20 million bushels and reflects disappearance for June - November as indicated by the December 1 and revised September 1 stocks released in the NASS Grain Stocks report.  All wheat exports are unchanged at 975 million bushels; however, a 10 million bushel decrease in Hard Red Spring exports is offset by 5-million-bushel increases each for Soft Red Winter and White wheat.  Total supplies are raised 5 million bushels on higher imports while production and the season-average farm price are unchanged. Global wheat supplies for 2017/18 are lowered 0.8 million tons on reduced beginning stocks, more than offsetting increased production.  World beginning stocks are lowered 2.6 million tons mostly on a large 2016/17 production cut for Australia, reflecting updated Australia Bureau of Statistics data.  World production for 2017/18 is raised 1.8 million tons led by a 2.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.8-million-ton increased for Pakistan.  Partially offsetting is a 0.9-million-ton reduction for the EU.  All these production changes reflect updated government data.  Global exports are lowered 1.3 million tons led by reductions for Australia and the EU that reflect decreased supplies and increase market competition.  Russian exports, in contrast, are raised 1.5 million tons to a record 35.0 million on increased supplies and competitive prices.

Total 2018/19 feed and residual use is lowered 10 million bushels to 70 million.  Wheat exports are lowered 20 million bushels to 945 million on a continued sluggish export pace.  By class, Hard Red Winter exports are raised 10 million bushels, which is offset by reductions of 15 million for Hard Red Spring, 10 million for White, and 5 million for Durum.  These demand changes, as well as a small reduction in seed use, led to a 31.5-million-bushel-increase in ending stocks, which are now projected at 1,087 million bushels.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.05 per bushel at the midpoint to $5.20 based on updated NASS price and marketing data.  World 2018/19 wheat supplies are raised 2.1 million tons due mainly to increased beginning stocks that largely reflect multi-year revisions for Iran.  Global production and exports are each reduced fractionally, but domestic consumption is lowered 2.9 million tons.  The consumption change stems primarily from lower Iran and EU feed and residual use; Iran is lowered on the series revision and the EU reduction is based on more competitive corn prices and increased coarse grain disappearance.

This reduction is primarily attributed to heightened Canadian competition expected from its increased exportable supplies.  Canada and the United States compete in several of the same markets in Latin America and East Asia.  No other supply or use categories are revised this month.  Based on NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the rest of the marketing year, the projected 2017/18 season-average farm price (SAFP) is unchanged at the midpoint of $4.60 per bushel.  However, the SAFP is narrowed by 10 cents at both ends of the range to $4.50 to $4.70. Global 2017/18 wheat supplies are increased, primarily on higher production forecasts for Canada and the European Union more than offsetting production declines in Brazil, South Africa, and Yemen.  Canadian wheat production is raised 3.0 million tons to 30.0 million, largely on increased yields in the Prairie Provinces as reported in Statistics Canada\u2019s Production of Principal Field Crops report, released on December 6.  EU wheat production is raised 1.0 million tons to 152.5 million, mainly on higher production in Romania, Poland, Latvia, and Bulgaria.World 2017/18 trade is greater this month as higher exports from Canada, Russia, and Ukraine more than offset reduced U.S. exports.  Projected imports are increased for Indonesia, China and Brazil.  Indonesia\u2019s imports are raised 1.0 million tons to 11.5 million, primarily on higher expected feed wheat usage.

The marketing year average price received by producers is unchanged at the midpoint, but the range is narrowed $0.20 per bushel to $3.60 to $3.80.  Global wheat production for 2016/17 is raised 6.5 million tons led by a 4.7-million-ton increase for Australia, a 0.9-million-ton increase for China, and 0.4-million-ton increases for both the EU and Brazil.  Higher area estimated by ABARES combined with a USDA yield projection that reflects near ideal weather support the large Australia production increase.  Prior to this change, USDA had already projected a record Australia yield.  However, the new yield is up 18 percent from the previous record.  Production increases for China, the EU, and Brazil are due to updated official data.  Global exports are increased 2.6 million tons.  Australia exports are raised 3.5 million tons reflecting the large crop.  Russia exports are lowered 1.0 million tons due to a slower-than-expected pace.

The NASS Crop Production report forecast all wheat production at 1,697 million bushels, down 49 million from the previous forecast.  Most of the reduction is in Hard Red Winter and Soft White Winter.  The all wheat yield is forecast at 44.5 bushels per acre, down 1.3 bushels from the previous forecast.  Feed and residual use is lowered 10 million bushels to 160 million on reduced supplies.  Food use for both 2020/21 and 2021/22 is reduced slightly, based primarily on the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report.  Wheat exports are unchanged but there are offsetting by-class export changes for several classes.

Supplies are projected to decline 16.8 million tons to 1,065.7 million, primarily on lower production for Russia, Canada, and the United States.  Russia\u2019s production is reduced 12.5 million tons to 72.5 million on decreased winter wheat production, which is only slightly offset by higher spring wheat output.  Winter wheat harvested area is reduced on updated area data from Rosstat, Russia\u2019s statistical agency, while yield is lowered on harvest results reported by the Ministry of Agriculture.  A series of thawing and refreezing events during February and March, referred to as \u201cice crusting,\u201d resulted in reductions for both area harvested and yield for Russia\u2019s winter wheat.  Canada\u2019s production is lowered 7.5 million tons to 24.0 million on worsening drought conditions across the Prairie Provinces during July.  This would be the smallest Canadian wheat crop since 2010/11.  Partially offsetting these reductions are production increases for Ukraine and Australia.  Ukraine is raised to a record 33.0 million tons on increased area as reported by its State Statistical Service and a higher yield on harvest results to date.  Australia is increased 1.5 million tons to 30.0 million as continued abundant precipitation has benefited crop conditions.Projected 2021/22 world consumption is reduced by 4.2 million tons to 786.7 million.   Most of the consumption decreases are for feed and residual use with the curtailed supplies in Russia and Canada.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is lowered 5.8 million tons to 198.2 million on reduced exports for Canada and Russia only partially offset by higher exports by Ukraine, Australia, and the EU.  The reduction in aggregate exportable supplies from major exporters resulted in decreased imports from several countries including Afghanistan and Algeria, while larger crops in Brazil and Morocco reduce import demand there.

All wheat production for 2022/23 is projected at 1,729 million bushels, up 83 million from last year, as higher yields more than offset a slight decrease in harvested area. The all wheat yield, projected at 46.6 bushels per acre, is up 2.3 bushels from last year. The first survey-based forecast for 2022/23 winter wheat production is down 8 percent from last year as lower Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter production more than offset an increase in White Wheat production. Abandonment for Winter Wheat is the highest since 2002 with the highest levels in Texas and Oklahoma.  Spring Wheat production for 2022/23 is projected to rebound significantly from last year\u2019s drought-reduced Hard Red Spring and Durum crops primarily on return-to-trend yields. Total 2022/23 domestic use is projected down 1 percent on lower feed and residual use more than offsetting higher food use.

Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are 6 percent lower than last year at 619 million bushels, the lowest level in nine years. The projected 2022/23 season-average farm price (SAFP) is a record $10.75 per bushel, up $3.05 from last year\u2019s revised SAFP. Wheat cash and futures prices are expected to remain sharply elevated through the first part of the marketing year when the largest proportion of U.S. wheat is marketed.The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 is for lower supplies and consumption, increased trade, and lower ending stocks.  Global production is forecast at 774.8 million tons, 4.5 million lower than in 2021/22.  Reduced production in Ukraine, Australia, and Morocco is only partly offset by increases in Canada, Russia, and the United States.  Production in Ukraine is forecast at 21.5 million tons in 2022/23, 11.5 million lower than 2021/22 due to the ongoing war. Canada\u2019s production is forecast to rebound to 33.0 million tons in 2022/23, up significantly from last year\u2019s drought-affected crop.  Projected 2022/23 world use is slightly lower at 787.5 million tons, as increases for food use are more than offset by declining feed and residual use. The largest feed and residual use reductions are in China, the European Union, and Australia as well as a sizeable decline in food use in India.Projected 2022/23 global trade is a record 204.9 million tons, up 5.0 million from last year.  Imports are projected to rise on increased exportable supplies from Russia and Canada more than offsetting reductions for Ukraine and Australia.  Russia is projected as the leading 2022/23 wheat exporter at 39.0 million tons, followed by the European Union, Australia, Canada, and the United States.  Ukraine\u2019s 2022/23 export forecast is 10.0 million tons, down sharply from last year on reduced production and significant logistical constraints for exports. India is expected to remain a significant wheat exporter in 2022/23.  Projected 2022/23 world ending stocks are reduced 5 percent to 267.0 million tons and would be the lowest level in six years.

World 2017/18 wheat supplies increased this month by nearly 3.0 million tons as production is raised to a new record of 759.8 million, mainly on Morocco\u2019s higher production estimate as it recovered from a severe drought in 2016/17.  Global supplies also increased with a multi-year reduction in Iran\u2019s food, seed, and industrial use, which raised carry-in stocks by nearly 2.0 million tons. Projected global 2017/18 trade is virtually unchanged on increased exports from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Argentina nearly offsetting lower exports from the EU and other exporters.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised 1.0 million tons to 38.5 million, which surpasses last year\u2019s record exports by more than 10 million.

The 2020/21 U.S. wheat crop is projected at 1,866 million bushels, down 3 percent from last year on lower yields offsetting higher harvested acreage.  The all-wheat yield is projected at 49.5 bushels per acre, down 2.2 bushels from last year.  The first 2020 NASS survey-based winter wheat production forecast of 1,255 million bushels is down 4 percent from 2019, on lower Hard Red Winter and White Winter production.  Total 2020/21 domestic use is projected down nearly 3 percent on reduced feed and residual use as record-large 2020/21 corn supplies are expected to displace wheat for feeding.  Higher food use is partially offsetting as 2020/21 is projected up 2 million bushels to 964 million, up from a revised 2019/20 estimate of 962 million, which was raised 7 million this month.

Exports for 2020/21 are projected at 950 million bushels, down 20 million from the revised 2019/20 exports.  Greater global 2020/21 export competition is expected for the United States with several major exporters projected having larger supplies.  Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are 69 million bushels lower than last year at 909 million.  The projected season-average farm price is $4.60 per bushel, unchanged from last year as the outlook for low U.S. corn prices is expected to restrain 2020/21 U.S. wheat prices. The initial outlook for 2020/21 international wheat is for larger supplies, increased trade, greater consumption, and higher ending stocks.  Foreign supplies are projected to increase 23.2 million tons to 982.4 million as several major exporters (Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Russia) are projected to have higher production for 2020/21.  Australia is projected with the largest increase from last year to 24.0 million tons, up 8.8 million as it recovers from a multi-year drought.  Conversely, the EU is projected to decline nearly 12 million tons to 143 0 million on lower harvested area and yields.  Ukraine production is also projected lower at 28.0 million tons, but this would still be the second-largest production on record.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is 4.6 million tons, or more than 2 percent higher, at a record-high 188.0 million on greater exportable supplies.  Imports are projected to rise, primarily on increased demand by China, Algeria, Morocco, the EU, Iraq, and Uzbekistan.  Russia is projected as the 2020/21 leading world wheat exporter at 35.0 million tons with Argentina, Australia, and Canada also projected higher while the EU, Ukraine, and United States are lower.  Projected 2020/21 world consumption is increased 4.9 million tons to a record-large 753.5 million as higher food, seed, and industrial use more than offsets reduced feed use on greater global corn supplies.

Feed and residual use is projected 25 million bushels higher as weaker cash prices relative to corn support opportunities for increased wheat use in livestock and poultry rations.  Feed and residual use is raised 10 million bushels each for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Soft Red Winter (SRW) wheat, and raised 5 million bushels for White wheat.  Projected all-wheat exports are unchanged, but HRW and Hard Red Spring wheat are lowered 25 million bushels and 5 million bushels, respectively.  Offsetting these reductions are projected increases in SRW and White wheat exports of 25 million bushels and 5 million bushels, respectively.  By-class export changes largely reflect the pace of sales and shipments to date.  The projected season-average farm price for wheat is narrowed 5 cents on both ends of the range to $7.70 to $8.10 per bushel.Global wheat supplies for 2012/13 are nearly unchanged with a small increase in beginning stocks more than offsetting a small decrease in production.  Global wheat output is projected 0.7 million tons lower.  Production is lowered for Kazakhstan and Brazil, but raised for Ukraine, South Africa, and Belarus.Global wheat trade for 2012/13 is trimmed slightly.  Imports are lowered 0.5 million tons for Morocco, 0.3 million tons for Saudi Arabia, and 0.2 million tons each for Israel, South Africa, and Vietnam.  Imports are raised 0.6 million tons for South Korea, 0.5 million tons for Iran, and 0.2 million tons for Brazil.  Exports are raised 0.5 million tons for EU-27, but reduced 0.5 million tons for Kazakhstan and 0.3 million tons for Brazil.  Lower exports for Brazil and Kazakhstan reflect smaller crops, while the increase in South Korea imports supports higher wheat feeding.  Wheat feed and residual use is also raised for Ukraine.  Wheat feed and residual use is lowered for EU-27, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, and Israel.  Global wheat consumption is virtually unchanged at 673.4 million tons; however, global consumption is projected down 24.6 million tons year to year, mostly reflecting lower feed and residual use in 2012/13.

    "December_2014": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 10 million bushels this month with higher projected imports.  Increased production and higher imports from Canada are expected to add to U.S. wheat supplies.  The entire import increase is for Durum.  Domestic use projections and wheat exports are unchanged.  However, a 15-million-bushel reduction for Hard Red Winter exports is offset by 5-million-bushel increases for Hard Red Spring, White, and Durum.  Ending stocks for all wheat are projected 10 million bushels higher with the supply increase.  The projected season-average farm price range is raised 10 cents per bushel at the midpoint to $5.80 to $6.20 per bushel on prices reported to date and recently higher cash and futures prices.  Global wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 1.9 million tons with increased production offsetting lower beginning stocks.  World wheat production remains record high and is raised 2.3 million tons led by a 1.8-million-ton increase for Canada.  Kazakhstan is raised 0.5 million tons.  Both production increases are from updated government statistics.  Partly offsetting is a 0.4-million-ton reduction for global beginning stocks with Indonesia consumption raised for 2012/13 and 2013/14.  Global wheat trade for 2014/15 is raised with exports up 3.1 million tons on larger supplies and stronger demand in several importing countries.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons for EU, and 0.5 million tons each for Canada, Iran, and Kazakhstan.  The EU increase stems from competitive prices and a fast sales pace to date.  The Canada and Kazakhstan increases reflect larger crops.  Iran exports are raised on larger flour exports to nearby countries.  Russia exports are lowered 0.5 million tons on increased competition, particularly from EU.  Iran imports are raised 1.0 million tons on a fast pace of shipments from EU.  Egypt imports are raised 0.5 million tons on increasing purchases from the private sector.  Smaller increases are made for Bangladesh, Jordan, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Uzbekistan.  Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is down slightly.  The biggest change is a 1.5-million-ton decrease in EU wheat feeding on larger coarse grain supplies and higher wheat exports.  Canada wheat feeding is raised 0.5 million tons on the larger crop.  Global ending stocks are projected 2.0 million tons higher mostly on increases for Canada, EU, and Russia.",

Supplies are increased by 5 million bushels on higher imports.  Wheat exports are lowered 35 million bushels to 965 million with reductions in Hard Red Spring and White on stronger than expected export competition for these classes.  Wheat food use is reduced by 5 million bushels to 965 million, based primarily on the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report.  Wheat ground for flour was lower in the first half of the 2018/19 Marketing Year than previously forecast.  Projected 2018/19 ending stocks are raised 45 million bushels to 1,055 million.  The season-average farm price range is unchanged at the midpoint of $5.15 per bushel and the range is narrowed to $5.10 to $5.20.   Global wheat supplies are reduced, primarily on lower production forecasts for Kazakhstan and Iraq.  Projected 2018/19 world trade is fractionally higher as larger EU and Brazil exports more than offset reductions for the United States and Mexico.  The EU is increased 1.0 million tons to 23.0 million as its recent improved export competiveness is expected to continue for the remainder of the trade year.  Global imports are raised for Algeria, Morocco, and the Philippines while decreased for Bangladesh, the EU, Mexico, and Venezuela.  Projected 2018/19 world consumption is reduced 5.1 million tons with India accounting for 3.0 million of the decrease as its total wheat consumption is lowered to 95.0 million, compared to last year\u2019s 95.8 million.  This reduction is based on an upward revision to the official Indian government wheat stocks estimate for 2018/19.  Global ending stocks are increased 3.0 million tons to 270.5 million, down 3 percent from last year\u2019s record.   ",
    "March_2018": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat exports for 2017/18 are reduced 25 million bushels to 925 million, while ending stocks are raised by the same amount.  Exports are lowered on reduced price competitiveness in some international markets.  Hard red winter wheat and hard red spring wheat exports are reduced 15 million bushels and 10 million bushels, respectively.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.05 per bushel at the midpoint of the range to $4.65 on NASS prices reported to date and expectations of higher cash prices for the remainder of the marketing year, reflecting the ongoing drought in the Southern Plains.  Global 2017/18 wheat supplies increased 0.5 million tons, primarily on a higher production forecast for Kazakhstan.  World exports are raised fractionally with Russia increased 1.5 million tons, partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for the EU.  Russia exports are now projected at 37.5 million tons, up 35 percent from the previous year\u2019s record and surpassing EU exports by 12.5 million.  Global imports are also raised, led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Turkey, which is largely attributed to supplies from Russia.  Total world consumption is reduced, primarily on a 2.0-million-ton reduction for India on reports of weakening demand from rising domestic prices.  Despite the reduction, total India consumption is still up marginally from the previous year\u2019s record.

Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 2.3 million tons primarily on increased production but also higher beginning stocks.  World wheat production remains record high and is raised 1.9 million tons to 734.9 million.  The primary production change is for Canada, which is raised 1.6 million tons to 27.6 million on a Statistics Canada report.  Global wheat trade for 2015/16 is raised with exports up 1.3 million tons on larger supplies, expected policy changes in Argentina, and stronger demand in several importing countries. Exports are raised 1.0 million tons for Argentina, and 0.5 million tons each for Canada and Ukraine.  The Argentina change is based on the expectation that the new government will reduce export restrictions.  The Canada change is on a larger crop as well as a strong pace to date.  The Ukraine change is also on a fast pace as well as strong feed wheat demand in Southeast Asia.  Partially offsetting is a 1.0-million-ton reduction for EU exports on a slow pace of licenses and competition, especially from Black Sea origins.  The largest import increases are 0.4 million tons for Ethiopia on expectations of additional tenders in response to emergency food needs, and 0.3 million tons each for Indonesia and Thailand on increased feed wheat purchases.  Total world wheat consumption for 2015/16 is down 0.2 million tons.  The biggest change is a 1.0-million-ton decrease in EU wheat feeding that is mostly offset by increased consumption in several other countries, notably 0.3 million-ton-increases each for Indonesia and Thailand feeding.

Supplies are raised on higher production with all wheat production forecast at 1,783 million bushels, up 2 million from last month.  Reductions in winter wheat and Durum are more than offset by an increase in Other Spring Wheat.  The all wheat yield is 47.5 bushels per acre, up 0.2 bushels from last month.  Food use is raised 6 million bushels to 970 million, based primarily on the NASS Flour Milling Products report, issued August 1.  The report indicated record wheat flour millings in the April-June quarter, which resulted in raising 2021/22 food use to a record 972 million bushels.  Wheat exports for 2022/23 are increased 25 million bushels to 825 million with most of the upward adjustment for Soft Red Winter and White, based on competitive export prices.  Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are lowered 29 million bushels to 610 million.  The projected 2022/23 season-average farm price (SAFP) is reduced $1.25 per bushel to $9.25.  This is based on prices received for marketings to date, which are lower than previously expected.  However, the SAFP is still projected at a record, surpassing $7.77 per bushel in 2012/13.  The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 is for higher supplies, greater consumption, increased trade, and fractionally lower stocks.  Supplies are raised by 4.2 million tons to 1,055.9 million as higher production more than offsets reduced beginning stocks.  Production is increased to a record 779.6 million tons, primarily on higher production for Russia, Australia, and China.  Russia\u2019s production is raised 6.5 million tons to a record 88.0 million on both higher harvested area and yield.  Harvested area increased for both winter and spring wheat on updated area data from Rosstat, Russia\u2019s statistical agency.  Winter wheat yields are raised on harvest results while spring wheat yields increased on generally favorable conditions to date.  Australia\u2019s production is raised 3.0 million tons to 33.0 million as increasingly favorable weather conditions indicate higher yield prospects.  China\u2019s production is increased 3.0 million tons to 138.0 million tons on the National Bureau of Statistics summer grain report, primarily on higher harvested area.  Partially offsetting these increases are reductions for India and the EU.  India\u2019s production is lowered 3.0 million tons to 103.0 million, primarily on reduced harvested area.  EU production is reduced 2.0 million tons to 132.1 million, mostly on reductions for Hungary, Spain, and Romania.  Projected 2022/23 world consumption is raised 4.4 million tons to 788.6 million, led by higher feed and residual use for Russia and Australia.  Projected 2022/23 global trade is raised 3.2 million tons to 208.6 million on higher exports by Russia, Australia, Ukraine, Canada, and the United States more than offsetting lower exports from the EU and Argentina.  Russia\u2019s exports are raised to a record 42.0 million tons on greater exportable supplies and expectations that export prices will remain competitive.

Supplies are projected down 3 percent from 2020/21 on lower carry-in stocks offsetting higher production and imports.  All wheat production is projected at 1,872 million bushels, up 3 percent from last year on higher harvested acreage and yields.  The all wheat yield is projected at 50.0 bushels per acre, up 0.3 bushels.  The first 2021 NASS survey-based winter wheat production forecast of 1,283 million bushels is up 10 percent from 2020, on increased Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter production more than offsetting lower White Winter production.  Total 2021/22 domestic use is projected 6 percent higher on higher feed and residual and food use.  A reduced wheat-corn price spread is expected to raise wheat feeding in the June-August quarter with annual feed and residual use projected at 170 million bushels, the highest since 2013/14.  Food use is projected modestly higher at 963 million bushels, up 3 million from a revised 2020/21 estimate of 960 million.  Exports are projected at 900 million bushels, down 65 million from the revised 2020/21 exports.  Several major exporters are projected to have larger supplies in 2021/22 and relatively high U.S. prices are expected to reduce U.S. competitiveness.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are 11 percent lower than last year at 774 million bushels, the lowest level in seven years.  The projected 2021/22 season-average farm price is $6.50 per bushel, up $1.45 from last year\u2019s revised price on reduced stocks and significantly higher U.S. corn prices.  The initial global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for larger supplies, higher consumption, increased trade, and marginally higher stocks.  Supplies are projected to increase 8.1 million tons to 1,083.7 million with production projected at a record 789.0 million tons.  Higher production for Argentina, the EU, UK, Morocco, Ukraine, and the United States is expected to more than offset reductions for Australia and Canada.  Russia\u2019s production of 85.0 million tons is similar to last year\u2019s record on increased winter wheat area.  Projected 2021/22 world consumption is raised 7.8 million tons to a record 788.7 million, primarily on higher food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use, continuing a long-term uptrend.  Wheat feed and residual use is projected up relatively less than FSI as increases in the EU, UK, Russia, and the United States are partially offset by decreased feed use for China, Canada, and Australia.Projected 2021/22 global trade is a record 202.4 million tons, up 2.8 million from last year on increased exportable supplies.  Imports are projected to rise, primarily on increased demand from Algeria, Indonesia, the EU, and Middle East region.  China\u2019s imports are projected slightly lower at 10.0 million tons but remain large with stocks continuing to decline despite higher production.  Imports are also projected lower for Pakistan and Morocco on increased supplies.  Russia is projected as the leading 2021/22 wheat exporter at 40.0 million tons.  Argentina, the EU, and Ukraine exports are also projected higher while Australia, Canada, and the United States are lower.

Production for 2016/17 is lowered 11 million bushels based on the latest estimate from the NASS September 30 Small Grains Annual Summary.  Feed and residual use is reduced 70 million bushels to 260 million reflecting the September 1 stocks that indicated lower-than-expected June-August disappearance.  Exports are raised 25 million bushels on increased competitiveness of U.S. wheat particularly in North Africa where the EU has lost some market share because of lower production and quality problems.  The marketing year average price received by producers is raised $0.10 per bushel at the midpoint to a range of $3.50 to $3.90 on higher-than-expected NASS prices to date.  Global wheat supplies for 2016/17 are lowered 1.6 million tons on a 0.4-million-ton production decrease and lower beginning stocks.  A 2.0-million-ton production decline for the EU is partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Canada and a 0.8-million-ton increase for Australia.  The Australia increase is attributed to continued excellent growing conditions, and yields are projected to be record high.  Global exports are raised 1.9 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Australia, a 0.7-million-ton increase for the United States, and 0.5-million-ton increases each for Canada and Ukraine.  Global export gains are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton decrease for the EU on the projected supply reduction.  Global use for 2016/17 is down 1.0 million tons led by reductions in feed use for the United States and the EU.

The largest increases are for Argentina, Russia, and the EU.  Global exports are raised 1.2 million tons led by increases for Argentina, Australia, and the EU.  Partly offsetting is a reduction in Canadian exports reflecting the slow shipment pace so far this year.  Global use for 2016/17 is raised 0.1 million tons with increased food use partially offset by a reduction in feed and residual use.

U.S. wheat exports for 2013/14 are raised 25 million bushels reflecting continued strong early season sales and an increased outlook for China imports.  Despite larger expected crops in several major exporting countries, strong early season demand and higher projected world imports and consumption also boost prospects for U.S. shipments.  Ending stocks are projected 25 million bushels lower.  The projected range for the 2013/14 season-average farm price is lowered 10 cents per bushel at the midpoint to $6.40 to $7.60 per bushel.

Production is raised 2.8 million tons for the European Union with the biggest increases for Spain, France, and Germany, and smaller increases for Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.  Production is raised 2.5 million tons for Kazakhstan where abundant spring and summer rainfall is supporting prospects for strong yields, much as in the adjoining spring wheat areas of Russia.  Ukraine production is raised 2.0 million tons based on the latest harvest results.  Production is raised 0.5 million tons for Canada as favorable soil moisture and a lack of heat stress across the western Prairies support higher yield prospects.  India production is raised 0.5 million tons based on the latest government assessment.  Turkey production is raised 0.4 million tons for wheat reflecting a favorable growing season throughout the region.  Partly offsetting this month\u2019s production increases are reductions in South America where crops will not be harvested until late 2013.  Production is lowered 1.0 million tons for Argentina based on lower reported seedings.  Brazil production is lowered 0.3 million tons reflecting the late July freeze event that appears to have damaged developing wheat in limited areas of southern Brazil. Global wheat consumption for 2013/14 is raised 6.9 million tons with increases in wheat feeding projected for a number of countries and higher food use expected for India and Iran.

The projected season-average farm price range is narrowed 5 cents on both the high and low ends to $5.90 to $6.10 per bushel.  Global wheat supplies for 2014/15 are lowered fractionally due mainly to reduced Brazil production, which is partially offset by a larger Belarus crop.  Both changes are made on updated government statistics.  Global wheat exports are raised 0.5 million tons.  The primary export increase is for EU on a fast pace of both shipments and export licenses.  Imports are raised 0.3 million tons each for Morocco, Philippines, and Thailand, 0.2 million tons each for Jordan and Vietnam, and 0.1 million tons each for Ecuador and Saudi Arabia.

China is lowered 0.3 million tons, also based on the latest official indications.  Production is lowered for Uruguay and Paraguay, down 0.3 million tons and 0.2 million tons, respectively, reflecting dry growing season conditions in both countries and early season freeze damage in Paraguay that also reduced yields. Strong demand in the Middle East and North Africa boosts 2013/14 world wheat imports 3.0 million tons.  Imports are raised for Iran, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Syria, Algeria, Iraq, and Turkey.  Exports are raised for the European Union, Russia, Serbia, and Turkey.  European Union exports are raised 1.5 million tons reflecting the strong pace of licenses with higher corn imports and feeding freeing up more wheat for export.  For Russia, higher wheat imports and reduced wheat feeding support a 1.0-million-ton increase in wheat exports.  Export business has remained strong for both countries well into the second half of the 2013/14 marketing year as prices remain attractive for buyers in the Middle East and North Africa.World wheat consumption is raised slightly for 2013/14 with increased use for India, Iran, Australia, Iraq, and Morocco more than offsetting lower feed use for the European Union and Russia, and for South Korea, where wheat imports are lowered.

If realized, these would be the lowest imports in nine years.  U.S. wheat exports are raised 25 million bushels to 975 million on a strong pace to date, more competitive prices, and reduced supplies from several major competitors.  Hard Red Winter and Durum exports are each raised 10 million bushels, and HRS is raised 5 million.  With reduced supplies and higher use, 2019/20 ending stocks are cut 40 million bushels to 974 million, the lowest in 5 years.

The global outlook for wheat this month is for several mostly offsetting production changes, slightly lower global use and trade, and increased ending stocks.  The Argentina and Australia wheat crops are cut 1.0 million tons and 1.1 million tons, respectively, both on continued drought conditions.  The Argentina crop is now pegged at 19.0 million tons and Australia\u2019s crop is estimated to be 16.1 million tons.  This is Australia\u2019s smallest crop since 2007/08.  Canada\u2019s crop is cut 0.7 million tons to 32.4 million on updated government data.

Supplies are projected falling by 1.1 million tons to 1,066.3 million as reduced production more than offsets higher beginning stocks.  The majority of production decreases are in the Middle East, where both Iraq and Syria are reduced due to the prolonged dry conditions.  Projected 2021/22 world consumption is raised 0.6 million tons to 788.1 million on higher feed and residual use more than offsetting lower food, seed, and industrial use.  The largest feed and residual use changes are for Canada and China.  Canada is raised 1.7 million to 4.5 million as the Statistics Canada December 31 stocks report indicated greater August-December disappearance than previously expected.  China is lowered 1.0 million tons to 35.0 million as domestic wheat prices are no longer at a discount to corn and wheat auctions have not been as active this year. Projected 2021/22 global trade is raised 2.3 million tons to 206.7 million, primarily on higher exports by India and Argentina.  India\u2019s exports are increased to 7.0 million tons, which would be a record - exceeding 2012/13 exports.  India\u2019s export pace continues to be robust, and its prices are competitive in Asian markets.  Argentina\u2019s exports are raised 0.5 million tons to a record 14.0 million on an early strong pace. Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are lowered 1.7 million tons to 278.2 million with reductions for Canada and India partially offset by increases by the United States and Ukraine.  Global stocks are now projected at a 5-year low.   ",
    "April_2017": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2016/17 are raised 30 million bushels on lower feed and residual use which more than offsets a slight import reduction.  At 1,159 million bushels, ending stocks are projected to reach a near 30-year high.  Feed and residual use is lowered 35 million bushels to 190 million which reflects lower-than-expected disappearance for the December-February and September-November quarters, as indicated by March 1 and revised December 1 stocks from the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  The import change is based on the pace to date with reductions for soft red winter and durum.  Global 2016/17 wheat supplies are raised 1.7 million tons due to higher projected beginning stocks and a 0.3-million-ton increase in production.  The change to beginning stocks stems from a 1.4-million-ton reduction in 2015/16 domestic consumption, primarily in the EU.  World exports are lowered 0.3 million tons led by 0.5-million-ton decreases each for Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia.  Partly offsetting are higher projected exports for the EU and Ukraine.  Total global consumption for 2016/17 is lowered 0.6 million tons to 740.8 million with a 1.0-million-ton decrease in the United States, more than offsetting a small net increase for foreign countries.  With supplies rising and use declining, global ending stocks are raised 2.3 million tons to 252.3 million.  ",

Seed use is lowered 6 million bushels on the winter wheat planted area reported today in the Winter Wheat Seedings report.  U.S. supplies for 2015/16 are lowered 6 million bushels on reduced imports and slightly lower beginning stocks.  Projected 2015/16 ending stocks are raised 30 million bushels.  The 2015/16 season average farm price range is narrowed 10 cents on both the high and low ends to $4.90 to $5.10 per bushel.  Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 1.2 million tons on both increased beginning stocks and production.  World wheat production remains record high and is raised 0.5 million tons led by 0.5-million-ton increases for both Russia and Pakistan and a 0.3-million-ton increase for the EU.  Partly offsetting is a 0.7-million-ton reduction for Uruguay and a 0.4-million-ton reduction for Brazil; both reductions are on updated government statistics and reflect crop damage from excessive rain.  World wheat trade for 2015/16 is down fractionally with several, mostly offsetting, changes.  Global use is reduced, mostly in the United States.  With supplies increasing and use reduced, ending stocks are raised 2.2 million tons to a record 232.0 million tons.  This total is 9 percent larger than the previous stocks record set last year.  ",
    "October_2017": "WHEAT:  Projected 2017/18 U.S. wheat supplies are decreased modestly this month as reduced beginning stocks are partially offset by slightly higher wheat production.  Beginning stocks were revised downward in the latest NASS Grain Stocks report while wheat production increased in the NASS Small Grains Annual Summary to 1,741 million bushels.  Although all wheat production increased minimally from last month, the by-class changes are relatively more significant as larger Durum and Hard Red Spring production more than offset declines in Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter.  Projected 2017/18 feed and residual is reduced 30 million bushels this month to 120 million as the NASS Grain Stocks report indicated lower-than-expected June-August disappearance.  Additionally, projected 2017/18 U.S. corn supplies are the second highest on record, which is expected to dampen wheat feed and residual use for the rest of 2017/18.  The other wheat use categories are unchanged this month and projected 2017/18 ending stocks are higher at 960 million bushels but still well below last year\u2019s 1,181 million.  The projected 2017/18 season-average farm price is unchanged this month at the midpoint of $4.60 per bushel but the range is narrowed 10 cents on each end to $4.40 to $4.80.  Global 2017/18 wheat supplies are increased, primarily on higher production forecasts for Russia, EU, and India more than offsetting a decline in Australia.  Based mainly on harvest results to date, Russia\u2019s 2017/18 wheat production is increased 1.0 million tons to a new record of 82.0 million tons.  This is well above last year\u2019s previous record of 72.5 million tons.  EU wheat production is raised 2.2 million tons to 151.0 million, largely on higher production in France.  Australia\u2019s wheat production is reduced 1.0 million tons to 21.5 million on persistent dry conditions in most of eastern Australia.  This would be Australia\u2019s lowest wheat output since the 2008/09 crop year. Foreign 2017/18 trade is fractionally higher this month as reduced exports by Australia are offset by increased exports from Canada.  Projected imports are lowered for India and Turkey as increased 2017/18 production for both countries is expected to reduce import needs.  Total world consumption is projected higher, primarily on greater usage by India, EU, and Russia on their increased supplies.  Projected global ending stocks are nearly 5.0 million tons higher this month at 268.1 million, which is a new record.    ",

Production for 2015/16 is lowered 84 million bushels based on the latest estimate from the NASS September 30 Small Grains 2015 Summary.  Feed and residual use is lowered 20 million bushels reflecting the September 1 stocks that indicated lower-than-expected June-August disappearance.  Exports are lowered 50 million bushels to 850 million on a slow sales pace to date and continued lack of U.S. price competitiveness, particularly compared to Black Sea Countries and EU.  The projected range for the 2015/16 U.S. season-average farm price is narrowed 10 cents on both the high and low ends to $4.75 to $5.25 per bushel.  Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 2.0 million tons, on both increased production and beginning stocks.  The biggest production increases are 1.0 million tons each for Australia and Canada, and 1.1 million tons for EU.  The Canada and EU increases are based on government reports and harvest progress.  Australia had sufficient sub-soil moisture that allowed it to withstand a drier-than-normal September; increased yield potential is supported by satellite imagery.  The United States had the largest production decline.  The global wheat crop is now projected at 732.8 million tons, the third consecutive record. World wheat exports for 2015/16 are raised 3.0 million tons with increases for several key U.S. competitors.  Ukraine is raised 1.5 million tons on a larger crop.  Canada exports are raised 1.0 million tons, and Australia, the EU, Kazakhstan, and Russia are each raised 0.5 million tons.  These increases are based on larger supplies and export pace to date.  Partly offsetting is a 1.4 million ton reduction for the United States and a 0.5 million ton decline for Argentina.  Imports are raised 1.0 million tons in Iran on the elimination of an import duty and 0.5 million tons in Syria because of distribution problems.  Total world usage is up fractionally, and ending stocks are raised 1.9 million tons to a record 228.5 million tons.  ",

Feed and residual use is lowered 60 million bushels reflecting disappearance for June-November as indicated by the December 1 stocks released in the Grain Stocks report.  Feed and residual use is lowered for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Hard Red Spring, and Soft Red Winter wheat.  Seed use is raised 1 million bushels based on the winter wheat planted area reported today in the Winter Wheat Seedings report.  Wheat exports are projected 25 million bushels higher, with an increase for HRW, on the strong pace of sales and shipments and lower expected competition from Argentina, particularly in Brazil\u2019s milling wheat market.  The 2013/14 season-average farm price is projected 10 cents lower at the midpoint with the range narrowed to $6.60 to $7.00 per bushel.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are raised 1.5 million tons to 888.8 million with production increases for China and the FSU-12 more than offsetting reductions for Argentina and the European Union.  Production is raised 1.0 million tons for China reflecting the latest estimate by the China National Grain and Oil Information Center and indications from the National Bureau of Statistics for total 2013/14 grain production.  Production is raised 0.6 million tons for Russia and 0.3 million tons for Tajikistan, both based on the latest official indications.  Production is reduced 0.5 million tons for Argentina with harvested area expected lower.  Production for the European Union is lowered 0.2 million tons with small downward revisions for the United Kingdom, Finland, and Denmark.Global wheat trade for 2013/14 is raised with higher imports projected for Egypt, Japan, and Syria more than offsetting reductions for the Philippines and Tajikistan.  Exports are raised for the European Union and Russia.  Stronger North Africa and Middle East demand drives increases for the European Union and Russia, whereas reductions in Argentina supplies and exports indicate a shift to U.S. supplies for Brazil.  Foreign wheat feeding is lower mostly reflecting a 1.0-million-ton reduction for the European Union where increased exports reduce supplies available to the domestic market.  Larger barley supplies in the European Union this month support a shift to barley feeding.  Global wheat ending stocks are projected 2.6 million tons higher mostly on increases for China and the United States.",

Imports are projected 15 million bushels lower (mostly durum) based on available shipment data.  Feed and residual use is projected 10 million bushels higher on disappearance during the December-February and September-November quarters as indicated by March 1 stocks and revisions to December 1 stocks, both from the March 31 Grain Stocks report.  The all wheat export projection is lowered 20 million bushels on continued strong competition in global markets.  This would be the lowest export total since 2009/10.  The projected season-average farm price range for all wheat is raised 10 cents on the low end to $6.00 to $6.10 per bushel. Global 2014/15 wheat supplies are raised 0.8 million tons with increased production more than offsetting lower beginning stocks.  The largest production increase is for EU, up 0.8 million tons for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 on revised country data.  The Pakistan crop for 2014/15 is also raised 0.5 million tons.  Global beginning stocks are lowered 0.9 million tons mostly on an EU increase in wheat feeding for 2013/14.  World wheat imports for 2014/15 are raised 1.5 million tons mostly on the addition of six African countries (Benin, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Rwanda, and Uganda) to the official USDA wheat database this month.  Global exports are also raised 1.5 million tons with EU having by far the biggest increase.  EU exports are raised 2 million tons to a record 33.5 million on the continued fast pace of export licenses and the competitiveness of EU supplies to key markets in the Middle East and North Africa.  Canada and Russia are each raised 0.5 million tons.  Canada is raised on a strong pace to date and Russia on expectations that small shipments will continue despite export taxes.  Argentina is lowered 1 million tons on the slow pace of export licenses. Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is raised 1.3 million tons largely on the addition of the six African countries.

Ending stocks are cut by a corresponding amount and are now forecast to total 940 million bushels, a five-year low.  Global wheat supplies are lowered fractionally on small and mostly offsetting changes to beginning stocks and production.  World exports are increased 1.8 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for the EU on strong shipments and more competitive prices.  Kazakhstan is raised 0.8 million tons, also on a fast export pace.  United States is increased 0.7 million tons and is projected to have the largest exports in three years.  Partly offsetting are export reductions of 0.5 million tons for Canada and 0.3 million tons for Pakistan.  World imports for 2019/20 are raised 1.9 million tons led by a 0.8-million-ton increase for China and a 0.7-million-ton increase for Turkey, both on a strong pace to date.

The all wheat yield, projected at 44.1 bushels per acre, is down 2.2 bushels from the record levels of 2012/13 and 2010/11.  The survey-based forecast for winter wheat production is down 10 percent with the lowest harvested-to-planted ratio since 2006/07 and lower yields as persistent drought and April freezes reduce crop prospects in the southern and central Plains.  Partly offsetting is higher forecast Soft Red Winter wheat production with higher area.  Spring wheat production for 2013/14 is projected to decline 8 percent as reduced durum area and a return to trend yields reduce prospects for durum and other spring wheat.  Total U.S. wheat use for 2013/14 is projected down 7 percent year-to-year with lower domestic use and exports.  Feed and residual disappearance is projected 70 million bushels lower as larger supplies and lower prices for feed grains in 2013/14 limit wheat feeding by late summer.  Partly offsetting is a 13-million-bushel increase in domestic food use as flour extraction rates fall from a very high level in 2012/13 and consumption grows with population.  Exports for 2013/14 are projected at 925 million bushels, down 100 million from the 2012/13 projection.  Large crops for major export competitors limit opportunities for U.S. wheat.  U.S. ending stocks are projected to decline for a fourth consecutive year.  At 670 million bushels, ending stocks would be down 61 million bushels from the 2012/13 projection.  The all wheat season-average farm price is projected at $6.15 to $7.45 per bushel, down from the record $7.80 projected for 2012/13 as world prices for wheat and coarse grains are expected to decline sharply by fall.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are projected 3 percent higher than in 2012/13 with a 51.2-million-ton increase in foreign production more than offsetting a 19.3-million-ton reduction in global beginning stocks and lower forecast production in the United States.  At the projected 701.1 million tons, global production would be a record and up 45.5 million from 2012/13.

Production is projected higher for Australia, Argentina, and Canada, up a collective 6.2 million tons from the current year.  Also affecting global trade prospects in 2013/14 are year-to-year production increases for major importers, the Middle East and North Africa, where weather has been favorable for winter crops since seeding last fall.Global wheat exports for 2013/14 are projected higher than in 2012/13 with increases expected for FSU-12, Argentina, and India more than offsetting reductions for EU-27 and Australia.  Global wheat consumption is projected 20.0 million tons higher with increases in both feeding and food use.  Wheat feed and residual use is raised for FSU-12 and EU-27 with larger production.  The largest increase in food use is for in India, but lower prices support small increases for many countries.

Conversely, Hard Red Winter (HRW) exports are reduced on a continued slow pace.  Durum imports are raised on the pace to date while HRS is lowered.  Durum and HRS food use are raised while HRW and Soft Red Winter are lowered.  These changes are mainly based on the NASS Flour Millings Products report and Census trade data.  The season-average farm price is raised $0.15 per bushel to $5.00 based on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for futures and cash prices for the remainder of the marketing year. The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for greater supplies, increased consumption, higher exports, and reduced stocks.  Supplies are raised 0.8 million tons to 1,073.5 million.  Global production is increased to a record 773.4 million tons as higher production in Kazakhstan more than offsets reduced production in Pakistan and Argentina.  World 2020/21 consumption is increased 9.8 million tons to 769.3 million, mostly on higher feed and residual use for China and increased food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use for India.  China\u2019s 2020/21 feed and residual use is raised to a record 30.0 million tons, surpassing the previous 2012/13 record of 26.0 million.  China\u2019s domestic corn prices continue to be at a premium to wheat, encouraging greater wheat feed use.  Additionally, increased auction volumes of old-crop stocks in China have expanded the availability of feed-quality wheat.  India\u2019s FSI is raised 3.5 million tons to a record 96.5 million as government stocks data indicate greater disappearance than previously estimated.  This is likely the result of the inclusion of wheat products in India\u2019s government food assistance programs to address economic disruptions caused by COVID-19. Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 1.1 million tons to 194.8 million tons as higher exports for the EU-27+UK and Kazakhstan more than offset lower exports for Argentina.  EU-27+UK exports are raised on a strong export pace and improved price competitiveness with Russia.  Kazakhstan exports are increased on its pace to date and greater exportable supplies.  Argentina\u2019s are lowered on reduced supplies and a slow export pace to date.  The largest import change this month is for China, where imports are raised to 10.0 million tons on a continued robust pace.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 9.0 million tons to 304.2 million with most of the reductions due to increased consumption for China and India.

Global exports are lowered with 0.5-million-ton reductions each for Australia, Canada, India, and Ukraine, and a 0.3-million-ton reduction for Brazil.  Most of the export reductions reflect the pace of shipments reported to date, but reductions for Australia and Canada are also related to the lower import outlook for China.  For Ukraine, the latest trade data indicate a shift in export business from wheat to corn.  Partly offsetting the reductions is a 1.0-million-ton increase for Kazakhstan exports with reports of larger rail shipments to Russia and strong sales to Iran and China.

    "February_2019": "WHEAT:  Projected 2018/19 wheat ending stocks are raised 36 million bushels on reduced feed and residual use and lower seed use.  Feed and residual use is lowered 30 million bushels on larger than expected second-quarter stocks reported in today\u2019s NASS Grain Stocks report.  Seed use is down 6 million bushels reflecting 2019/20 winter wheat planted area released today in the NASS Winter Wheat and Canola Seedings report.  Winter wheat planted area is lower than expected on excessive precipitation and cool temperatures during the planting window.  Ending stocks are now projected at 1,010 million bushels.  The season-average farm price is unchanged based on NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.  World production for the 2018/19 market year is raised 1.3 million tons, led by a 1.6-million-ton increase for Russia, a 0.6-million-ton increase for Brazil, and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Paraguay.  These changes are partly offset by a 1.1 million ton decrease for China and a 0.3-million-ton decrease for Argentina.  All these production changes reflect updated government statistics and harvest results.  Global exports are raised 1.3 million tons led by a 0.7-million-ton increase for Pakistan on reports of new export subsidies.  Russian exports are raised 0.5 million tons and Paraguay is raised 0.4 million tons, both on larger exportable supplies.  In contrast, Australia\u2019s exports are lowered 0.5 million tons on a slow pace to date, and Argentina exports are down 0.2 million tons reflecting the smaller crop.  Global use for 2018/19 is raised 2.0 million tons, primarily on a 2.0-million-ton increase in China feed and residual use.  With global use rising more than supplies, world ending stocks are lowered 0.6 million tons to 267.5 million.  ",
    "May_2016": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat supplies for 2016/17 are projected up 6 percent from 2015/16 on higher beginning stocks and imports.  All wheat production is projected at 1,998 million bushels, down 3 percent.  The year-to-year decrease is due to a sharp reduction in planted area that more than offsets increased yields.  The all wheat yield is projected at 46.7 bushels per acre, up 7 percent from the previous year.  The survey-based forecast for 2016/17 winter wheat production is up with higher yields more than offsetting reduced harvested area.  Winter wheat has benefited from excellent spring growing conditions and yields are projected higher for Hard Red Winter, Soft Red Winter, and White Winter.  Spring wheat and Durum production for 2016/17 is projected to decline 16 percent on lower area, as well as a return to trend yield, which is below last year\u2019s level.  Total U.S. wheat use for 2016/17 is projected up 7 percent from the previous year on higher exports, feed and residual use, and food use. The 2016/17 exports are projected at 875 million bushels, up 95 million bushels from the previous year\u2019s low level but still well below average. Large supplies in several major competing countries will continue to limit U.S. exports. Feed and residual use is projected up 30 million bushels on increased supplies. U.S. ending stocks are projected to rise 51 million bushels from the elevated 2015/16 total to 1,029 million, the highest since the 1987/88 crop year. The all wheat season-average farm price is projected at $3.70 to $4.50 per bushel; the mid-point of this range is the lowest in 11 years.  Global wheat supplies are projected to rise 2 percent from 2015/16 as increased beginning stocks more than offset a decline in production from the previous year\u2019s record. Total wheat production is projected at 727.0 million tons, the second highest total on record. Large crops are expected in most key competing countries and favorable spring growing conditions suggest that yields will be well above trend in the EU, Russia, and Ukraine.  Global wheat consumption for 2016/17 is projected slightly higher than in 2015/16 with higher food use more than offsetting a reduction in world wheat feeding. Global import demand for 2016/17 is down from last year\u2019s record, but still very large.  Global ending stocks for 2016/17 are projected at a record 257.3 million tons, up 14.4 million from 2015/16.",
    "August_2015": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2015/16 are lowered on a smaller crop and reduced imports.  An increase in spring wheat production is more than offset by decreases for Hard Red Winter, Soft Red Winter, and White Wheat.  Hard Red Spring wheat yields in North Dakota are forecast to be a record.  Projected imports are lowered 5 million bushels on the larger U.S. Hard Red Spring crop and lower Canadian production.  All wheat exports for 2015/16 are projected 25 million bushels lower at 925 million on a slow pace to date and increased foreign supplies.  Ending stocks are raised 8 million bushels to 850 million, the largest since 2010/11.  The season-average farm price is lowered 10 cents on the low end and 20 cents on the high end to $4.65 to $5.55 per bushel. Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 2.2 million tons primarily on increased production in the FSU and Turkey.  A 2.4-million-ton reduction in global beginning stocks partially offsets the production increase; EU accounts for over 60 percent of the reduction.  World wheat production is projected at a record.  Crop conditions in the spring wheat areas of Russia and Kazakhstan continue to be excellent.  Winter wheat production in Russia and Ukraine is better than expected, particularly considering last autumn\u2019s drought.  A 1-million-ton reduction for Canada, due to drought conditions in the western prairies, is partially offsetting.  Argentina production was lowered 0.4 million tons to 11.1 million.  World exports are lower with the biggest decreases for Canada (smaller crop), Argentina (smaller crop and lower carryin), and the United States.  Global imports are also down with the biggest changes being a 1-million-ton reduction for Iran offset by a 1-million-ton increase for Morocco.  Iran\u2019s imports are reduced as a result of a newly imposed import duty and the Morocco change is from a Foreign Agricultural Service GAIN report.  Global use is up slightly, supported by increased feed and residual use for EU, Russia, and Ukraine.  With supplies growing faster than use, global ending stocks are raised 1.7 million tons to a record 221.5 million tons.",
    "December_2022": "WHEAT:  This month\u2019s 2022/23 U.S. wheat supply and use outlook is unchanged from last month.  There are offsetting changes for exports by-class with Hard Red Spring and White higher and Soft Red Winter lower.  The 2022/23 season-average farm price is forecast $0.10 per bushel lower at $9.10, based on prices received to date and expectations for futures and cash prices for the remainder of 2022/23. The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 wheat is for reduced supplies, lower consumption, increased trade, and reduced stocks.  Supplies are lowered 2.1 million tons to 1,056.9 million on reduced production for Argentina and Canada that is only partly offset by higher Australia production.  Argentina is lowered 3.0 million tons to 12.5 million with reductions in both area harvested and yield on continued widespread dry conditions.  This would be the lowest production since 2015/16.  Canada\u2019s production is reduced 1.2 million tons to 33.8 million, based on the latest Statistics Canada estimate and is the third largest crop on record.  Australia\u2019s production is raised 2.1 million tons to a record 36.6 million, based on the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARES) forecast.  Global consumption is reduced 1.6 million tons to 789.5 million, mainly on lower feed and residual use by the EU and Ukraine.  World trade is raised 2.2 million tons to 210.9 million on higher exports by Australia, Ukraine, the EU, and Russia more than offsetting reduced exports by Argentina.  Australia exports are raised 1.5 million tons to a near-record 27.5 million.  Because of excessive rains in New South Wales at harvest, Australia\u2019s feed wheat supplies are expected to be greater for 2022/23 and competitively priced against feed grains for East Asian importers.  This resulted in higher imports for South Korea and several Southeast Asian countries this month.  Ukraine exports are increased 1.5 million tons to 12.5 million.  Argentina\u2019s exports are reduced 2.5 million tons to 7.5 million with lower exportable supplies.  This would be Argentina\u2019s lowest exports since 2014/15.  Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are decreased 0.5 million tons to 267.3 million as reductions for Russia, Canada, Argentina, and Ukraine more than offset increases for the EU and Australia.",
    "March_2013": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat exports for 2012/13 are projected 25 million bushels lower this month boosting projected ending stocks by the same amount.  Continued strong competition, particularly from EU-27 and FSU-12, further reduce prospects for U.S. wheat shipments.  Projected exports for Hard Red Winter wheat are lowered 25 million bushels.  Exports are also lowered 10 million bushels and 5 million bushels, respectively, for White and Hard Red Spring wheat, but raised 15 million bushels for Soft Red Winter wheat.  All-wheat imports are unchanged, but small adjustments are made among the classes.  Trade changes largely reflect the pace of sales and shipments to date.  The projected range for the season-average farm price for wheat is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint and narrowed to $7.65 to $7.95 per bushel.Global wheat supplies for 2012/13 are raised 1.8 million tons with higher production.  India production is increased 1.0 million tons based on the latest revisions by the government of India for the crop harvested nearly a year ago.  EU-27 production is raised 0.5 million tons based on the latest production estimate released by the government of Lithuania.  Production is estimated 0.3 million tons higher for Nepal in line with historical revisions to the country's production series this month.Global wheat trade is projected higher for 2012/13.  Imports are raised 1.0 million tons for Iran, 0.5 million tons for South Korea, 0.3 million tons for Algeria, and 0.2 million tons each for China and Japan.  Partly offsetting are reductions of 1.0 million tons for Egypt and 0.2 million tons for Kenya.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons for EU-27, 0.5 million tons for Brazil, and 0.3 million tons for Ukraine, more than offsetting this month\u2019s reduction for the United States.  World wheat feed use is increased 1.3 million tons with 0.5-million-ton increases for Australia, Canada, and South Korea, and a 0.1-million-ton increase for Japan outweighing a 0.3-million-ton decrease for Egypt.  Lower expected food use in India, Egypt, and Kenya limit the increase in global wheat consumption.  World wheat ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected 1.5 million tons higher with the largest increases for India, Iran, and the United States.  The biggest reductions in ending stocks are for Australia, Egypt, EU-27, Brazil, Canada, and Ukraine.",
    "August_2014": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised this month mostly with an increase in forecast Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat production as well as smaller increases for Soft Red Winter (SRW), Hard Red Spring (HRS), and Durum.  Northern parts of the HRW belt have substantially higher yields than the drought damaged southern and central plains.  The largest HRW increases are in Colorado and Nebraska.  After a delay in planting, HRS wheat has had very good growing conditions and yields are forecast well above average.  Feed and residual use for all wheat in 2014/15 is raised 10 million bushels to 155 million due to the larger supplies.  All wheat exports for 2014/15 are increased 25 million bushels because of the larger HRW crop.  The projected season-average farm price range is lowered 30 cents at the midpoint to $5.80 to $6.80 per bushel.  World wheat production for 2014/15 is raised 10.9 million tons to a record 716.1 million.  The largest foreign increases are 6.0 million tons for Russia, 2.0 million tons for China, and 1.0 million tons for Ukraine.  The Russia and Ukraine increases are based on harvest reports that indicate very high winter wheat yields, especially for Russia.  The China increase reflects the latest government estimates for summer harvested grains.  Production is also raised 0.6 million tons for Belarus and 0.4 million tons for Moldova.  Global wheat consumption is raised 6.9 million tons due mainly to increased prospects for wheat feeding.  The biggest feeding increase is for EU, which is raised 2.5 million tons.  Excessive harvest-time precipitation in several European production regions has increased the quantity of feed-quality wheat.  Russia wheat feeding is raised 1.0 million tons, and Ukraine and Belarus are each raised 0.5 million tons due to increased production in those countries.  Smaller feeding increases are made for Philippines, Moldova, and Israel.  Global wheat trade for 2014/15 is nearly unchanged with increases in Russia and the United States offset by reductions in EU and several other countries.  The changes reflect larger crops in Russia and the United States as well as quality problems in EU.  India exports are lowered 0.5 million tons because of competition, especially from lower quality wheat in Ukraine and southeastern EU.  China and Russia imports are lowered 1.0 million tons and 0.5 million tons, respectively, because of increased production.  Egypt imports are lowered 0.5 million tons due to changes in its bread subsidy program that are expected to reduce waste.  Iran imports are raised 0.5 million tons reflecting government announced purchases.  With supplies rising faster than use, global ending stocks are raised 3.4 million tons and remain at a 3-year high.",
    "May_2017": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat supplies for 2017/18 are projected down 9 percent from 2016/17 on lower production, which is partially offset by higher beginning stocks.  All wheat production for 2017/18 is projected at 1,820 million bushels, down nearly 500 million bushels from the prior year.  The year-to-year decline is due to a sharp reduction in planted area and projected lower yields.  The all wheat yield is projected at 47.2 bushels per acre, down 10 percent from last year\u2019s record.  The first survey-based forecast for 2017/18 winter wheat production is down sharply with the lowest harvested area in more than a century and lower yields.  Winter wheat benefited from diminishing drought conditions in the Plains and Midwest.  However, a late April snow storm affected large portions of the Hard Red Winter wheat belt, especially western Kansas.  Combined spring wheat and Durum production for 2017/18 is projected to decline 10 percent on lower area and a return to trend yields.  Total use for 2017/18 is projected down 2 percent on lower exports and feed and residual use.  Exports are projected at 1.0 billion bushels, down 35 million from the previous year\u2019s revised level but above the five-year average.  The EU is expected to regain export market share following last year\u2019s small crop and quality problems.  U.S. feed and residual use is projected down 20 million bushels on lower supplies.  U.S. ending stocks are projected to decline 245 million bushels to 914 million, the lowest in three years.  The season-average farm price is projected at $3.85 to $4.65 per bushel.  The mid-point of this range is up $0.35 from the previous year\u2019s low level.  Global wheat supplies are projected to decline fractionally as higher beginning stocks are more than offset by a production decline following last year\u2019s record.  Total wheat production is projected at 737.8 million tons, the second highest total on record.  Global wheat consumption is projected down slightly from last year\u2019s record with reduced feed and residual usage partially offset by increased food use.  Global imports are expected to be a record for the fifth consecutive year.  Global ending stocks are projected at a record 258.3 million tons, up 2.9 million from 2016/17.  ",
    "February_2018": "WHEAT:  Projected 2017/18 U.S. ending stocks are raised this month by 20 million bushels as higher food use is more than offset by lower exports, while export forecasts for several major competitors are increased.  Estimated food use is increased by 5 million bushels to 955 million, based on the NASS Flour Milling Products report, which indicated higher-than-expected use in the first half of 2017/18.  Additionally, implied flour extraction rates were lower in the second quarter, as compared to last year, and a continuation of this trend is expected to support increased wheat for food usage into the second half of 2017/18.  No other supply or use categories are changed this month.  Based on NASS prices reported to date and price expectations for the rest of the marketing year, the projected season-average farm price (SAFP) remains unchanged at the midpoint of $4.60 per bushel.  However, the projected SAFP range is narrowed by 5 cents at both ends of the range to $4.55 to $4.65.Global 2017/18 wheat supplies increased, primarily on higher production forecasts for Argentina and Ukraine.  Argentina\u2019s wheat production increased by 500,000 tons to 18.0 million based on higher-than-expected yields from the later harvest stages.  Ukraine wheat production increased 481,000 tons to 27.0 million based on updated government data. World 2017/18 trade is raised this month as higher exports from Russia, Argentina, and Canada more than offset reduced exports from the EU and the United States.  Projected imports are increased for Indonesia and several African countries while reduced for India, the EU, Iran, Brazil, and Mexico.  Indonesia\u2019s imports are raised 1.0 million tons to 12.5 million on increases for both food and feed use.  Indonesia is now the leading global wheat importer, surpassing Egypt, the traditional leader.  Total world consumption is projected 3.1 million tons higher, primarily on greater usage from Indonesia and China.  Projected global ending stocks are 1.9 million tons lower this month at 266.1 million but remain significantly higher than a year ago.",
    "April_2013": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected 15 million bushels higher this month with a small increase in seed use more than offset by lower expected feed and residual disappearance.  Seed use for 2012/13 is raised slightly based on producer planting intentions for 2013/14 as reported in the March 28 Prospective Plantings.  Feed and residual use for 2012/13 is projected 15 million bushels lower reflecting lower-than-expected disappearance during the December-February quarter as indicated by the March 1 stocks.  Feed and residual use is projected lower for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Hard Red Spring wheat, but declines are partly offset by higher expected feed and residual use for Soft Red Winter and White wheat.  All-wheat imports are unchanged, but a small increase in HRW wheat is offset by a decline in durum.  The projected range for the wheat season-average farm price is narrowed  5 cents on both ends to $7.70 to $7.90 per bushel.Global wheat supplies for 2012/13 are raised 2.9 million tons on higher world beginning stocks with the biggest increases for EU-27, Morocco, and Mexico.  The increased stocks primarily reflect balance sheet revisions that lower 2011/12 domestic wheat use for several countries this month.  Global 2012/13 production is nearly unchanged, but notable changes are made for some countries.  Production is raised 0.5 million tons for Morocco with an upward yield revision.  EU-27 production is decreased 0.2 million tons with lower reported output for the United Kingdom.  Saudi Arabia production is lowered 0.2 million tons with lower area.  Smaller reductions are made for Chile and Tunisia.Global wheat trade is projected higher for 2012/13 with exports raised 2.6 million tons.  Exports are increased 1.0 million tons each for Australia and EU-27.  Exports are also raised for the FSU-12 with Ukraine up 0.5 million tons and Russia up 0.2 million tons.  Import changes are made for a number of countries.  The biggest increases are for Iran, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates.  The biggest declines are for Morocco, Russia, Bangladesh, Mexico, and Vietnam.  World wheat feed and residual use is lowered 5.2 million tons with much of the decline resulting from a 3.0-million-ton reduction for China.  Wheat feed use is also lowered 1.0 million tons for EU-27 with smaller reductions made for Russia, Vietnam, and Ukraine.  World wheat ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected 4.0 million tons higher with China stocks raised 3.0 million.  Increases for North Africa, EU-27, Iran, and the United States more than offset a 1.0-million-ton reduction for Australia and smaller reductions for FSU-12 and Saudi Arabia.",

The survey-based forecast for 2015/16 all winter wheat production is up 7 percent with both higher yields and harvested area.  A decline in Soft Red Winter wheat harvested area is more than offset by increased Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat harvested area.  This year\u2019s HRW yield is above last year\u2019s low level, but drought and winterkill have adversely affected the crop again.  White Winter wheat production is projected up 10 percent from last year mainly on higher yields.  Spring wheat production for 2015/16 is projected to decline 5 percent on an assumed return to trend yields from last year\u2019s near-record level, more than offsetting a slight increase in harvested area.  Total U.S. wheat use for 2015/16 is projected up 4 percent from the previous year on higher exports, feed and residual use, and food use.  The 2015/16 exports are projected at 925 million bushels, up 65 million bushels from the previous year\u2019s low level but still below the 5 year-average.  Large supplies in several major competing countries will continue to limit U.S. exports.  Feed and residual use is projected up 20 million bushels on increased supplies.  U.S. ending stocks are projected to rise 84 million bushels to 793 million, the highest since the 2010/11 crop year.  The all wheat season-average farm price is projected at $4.50 to $5.50 per bushel.  Global wheat supplies are projected to rise fractionally from 2014/15 as increased beginning stocks more than offset a slight decline in production from the previous year\u2019s record.  Total wheat production is projected at 718.9 million tons, the second highest total on record.  Foreign production is down 9.2 million tons with reductions for EU, India, Russia, and Ukraine more than offsetting increases for China, Turkey, Morocco, Australia, Iran, and Syria.  Global wheat consumption for 2015/16 is projected slightly higher than in 2014/15 with higher food use more than offsetting a reduction in world wheat feeding.  Global import demand for 2015/16 is lower with the largest reductions coming from Turkey, Iran, Morocco, and Syria all on greatly improved crop prospects.  Exports are lower for Canada, India, EU, Russia, and Ukraine, but higher for Argentina and Australia.

Projected imports are lowered 5 million bushels on larger supplies of U.S. spring wheat.  All wheat exports for 2016/17 are projected 25 million bushels higher to 950 million on expectations of an improved competitive situation and a sharp reduction of EU wheat production, which is expected to benefit North American suppliers.  Feed and residual use is raised 30 million bushels on the larger domestic crop.  The increased use offsets the higher supplies and ending stocks are slightly lower.  The season-average farm price is lowered 5 cents on the low end and 15 cents on the high end to $3.35 to $4.05 per bushel. Global wheat supplies for 2016/17 are raised 2.3 million tons on a 4.9-million production increase that is partially offset by a decrease in beginning stocks.  The Russia wheat crop is raised 7.0 million tons to 72.0 million on excellent growing conditions throughout the country and harvest reports showing very high yields. Ukraine and Kazakhstan are raised 2.0 million tons each, also on harvest reports and favorable weather.  Australia and Canada production is raised 1.0 million tons each, on favorable growing conditions.  These large production increases are partially offset by a 9.0-million-ton reduction in the EU, due to excessive rain in key growing regions, particularly in France.  Unrelenting rain during flowering and grain fill damaged crop quality and sharply lowered yield prospects.  French yields are projected to be the lowest in nearly thirty years.  For the EU as a whole, 2016/17 yields are projected to be the lowest since 2012/13.  Global trade is raised 2.3 million tons on larger global supplies.  Russia exports are raised 4.5 million tons to a record 30.0 million on the sharp production increase.  Russia is projected to be the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter for the first time.  Ukraine exports are raised 2.0 million tons, and Australia, Canada, and Kazakhstan are each raised 1.0 million, all due to increased production.  These increases are partially offset by a 7.0-million-ton reduction in EU exports due to the sharply smaller crop.  Argentina exports are also lowered 1.0 million tons on reduced production and lower beginning stocks.  Global use is up 3.2 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase in Russia feed use, a 0.8-million-ton increase in U.S. feed use, and a 0.4-million-ton increase in Afghanistan food use.

    "December_2021": "WHEAT:  The outlook for 2021/22 U.S. wheat this month is for slightly lower supplies, unchanged domestic use, reduced exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are lowered, on decreased imports with a weaker-than-expected pace for Hard Red Spring (HRS).  Exports are lowered 20 million bushels to 840 million on slowing export sales and shipments with equivalent reductions for Hard Red Winter and HRS.  Additionally, U.S. export prices are expected to remain elevated the rest of 2021/22, further diminishing U.S. competitiveness.  Projected 2021/22 ending stocks are raised 15 million bushels to 598 million but are still 29 percent lower than last year.  The projected season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised $0.15 per bushel to $7.05 on NASS prices reported to date and expectations for cash and futures prices for the remainder of 2021/22.  This would be the highest SAFP since 2012/13. The global wheat outlook for 2021/22 is for higher supplies, greater consumption, increased trade, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are projected rising by 4.3 million tons to 1,067.5 million, primarily on the combination of increased beginning stocks for Australia and the EU and upward production revisions for Australia, Russia, and Canada.  Australia\u2019s production is raised 2.5 million tons to a record 34.0 million, based mainly on the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) forecast.  Russia\u2019s production is increased 1.0 million tons to 75.5 million, all for winter wheat on updated Ministry of Agriculture data.  Canada\u2019s production is raised 0.7 million tons to 21.7 million on the latest Statistics Canada forecast.  Despite the increases for Russia and Canada, their respective production levels remain significantly below last year. Projected 2021/22 world consumption is raised 1.9 million tons to 789.4 million on higher feed and residual use more than offsetting lower food, seed, and industrial use.  Most of the feed and residual use increases are for Australia and Russia on higher production and for the EU, as more wheat feeding is expected with extended rains affecting grain quality at harvest.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is raised 2.3 million tons to a record 205.5 million on higher exports by Australia, EU, India, and Ukraine.  The largest import change is for Iran, up 1.5 million tons to 7.0 million on further reductions in production and heightened import activity.  These would the largest Iranian wheat imports on record, surpassing 6.8 million tons in 2008/09.  Projected 2021/22 world ending stocks are raised 2.4 million tons to 278.2 million with most of the increases from Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Supplies are reduced on lower imports, which are decreased 5 million bushels to 120 million on a slower-than-expected pace.  Exports are raised 10 million bushels to 985 million as higher white wheat exports are partially offset by lower Hard Red Winter (HRW) exports.  Sales and shipments of white wheat have been robust this marketing year to several East Asian countries.  Conversely, HRW exports have slowed for the past several weeks.  Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are reduced 15 million bushels to 862 million, down 16 percent from last year.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at $4.70 per bushel.

Supplies are raised 1.2 million tons to 1,074.3 million on higher global production, which is now a new record at 773.7 million.  Most of this month\u2019s production increase is for Australia, which is raised 1.5 million tons to 30.0 million.  This increase is partially based on the latest ABARES production forecast.  Russia\u2019s production is raised 500,000 tons to 84.0 million with the harvest results now complete.  Canada\u2019s wheat production is raised 0.2 million tons to 35.2 million on the final Statistics Canada estimate for the 2020/21 crop year.  With this month\u2019s production changes, Australia, Canada, and Russia all have their second largest wheat production on record.   World 2020/21 consumption is increased 5.1 million tons to 757.8 million, mostly on higher feed and residual use for China, Australia, and the EU.  China is raised 3.0 million tons to 24.0 million, which would be its highest wheat feed and residual use since 2012/13.  Increased wheat feed usage is expected as China\u2019s domestic price premium of wheat over corn has narrowed significantly this year with greater supplies of old-crop wheat available through government auctions of grain stocks.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 2.9 million tons to 193.7 million on higher exports for Australia, Canada, Russia and the United States.  The largest import increases this month are for China and Pakistan, each raised 500,000 tons.  China\u2019s import pace continues to be significantly higher than last year and at 8.5 million tons, imports would be the largest since 1995/96.  Pakistan continues to actively import wheat to raise stocks in order to alleviate food price inflation concerns.  Pakistan\u2019s imports of 2.5 million tons would be its largest since 2008/09.  Projected 2020/21 world ending stocks are lowered 3.9 million tons to 316.5 million but remain record high with China and India holding 51 and 10 percent of the total, respectively. ",
    "August_2017": "WHEAT:  Projected 2017/18 U.S. wheat supplies are decreased this month on lower production, down 21 million bushels to 1,739 million.  The August NASS production forecasts for durum and other spring wheat indicated a significant decline compared to last year, primarily due to continued severe drought conditions affecting the Northern Plains.  Partially offsetting this decrease is higher winter wheat production, on increased yields, with most of the production increase for white wheat.  Food use estimates for both 2016/17 and 2017/18 are reduced, based primarily on the August 1, NASS Flour Milling Products report.  The other wheat usage categories for 2017/18 are unchanged this month.  Projected 2017/18 ending stocks are decreased 5 million bushels to 933 million.  The 2017/18 season-average farm price is unchanged at the midpoint of $4.80 per bushel and the projected range remains at $4.40 to $5.20.  Global 2017/18 wheat supplies increased significantly, primarily on an 8.6-million-ton production increase in the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  Russian production is a record 77.5 million tons, surpassing last year\u2019s record by 5.0 million.  Winter wheat yields are forecast higher for both Russia and Ukraine, based mainly on harvest results to date.  Additionally, spring wheat conditions have remained very favorable for both Russia and Kazakhstan, resulting in higher production forecasts.  Canadian wheat production is reduced 1.9 million tons to 26.5 million on the increasing intensification of drought conditions in major production areas of the Prairie Provinces.  The increased FSU production more than offsets reduced production forecasts in Canada, EU, and U.S., raising 2017/18 global production by more than 5.0 million tons to 743.2 million.Foreign 2017/18 trade is increased on higher exports for Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan more than offsetting reductions in Canada and EU.  Projected imports are raised for several countries, led by Indonesia and Nigeria.  Total world consumption is projected higher, primarily on greater usage by Russia, Indonesia, and Nigeria.  Projected global ending stocks are 4.1 million tons higher this month at 264.7 million, which is a new record.",
    "May_2014": "WHEAT:  U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are projected down 10 percent from 2013/14 with beginning stocks, production, and imports all expected lower.  Supplies for the new marketing year are projected to be the lowest since 2007/08.  Production is projected at 1,963 million bushels, down 8 percent from last year.  The all wheat yield is projected at 42.7 bushels per acre, down 4.5 bushels from the 2013/14 record.  The survey-based forecast for 2014/15 all winter wheat production is down 9 percent on the year with the harvested-to-planted ratio just above last year\u2019s 11-year low and the yield forecast at its lowest level since 2007/08.  Most of the decline year to year in winter wheat reflects lower area and yields for Soft Red Winter wheat.  This year\u2019s lower Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat yield forecast is offset by higher harvested area, leaving HRW production just above last year\u2019s very low level.  Continued drought and April freeze events have sharply reduced yield prospects for HRW wheat.  White Winter wheat production is forecast lower on the year with reduced area and yields.  Spring wheat production for 2014/15 is projected to decline 6 percent as higher area is more than offset by lower projected yields.  Durum yields last year were well above trend and other spring yields were record high.Total U.S. wheat use for 2014/15 is projected down 11 percent year to year as feed and residual disappearance and exports are expected to fall with tighter supplies and higher prices.  Projected feed and residual disappearance is down 50 million bushels as abundant feed grain supplies and lower feed grain prices limit wheat feeding during the summer months.  Partly offsetting are a 10-million-bushel increase in domestic food use and a 2-million-bushel increase in seed use.  Exports for 2014/15 are projected at 950 million bushels, down 235 million from this month\u2019s higher 2013/14 projection, as large supplies in other major exporting countries and tight domestic supplies of HRW wheat limit U.S. shipments.  U.S. ending stocks are projected to decline for a fifth consecutive year.  At 540 million bushels, 2014/15 ending stocks would be down 43 million from 2013/14.  The all wheat season-average farm price is projected at $6.65 to $7.95 per bushel.  Global 2014/15 wheat supplies are projected down less than 1 percent from 2013/14 as reduced beginning stocks and production in the United States offset higher foreign beginning stocks.  World wheat production is projected at 697.0 million tons, down 2 percent from the 2013/14 record.  Foreign production is projected 12.4 million tons lower in 2014/15 with increases for Argentina, the European Union, China, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and India more than offset by reductions for Canada, Turkey, Morocco, Ukraine, Australia, Iran, and Syria.  Lower area and a return to trend yields also reduce production in Canada from last year\u2019s record high.  In the Middle East, persistent dryness and early April freezes have severely damaged winter wheat crops from Turkey to northeastern Iran.  For Ukraine, lower reported area and a return to trend yields reduce expected output.Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is projected 1 percent lower than in 2013/14 with a reduction in world wheat feeding only partly offset by higher expected food use.  Global import demand for 2014/15 is lower with reductions for China, Iran, Brazil, Mexico, and Algeria more than offsetting increases for the European Union and Turkey.  Exports are lower for the European Union, India, Canada, Ukraine, Turkey, and Australia, but higher for Argentina and Russia.  Global ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected at 187.4 million tons, up 0.9 million from 2013/14. ",
    "January_2013": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2012/13 are lowered 38 million bushels this month.  Feed and residual use is projected 35 million bushels higher as December 1 stocks, reported in the January Grain Stocks, indicate higher-than-expected disappearance during September-November.  Seed use is raised 2 million bushels based on the winter wheat planted area reported in Winter Wheat Seedings.  Projected exports for all wheat are unchanged; however, Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat exports are lowered 25 million bushels and Soft Red Winter (SRW) wheat exports are raised 25 million bushels based on the pace of sales and shipments to date and the increasing competitiveness of SRW wheat in world markets.  All wheat imports are also unchanged, but small adjustments raise projected HRW wheat imports 5 million bushels and reduce Hard Red Spring wheat and Durum imports by a combined 5 million bushels.  The projected range for the 2012/13 season-average farm price for all wheat is lowered 10 cents at the midpoint and narrowed to $7.65 to $8.15 per bushel, based on prices reported to date.Global wheat supplies for 2012/13 are projected slightly lower based on reduced production prospects in Argentina and lower reported production in Russia.  Argentina production is reduced 0.5 million tons with lower expected harvested area and yields.  Heavy December rains have increased expected area losses and harvest reports also suggest lower-than-expected yields.  Russia production is lowered 0.3 million tons based on the latest government reports that reduce yields slightly.Global wheat exports for 2012/13 are reduced slightly.  Projected exports are lowered 0.5 million tons each for Argentina, Australia, and Canada, but raised 0.5 million tons for Russia and 0.2 million tons for Ukraine.  Imports are raised 0.2 million tons for Iran.  Feed and residual use for Russia is lowered 0.5 million tons as available domestic supplies tighten.  World wheat ending stocks for 2012/13 are projected slightly lower with increases for Australia, Canada, and Iran mostly offset by reductions for the United States, Russia, and Ukraine.",
    "July_2013": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2013/14 are raised slightly this month with lower beginning stocks more than offset by higher production, both based on the latest survey-based estimates and forecasts.  Beginning stocks are reduced 27 million bushels as indicated by the June 1 stocks estimate reported in the June 28 Grain Stocks.  Production is forecast up 34 million bushels with lower forecast harvested area from the June 28 Acreage report more than offset by higher yields.  Production is raised 11 million bushels for Hard Red Winter and 30 million bushels for Soft Red Winter (SRW) wheat.  White Winter wheat is forecast down 7 million bushels.  For durum, a reduction in area is only partly offset by a higher yield with production forecast down 5 million bushels.  For other spring wheat, a reduction in area is more than offset by a higher yield forecast in today\u2019s Crop Production report, adding 4 million bushels to this month\u2019s production forecast.  July survey-based yield forecasts for durum and other spring wheat are up 1.6 bushels per acre from last month\u2019s trend based projections.Total U.S. wheat use for 2013/14 is raised 89 million bushels as lower expected domestic use is more than offset by higher projected exports.  Projected feed and residual disappearance is lowered 10 million bushels with stronger export demand, especially for SRW wheat.  Exports are projected 100 million bushels higher reflecting strong sales, particularly to China.  Ending stocks are projected down 83 million bushels.  At 576 million tons, stocks are expected to remain well above the 60-year low of 306 million in 2007/08.  The projected range for the 2013/14 season-average farm price is raised 20 cents on both ends to $6.45 to $7.75 per bushel.  At the $7.20-per-bushel midpoint, this would be down from the record $7.77 per bushel reported for 2012/13.Global wheat supplies for 2013/14 are lowered 3.5 million tons reflecting lower projected beginning stocks as world production rises 1.9 million tons.  Higher 2012/13 feed use in China accounts for most of the reduction in beginning stocks with smaller increases in domestic consumption for Pakistan, Russia, and Iran adding to the decline in 2012/13 global carryout.  World production for 2013/14 is raised with increases for Australia, the European Union, and the United States offsetting a reduction for Kazakhstan.  Australia production is raised 1.0 million acres reflecting the latest government estimates for area and a slightly higher yield outlook as early season conditions have been especially favorable in the country\u2019s southern and eastern growing areas.  Production for the European Union is raised 1.2 million tons, however, the addition of Croatia accounts for most of the increase.  Higher production prospects for Romania, Hungary, United Kingdom, and several smaller countries outweigh reductions for France, Ireland, and Spain.  Production is lowered 0.5 million tons for Kazakhstan with lower planted area reported by the Ministry of Agriculture.Global wheat consumption for 2013/14 is raised 5.4 million tons mostly reflecting higher expected feeding in China.  Wheat consumption is also raised for India, Pakistan, Iran, and Japan, offsetting reductions for the European Union and the United States.  Global wheat trade is raised with a 5.0-million-ton increase in China imports.  A 0.5-million-ton increase in imports for Iran is offset by the same size reduction for the European Union.  World exports are raised 5.0 million tons with increases for Australia, the European Union, and the United States.  Exports are lowered for India and Kazakhstan.  World ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected 8.9 million tons lower.  At 172.4 million tons, stocks would be the lowest since 2008/09, but well above the 128.8 million in 2007/08.",
    "June_2013": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2013/14 are raised this month with an increase in beginning stocks and higher forecast winter wheat production.  Beginning stocks are higher with a 15-million-bushel reduction in 2012/13 exports as May shipments fell below expectations.  Projected production for 2013/14 is up 23 million bushels as higher yields boost forecast production of Hard Red Winter wheat in the Southern and Central Plains and Soft Red Winter wheat across the South and Midwest.  Exports are projected 50 million bushels higher for 2013/14 with strong early season sales and a reduced outlook for foreign production this month.  Ending stocks for 2013/14 are projected down 11 million bushels.  Projected stocks of 659 million bushels remain at a 5-year low.  The projected range for the 2013/14 season-average farm price is raised 10 cents on both ends to $6.25 to $7.55 per bushel.  This is down from the record $7.80 per bushel expected for 2012/13.Global wheat supplies for 2013/14 are lowered 5.6 million tons reflecting lower foreign production.  World production is projected at 695.9 million tons, down 5.2 million from last month with reductions for Ukraine, Russia, and EU-27.  Persistent dry weather in key growing areas of southeastern Ukraine and adjoining areas of southern Russia reduces production prospects 2.5 million tons and 2.0 million tons, respectively.  EU-27 production is lowered 1.3 million tons with small reductions in a number of member countries.  Global wheat consumption for 2013/14 is reduced slightly with reductions in feed and residual use for EU-27, Russia, and Ukraine more than offsetting higher expected food use for India, Iran, and Egypt.  Global wheat trade is raised with imports increased 1.0 million tons for Iran.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton reduction in imports for EU-27 with lower exportable supplies in Ukraine.  Ukraine and Russia exports are lowered 1.5 million tons and 1.0 million tons, respectively.  Export increases of 1.5 million tons for EU-27 and 0.5 million tons for Canada, combine with the U.S. increase this month to raise global exports 0.8 million tons.

The projected 2022/23 season-average farm price (SAFP) is lowered $0.25 per bushel to $9.00 on reported NASS prices to date and expectations for cash and futures prices the remainder of 2022/23.  Despite the decline, $9.00 per bushel would remain a record SAFP. The 2022/23 global wheat outlook raises supplies, consumption, exports, and ending stocks this month.  Supplies increase by 3.6 million tons to 1,059.6 million, as production increases for Russia and Ukraine more than offset a decline in beginning stocks.  Production in Russia is forecast 3.0 million tons higher, to 91.0 million, on harvest results for winter wheat to date published by the Russian Ministry of Agriculture.  If realized, area harvested, yield, and production for Russia will all reach record highs.  The Ukraine production forecast is increased 1.0 million tons to 20.5 million as the harvest is nearly complete and government statistics reported higher yields in the Forest and Forest-Steppe zones.Larger supplies boost global consumption by 2.4 million tons to 791.0 million, almost entirely on increased feed and residual use as food, seed, and industrial use is nearly unchanged.  Feed and residual use in Russia is forecast 1.0 million tons higher to 21.0 million on additional supplies.  EU feed and residual use is increased 1.0 million tons to 44.0 million as wheat prices are now more competitive with feed grains, spurring demand.  Global trade is nearly unchanged, rising 0.2 million tons to 208.9 million as there were no changes for any of the major exporters.

    "November_2013": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2013/14 are raised 26 million bushels with higher estimated production and an increase in expected imports.  Production was raised 14 million bushels in the September 30 Small Grains report.  Production is further raised 2 million bushels for Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat and slightly for Durum based on the resurvey of North Dakota and Montana producers who had not finished harvesting when the September survey was completed for the Small Grains report. Imports are projected 10 million bushels higher with larger supplies in Canada and stronger food use expected for HRS wheat.  Food use for all wheat, however, is lowered 8 million bushels reflecting the latest flour production data reported by the North American Millers\u2019 Association with Hard Red Winter wheat food use reduced.  Feed and residual use is projected 30 million bushels higher based on indicated June-August disappearance from the September 1 stocks.  Projected ending stocks are raised 4 million bushels.  The projected range for the 2013/14 season-average wheat farm price is narrowed 20 cents on each end to $6.70 to $7.30 per bushel.  The midpoint of the range is unchanged from September at $7.00 per bushel.  Normally 60 percent or more of each year\u2019s crop is marketed from June through October and reported farm prices so far for this marketing year have averaged near $7.00 per bushel.Global 2013/14 wheat supplies are lowered 0.8 million tons as a decline in global output more than offsets higher beginning stocks, mostly in the European Union.  European Union production for 2012/13 is revised higher and domestic consumption is estimated lower boosting 2013/14 beginning stocks.  European Union production for 2013/14 is raised 0.4 million tons with small increases to reported crops in a number of member countries.  Canada production is raised 1.7 million tons in line with official estimates.  Global production, however, declines 2.6 million tons with production lowered 2.5 million tons for Russia, 1.5 million tons for Kazakhstan, and 1.0 million tons for Argentina.  Reductions for Russia and Kazakhstan reflect late-season harvest reports for spring wheat.  The reduction for Argentina is based on lower expected harvested area as dryness and late-season freeze events reduce prospects for a crop which will be harvested over the coming weeks. Global wheat consumption for 2013/14 is lowered 3.0 million tons with reductions in foreign feed and food use projected this month.  Feed use is lowered for China, Russia, and the European Union, more than offsetting a small increase for South Korea.  Food use is lowered for India, Russia, and the European Union.  Global wheat trade, in the aggregate, is mostly unchanged this month with imports raised for several African countries and Mexico, but lowered for China, the European Union, and the Philippines.  World exports decline slightly as reductions for Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Russia more than offset increases for Canada, the European Union, and India.

Supplies are raised 3.3 million tons to 1,070.3 million, mostly on higher production in Australia and Canada more than offsetting a smaller crop in Argentina.  Australia\u2019s production is raised 2.5 million tons to 28.5 million, mainly based on the ABARES production forecast issued September 7.  Canada\u2019s production is increased 2.0 million tons to 36.0 million, primarily on the Statistics Canada forecast issued August 31.  This is the second and third-highest wheat production on record for Canada and Australia, respectively.  Argentina\u2019s production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 19.5 million on continued dry conditions and possible frost damage.  On net, global 2020/21 production is raised 4.5 million tons to a record high 770.5 million.World consumption is increased 0.8 million tons to 750.9 million, primarily on higher feed and residual usage for Australia and Canada.  Projected 2020/21 global trade is raised 1.5 million tons to 189.4 million on higher exports for Australia and Canada.  The largest import change this month is for China, where imports are raised 1.0 million tons to 7.0 million on an early strong pace of U.S. sales and shipments to China and increased exportable supplies from Australia and Canada.  If realized, these would be the largest China wheat imports since 1995/96.

Partially offsetting these increases, Canadian production is lowered 1.0 million tons to 23.0 million, based on the Statistics Canada forecast issued August 30, and Argentina is reduced 500,000 tons to 20.0 million on dry conditions.   Projected 2021/22 world consumption is raised 3.0 million tons to 789.6 million.  Most of the higher consumption is for feed and residual use, led by China, increasing by 1.0 million tons to 36.0 million.  Projected 2021/22 global trade is raised 1.5 million tons to 199.7 million as higher exports by Australia and India more than offset reduced exports for Canada.

A 10-million-bushel decrease in imports is partially offsetting.  Production is raised on increased spring wheat production that more than offsets decreases for Hard Red Winter, Soft Red Winter, and White Wheat.  Overall yields for spring wheat are forecast above average.  Feed and residual use for all wheat in 2015/16 is raised 5 million bushels to 200 million on the larger crop.  All wheat exports for 2015/16 are raised 25 million bushels to 950 million on increased U.S. supplies and reduced wheat production in Canada.  These exports would be up 11 percent from the low level of 2014/15, but still well below the 5-year average.  Ending stocks are raised 28 million bushels to 842 million, the largest since the 2010/11.  Despite higher stocks, the season-average price is raised 35 cents to $4.75 to $5.75 per bushel on recently higher cash and futures prices and the rising outlook for corn prices, particularly in the summer months when a majority of this year\u2019s wheat crop will be marketed.  Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are raised 12.1 million tons primarily on increased beginning stocks.  China beginning stocks are raised 11.4 million tons on reductions to feed and residual use.  China wheat feeding fell substantially starting with the 2013/14 market year as wheat prices became uncompetitive with corn.  Partly offsetting is a 2.0-million-ton decrease for 2015/16 Australia beginning stocks mostly on a 1.6-million-ton revision to 2013/14 production as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Foreign 2015/16 production is lowered slightly as increased production in the Black Sea region is more than offset by reductions for EU and Canada.  Total world production is raised to 722.0 million tons; down from last year\u2019s record but still the second largest.  Global wheat consumption for 2015/16 is lowered 5.4 million tons primarily on the reduced feed and residual use for China.  Canada and EU wheat feed and residual use are reduced 0.7 and 0.5 million tons, respectively.  Partly offsetting is a 1.4-million-ton increase in India food use.  Global wheat exports are lowered 0.3 million tons to 158.1 million, down nearly 4 percent from the previous year.  The largest import reduction is for Iran, which is lowered 1.0 million tons on large supplies.  EU imports are raised 1.0 million tons with the smaller crop and more expected imports of feed-quality wheat from Ukraine.  China imports are raised 0.8 million tons on increased purchases.  Exports are raised 1.0 million tons each for Russia and Ukraine on larger crops and less competition from EU.  The largest exporter reductions are 1.5 million tons for EU and 1.0 million tons for Canada, both on smaller crops.

Beginning stocks are higher with a 5-million-bushel reduction in 2014/15 exports partly offset by a 2-million-bushel reduction in imports.  Projected production for 2015/16 is up 34 million bushels mainly on improved prospects for the Hard Red Winter wheat crop in the Central Plains following the late season rains.  However, early harvest reports indicate that some areas receiving excessive rainfall have lodging and increased disease pressure.  Feed use for 2015/16 is raised 15 million bushels to 195 million, and ending stocks increased 21 million bushels to 814 million.  These would be the largest ending stocks since the 2010/11.  The season-average farm price is reduced $0.10 per bushel on both ends to $4.40 to $5.40.

World wheat exports are raised 1.5 million tons with Russia and Ukraine each raised 1.0 million tons on larger crops.  Partially offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Argentina.  Foreign consumption is raised 2.6 million tons with almost all of it on higher feeding.  Feeding is raised 1.0 million tons in EU, 0.5 million tons in Russia, and 0.4 million tons in Thailand.  At 202.4 million tons, global stocks are down 0.9 million tons from last month but still the largest since 2009/10. ",
    "November_2016": "WHEAT:  Projected 2016/17 U.S. ending stocks are raised 5 million bushels to 1,143 million on a reduction in food use.  The food use change reflects the latest NASS Flour Milling Products report and expectations for the remainder of the market year.  By class, Hard Red Winter (HRW) use is raised 10 million bushels, Hard Red Spring (HRS) is lowered 10 million, and Durum is lowered 5 million.  Total exports are unchanged at 975 million bushels with 5-million-bushel increases for both HRW and HRS offsetting 5-million-bushel decreases for both Soft Red Winter and Durum.  The season-average farm price is unchanged.Global wheat supplies for 2016/17 are raised 1.7 million tons on a 0.3-million-ton production increase and higher beginning stocks.  The largest beginning stocks change is for Ukraine on expectations of lower food use more than offsetting higher feeding.  Global 2016/17 exports are lowered 0.5 million tons primarily on reduced Canadian exports as unfavorable precipitation at harvest damaged crop quality.  Global use for 2016/17 is raised 0.8 million tons led by increases in feed use for Ukraine, Canada, and Russia but partially offset by reduced food use in Ukraine.  As global supplies are rising faster than use, ending stocks are raised 0.9 million tons and remain record large.  ",
    "September_2019": "WHEAT:  The 2019/20 U.S. wheat supply and demand outlook is unchanged this month but there were offsetting by-class changes for wheat exports.  The projected season-average farm price is $4.80 per bushel, down $0.20 on NASS monthly prices reported to date and expectations for cash and futures prices for the remainder of the marketing year (MY).  Global wheat prices are expected to be restrained for the rest of the MY on greater 2019/20 exportable supplies for several major U.S. competitors compared to last year.   The global outlook for wheat this month is for lower supplies, reduced consumption and exports, and higher ending stocks.  Supplies are reduced primarily on lower production forecasts for Australia and Kazakhstan on continued dry conditions.  Australia\u2019s production is lowered 2 million tons to 19.0 million, mainly on the second consecutive year of drought in New South Wales and Queensland.  Kazakhstan\u2019s wheat production is lowered 1.5 million tons to 11.5 million on further deteriorating conditions, and this would be its lowest output since 2012/13.  This reduction in global production is tempered by higher carry-in stocks, which results in global supplies less than 1 million tons lower this month.  World exports are decreased by 1.8 million tons to 180.8 million on reductions for Australia and Kazakhstan.  Global consumption is lowered 1.9 million tons, led by declines for Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine.  Despite a reduction this month in global supplies, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected record large at 286.5 million tons with China comprising 51 percent of the total.  ",
    "September_2018": "WHEAT:  The U.S. 2018/19 wheat supply and demand estimates are unchanged from last month.  There are offsetting by-class changes for both exports and imports.  The season-average farm price range is unchanged at the midpoint of $5.10 per bushel and the range is narrowed $0.20 per bushel to $4.70 to $5.50.  Global wheat supplies for 2018/19 are raised 4.7 million tons on a 3.4-million-ton production increase and higher beginning stocks.  The Russian crop is raised 3.0 million tons on harvest results to date in the winter wheat region and continued excellent weather in the spring wheat belt.  Kazakhstan is raised 0.5 million tons also on excellent spring wheat conditions.  Production is increased 2.7 million tons in India to a record 99.7 million on updated government data.  These increases are partially offset by a 2.0-million-ton decrease in Australia and a 1.0-million-ton decrease in Canada, both reflecting continued dry conditions during the growing season.  Global exports are lowered 2.5 million tons with a 2.0-million-ton reduction for Australia and a 0.5-million-ton reduction for Canada, both on smaller crops.  Indonesia and Iran imports are down 1.0 million tons and 0.5 million tons, respectively.  Global use is raised 2.3 million tons primarily on a 2.0-million-ton increase for Russia feed and residual use and a 1.0-million-ton increase for EU feed and residual use.  With total supplies rising faster than use, global ending stocks are raised 2.3 million tons to 261.3 million but are 5 percent below last year\u2019s record.  COARSE GRAINS: This month\u2019s 2018/19 U.S. corn outlook is for larger production, increased domestic use, greater exports, and higher ending stocks.  Corn production is forecast at 14.827 billion bushels, up 241 million from last month on an increased yield forecast.  If realized, the crop would be the second highest on record.  Among the major producing states, yields are forecast to be record high in Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, and South Dakota.  Corn supplies are higher from last month, as a larger crop more than offsets a small decline in beginning stocks due to higher estimated exports for 2017/18.  Feed and residual use for 2018/19 is raised 50 million bushels with a larger crop and lower expected prices.  Corn used for ethanol is raised 25 million bushels.  With supply rising more than use, corn ending stocks are up 90 million bushels from last month.  The season-average corn price received by producers is projected 10 cents lower with a midpoint of $3.50 per bushel. Global coarse grain production for 2018/19 is forecast up 5.1 million tons to 1,347.2 million.  The 2018/19 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, greater consumption, increased trade, and reduced stocks relative to last month.  Foreign corn production is forecast higher than last month with projected increases for the EU, Angola, Paraguay, Turkey, and Serbia more than offsetting declines for Canada, South Africa, and Guatemala.  EU corn production is raised, mostly reflecting increases for Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and France. In both Bulgaria and Romania, yields are expected to be record high.  World barley production is lowered, with reductions for the EU, Australia, and Ukraine more than offsetting increases for Kazakhstan and Russia.Corn exports for 2018/19 are raised for Ukraine, Serbia, and Paraguay, but lowered for Canada and South Africa.  Imports are raised for the EU, Japan, Brazil, and Guatemala, with partly offsetting declines for Algeria and Saudi Arabia.  For 2017/18, exports are lowered for both Brazil and Argentina, reflecting slower-than-expected trade to date.  Foreign corn ending stocks for 2018/19 are down from last month, with declines for Argentina, South Africa, Ukraine, Canada, and Serbia more than offsetting increases for Angola, Paraguay, the EU, Brazil, Turkey, and India.  Global corn stocks, at 157.0 million tons, are up 1.5 million from last month.RICE: U.S. 2018/19 all rice supplies are raised 3.3 million cwt this month to 275.9 million as higher production more than offsets lower beginning stocks.  The August 24 NASS Rice Stocks report indicated lower 2017/18 ending stocks than previously forecast thereby reducing 2018/19 beginning stocks by 5.4 million cwt.  In the September Crop Production report, NASS increased the 2018/19 U.S. crop by 8.6 million cwt to 219.5 million on increased harvested acreage and yields.  NASS incorporated FSA certified acreage data this month.  The average all rice yield increased 40 pounds to 7,563 pounds per acre with forecast yields higher in California, Louisiana, and Texas.  Long-grain production is raised by 5.8 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain is increased by 2.8 million.  Total projected domestic and residual usage is increased by 2.0 million cwt to 133.0 million on larger supplies.  The all rice export forecast is unchanged at 98.0 million as a 1-million-cwt increase in long-grain on more competitive prices is offset by an equivalent reduction in medium- and short-grain on lower expected exports to Turkey.  All rice ending stocks are increased 1.3 million cwt to 44.9 million and are 53 percent higher than 2017/18.  The projected 2018/19 all-rice season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per cwt at the midpoint to a range of $11.20 to $12.20 with reductions in all rice class prices.  Global 2018/19 rice supplies are increased to 632.8 million tons, primarily on higher production and beginning stocks for India.  World production is fractionally lower as reductions in China and Bangladesh more than offset India\u2019s increased production.  Global consumption is increased by 0.6 million tons to 488.4 million, led by India.  World trade is raised to a record 49.5 million tons on higher India exports.  Global ending stocks increase 0.8 million tons to 144.4 million as higher projected stocks for India, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Burma more than offset reduced stocks for China.  ",
    "November_2017": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. 2017/18 ending stocks are lowered 25 million bushels due to increased exports.  Recent sales to Iraq support a higher export projection with Hard Red Winter accounting for the entire increase.  The latest NASS Flour Millings Products report, issued November 1, indicated only a modest increase for food use for 2016/17 and supported the current projection of 950 million bushels for 2017/18.  Ending stocks are projected at 935 million bushels, down 246 million from the previous year but still above the 5-year-average.  The season-average farm price is unchanged at a midpoint of $4.60.Global 2017/18 wheat supplies are down fractionally with decreased beginning stocks but increased production.  Global production is raised 0.8 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for the EU on updated harvest results.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton decrease for Pakistan.  Exports are raised 0.6 million tons with the United States and Russia up 0.7 million, and 0.5 million, respectively.  Australia exports are lowered 0.5 million.  Global use is raised fractionally this month.  With supplies decreasing and total use increasing, ending stocks are lowered 0.6 million tons but remain record large.  ",
    "June_2014": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are lowered this month as an increase in beginning stocks is more than offset by a reduction in forecast winter wheat production.  Beginning stocks are raised with a 10-million-bushel reduction in 2013/14 food use and offsetting 5-million-bushel reductions in 2013/14 imports and exports.  Projected production for 2014/15 is down 21 million bushels as reduced prospects for Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat in the Southern and Central Plains and White Winter wheat in the Pacific Northwest more than outweigh higher forecast Soft Red Winter wheat production across the South and Midwest.  Projected food use is lowered 10 million bushels for 2014/15 and for 2013/14.  This month\u2019s reduced outlook for food use assumes a higher flour extraction rate for both marketing years.  Exports for 2014/15 are projected 25 million bushels lower with tighter supplies of HRW wheat and stronger competition from major exporters.  Projected ending stocks are raised 34 million bushels.  The projected range for the 2014/15 season-average farm price is lowered 30 cents on both ends to $6.35 to $7.65 per bushel based on the larger expected carryout, higher global production, and recent sharp declines in futures prices.Global wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 4.1 million tons as a 5.2-million-ton increase in foreign production is only partly offset by a 0.8-million-ton reduction in foreign beginning stocks and this month\u2019s lower U.S. production outlook.  Beginning stocks are lowered for Australia, Russia, and Turkey with increases in 2013/14 exports this month.  World production for 2014/15 is projected at 701.6 million tons, up 4.6 million from last month with increases for India, the European Union, China, and Russia more than offsetting the decline in U.S. output.  India production is raised 1.9 million tons based on the latest official government estimate.  European Union production is raised 1.4 million tons as spring and early summer rainfall support higher yield outlooks for France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.  Production for China and Russia is raised 1.0 million tons each as favorable growing conditions also support higher expected yields.  \fGlobal wheat trade and consumption for 2014/15 are raised with larger foreign supplies.  Trade and consumption are also raised for 2013/14.  Increases in world imports and exports for 2014/15 are relatively small, but world consumption is raised 2.9 million tons with increased feeding expected in China and the European Union and increased food use projected for India, all supported by larger crops.  Exports for 2014/15 are raised 0.5 million tons each for the European Union and Russia, more than offsetting this month\u2019s reduction in U.S. export prospects.  World ending stocks for 2014/15 are projected 1.2 million tons higher with much of the increase in the United States.  At 188.6 million tons, global stocks are up 2.6 million year-to-year.",
    "July_2014": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised this month with a sharp increase in forecast Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat more than offsetting a decrease for Hard Red Winter (HRW).  The HRW crop was damaged by drought and April freezes in the Southern and Central plains; however, the HRS crop in the Northern Plains has benefitted from abundant soil moisture and cooler than normal early summer temperatures.  Yields for Durum and other spring wheat are forecast to be above average.  Feed and residual use for all wheat in 2014/15 is lowered 15 million bushels to 145 million as tight supplies of HRW wheat and relatively more attractive prices for feed grains reduce expected feed and residual use.  All wheat exports for 2014/15 are lowered 25 million bushels reflecting expectations of large world supplies and strong competition in export markets.  Ending stocks are projected 86 million bushels higher.  The projected season-average farm price range is lowered 40 cents at the midpoint to $6.00 to $7.20 per bushel.  Global wheat supplies for 2014/15 are raised 1.8 million tons with increased production more than offsetting lower beginning stocks.  World production is raised 3.6 million tons to 705.2 million.  This is down 9.0 million tons from last year but still the second largest production on record.  The biggest foreign increases are 1.6 million tons for the EU and 1.0 million tons for Ukraine both due to continued favorable weather.  Production is raised 0.5 million tons for Australia based on the latest government indications for area.  Production is also raised 0.3 million tons each for Brazil and Serbia.  Partly offsetting this month\u2019s production increases is a reduction of 1.0 million tons for Kazakhstan due to June dryness and a decline of 0.5 million tons for Canada based on the latest area indications from Statistics Canada.Global wheat consumption is raised 0.9 million tons with increased wheat feeding for the EU and higher food use for several countries.  EU wheat feeding is raised 1.0 million tons as wheat quality is expected to suffer in the lower Danube region because of excessive rainfall in recent weeks.  Feeding reductions for Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Thailand are partly offsetting.  Food use is raised for Indonesia, Sudan, Morocco, and Bangladesh but lowered for Egypt.  Global wheat trade for 2014/15 is lowered with exports reduced 1.0 million tons for Kazakhstan and 0.7 million for the United States.  Partly offsetting increases in exports are made for Australia, Ukraine, and Serbia with improved crop prospects.  EU imports are lowered 0.5 million tons due in part to larger expected supplies of feed quality wheat in Bulgaria and Romania.  Imports are also lowered for Egypt and Mexico, but raised for Sudan, Indonesia, and Nigeria.

A 5-million-bushel decrease in imports is minimally offsetting.  Production is raised throughout the wheat belt.  Winter wheat yields are projected to be record high, and spring wheat yields are slightly above average.  Feed and residual use for 2016/17 is raised 100 million bushels to 300 million on the larger supplies and increased wheat price competitiveness with corn.  U.S. exports are raised 25 million bushels to 925 million, which would be the highest in 3 years.  Ending stocks are raised 55 million bushels to 1,105 million bushels, the highest since 1988/89.  With the large increase in carryover stocks, the season-average farm price is lowered $0.20 per bushel at the midpoint to a projected range of $3.40 to $4.20.  Global 2016/17 wheat supplies are raised 9.2 million tons to 983.0 million on increased production as well as a 1.5-million-ton increase in beginning stocks.  Foreign production is raised 2.7 million tons led by 1.0-million-ton increases for both Russia and Ukraine on favorable weather.  Production for Argentina, Australia, and Canada are each raised 0.5 million tons.  These increases are partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton decrease for the EU on heavy rain in France and a 0.7-million-ton decrease for Algeria on a worse-than-expected impact from drought.  Total world production is now projected at a record 738.5 million tons.  Global use for 2016/17 is raised 13.3 million tons to 729.3 million, primarily on increased feed use, stemming from the large world supplies and heavy late-season rain in several production regions.  Feed use in China and the EU are raised 5.5 million tons and 1.5 million tons, respectively.  Global food and industrial use is raised 1.7 million tons, led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for China.  Global 2016/17 exports are raised 2.8 million tons on increased supplies and strong demand in several countries.  Foreign export increases are led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Ukraine, and 0.5 million tons each for Argentina, Australia, Canada, Russia, and Turkey.  The increases are partly offset by a 1.5-million-ton reduction for EU exports on a smaller crop and increased domestic feed use.

    "June_2016": "WHEAT:  Projected U.S. wheat supplies for 2016/17 are raised this month on both increased beginning stocks and larger winter wheat production.  Beginning stocks are raised slightly with a 3-million-bushel decrease in 2015/16 imports partially offsetting a 5-million-bushel export reduction.  Projected production for 2016/17 is up 79 million bushels mainly on improved prospects for the Hard Red Winter wheat crop in the Great Plains following excellent growing conditions throughout the spring months.  Consequently, the winter wheat yield is forecast to be record high.  Feed and residual use for 2016/17 is raised 30 million bushels to 200 million on the larger crop as well as increased wheat price competitiveness with corn.  Imports are lowered 5 million bushels, and exports are raised 25 million bushels to 900 million, up significantly from the previous year\u2019s depressed total but still below the five year-average.  Ending stocks are raised 21 million bushels to 1,050 million, the largest in 29 years.  Global wheat supplies for 2016/17 are raised 3.9 million tons with production increases for the EU, Russia, and the United States more than offsetting reductions for Brazil and Mexico.  The EU production increase is entirely for Spain and reflects favorable growing conditions as confirmed with satellite imagery data.  The production forecast for France is unchanged despite heavy rain for the month of May.  Although abundant precipitation can reduce yield prospects in low-lying areas, it may increase yield elsewhere.  French wheat was in excellent condition prior to the onset of the rain and expectations for a return to dryness in the latter part of the grain filling stage is anticipated to further mitigate crop losses.  Production in Russia is increased on updated government estimates showing larger spring wheat area.  Foreign exports for 2016/17 are up 1.0 million tons with the EU and Russia each up 0.5 million tons given their increased production.  The primary global import changes are a 1.0-million-ton increase for India on low international prices increasing demand, and a 0.4-million-ton increase for Indonesia.  Total world consumption is up 3.4 million tons led by a 1.2-million-ton increase for India food use, a 1.0-million-ton increase for EU feed use, and a 0.4-million-ton increase for Indonesia feed use.

Exports would be the lowest since 1971/72; ending stocks are the highest since 2009/10.  Wheat exports are lowered on a very slow pace to date and continued lack of U.S. price competitiveness.  The projected range for the 2015/16 U.S. season-average farm price is narrowed 5 cents on both the high and low ends to $4.80 to $5.20 per bushel. Global wheat supplies for 2015/16 are lowered 0.2 million tons on decreased beginning stocks partially offset by a small production increase.  A 2.0-million-ton increase for EU production is partially offset by a 1.0-million-ton reduction for Australia and a 0.5-million-ton decrease for Russia.  The EU and Russia changes stem from harvest reports to date.  The Australia change reflects very hot and dry October conditions affecting grain fill and lowering yield potential.  The global wheat crop is now projected at 733.0 million tons, a third consecutive record. Foreign wheat exports for 2015/16 are raised 1.2 million tons led by a 1.0-million-ton increase for Canada on pace to date.

Partly offsetting is a 1.4-million-ton increase for EU.  Changes for Northern Hemisphere countries reflect updated harvest reports and government statistics.  Australia is lowered on persistent dryness in portions of the southeast that continued through October.  Global wheat consumption for 2014/15 is lowered 1.4 million tons due mainly to reductions for Egypt food and feed use, which stem from changes to their bread subsidy program.  Global wheat imports are lowered 1.3 million tons to 153.4 million.  Egypt imports are lowered 0.8 million tons due to the new subsidy program that will change consumption patterns.  South Korea imports are lowered 0.4 million tons on reduced feed quality wheat imports; China, Pakistan and Russia imports are each lowered 0.3 million tons.  Partly offsetting the reductions are 0.3-million-ton increases for both Mexico and Turkey imports.  The largest exporter decrease is 1.0 million tons for Australia on a smaller crop.  Kazakhstan and Serbia exports were each lowered 0.2 million tons also due to smaller crops.  A 0.3-million-ton increase in Turkey exports was partially offsetting.

Projected 2017/18 U.S. wheat production is slightly increased by 3.8 million bushels to 1,824 million.  The NASS June Crop Production report indicates higher Hard Red Winter and Soft Red Winter wheat production forecasts, which more than offset a reduced White Winter wheat crop.  All of the wheat use categories are unchanged this month.  The net supply increase raises projected 2017/18 ending stocks by 10.8 million bushels to 924.3 million.  Carryout remains 20 percent below last year.  The 2017/18 season-average farm price is projected at $3.90 to $4.70 per bushel, up 5 cents on both ends of the range.  The mid-point of this range is up $0.40 from 2016/17.  High-protein wheat supplies are expected to remain constrained in 2017/18, resulting in relatively higher prices for this wheat.   Global wheat supplies for 2017/18 are raised 2.8 million tons, primarily on higher forecast wheat production for Russia, which is up 2.0 million tons to 69.0 million.  Conditions continue to be favorable for winter wheat in most areas since the crop emerged from dormancy.  Turkey\u2019s wheat production is also forecast higher, up 0.5 million tons to 18.0 million on improved crop conditions this spring.

Forecast 2017/18 U.S. wheat production is lowered 64 million bushels to 1,760 million.  The NASS July Crop Production report provides survey-based production forecasts for all wheat classes for the first time in the 2017/18 crop year.  The production forecasts for durum and other spring wheat indicated a significant decline compared to last year for these two classes primarily due to severe drought conditions affecting the Northern Plains.  Partially offsetting this decrease is higher winter wheat production on both higher harvested acreage and yield.  Projected exports and feed and residual usage are lowered to 975 and 150 million bushels, respectively, largely on the reduction in durum and other spring wheat supplies.  Projected 2017/18 ending stocks are raised 14 million bushels to 938 million this month, but are 21 percent lower than last year\u2019s revised stocks.  The 2017/18 season-average farm price is raised $0.50 per bushel at the midpoint to a projected range of $4.40 to $5.20.  Global 2017/18 wheat supplies are decreased fractionally on lower production forecasts for the U.S., Australia, China, and the EU, which are partially offset by higher production expected for Russia and Turkey.  Russia\u2019s wheat production is increased by 3.0 million tons to 72.0 million as growing conditions to date are similar to last year when Russia achieved record yields.  Turkey\u2019s wheat production is up 1.5 million tons to 19.5 million on favorable crop conditions.  European Union wheat production is down 0.8 million tons to 150.0 million on smaller expected crops in Spain and France.  Australia\u2019s 2017/18 production is reduced 1.5 million tons to 23.5 million on dry conditions.   Foreign 2017/18 exports are increased on higher exports for Russia and Turkey more than offsetting reductions for the EU, Paraguay, and Ukraine.  Imports are projected lower for several countries with Turkey showing the largest reduction on a significantly larger crop.  Total world consumption is projected higher, primarily on greater use by Russia on increased supplies.  Global ending stocks are projected lower at 260.6 million tons, down marginally from last month.   "
